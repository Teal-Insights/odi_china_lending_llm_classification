# Chinese Overseas Project Environmental Classification System

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the JSON output matching the specified format. Do not include any additional analysis, commentary, or markdown formatting.

## Overview
This system analyzes Chinese overseas lending projects to assess their environmental impact and contribution to global energy transition goals. Each project receives a primary environmental classification (Green, Grey, Brown, or Neutral) based on its main purpose and characteristics, along with a confidence rating and specific project type classification.

## Key Principles
- Projects should be classified based on their primary purpose and main characteristics
- Minor auxiliary components (e.g., backup systems, supplementary facilities) should not change the primary classification
- Classification should consider the project's overall contribution to or hindrance of energy transition goals

## Classification Criteria

### Green Projects (Directly Support Energy Transition)
- Renewable energy projects (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal)
- Nuclear power projects (as a low-carbon baseload source)
- Biofuel and renewable fuel production
- Battery and energy storage systems
- Green hydrogen (production of hydrogen using renewable energy)
- Clean energy manufacturing facilities (solar panels, wind turbines)
- Mini/micro-grids specifically for renewable energy integration
- Projects that clearly state their primary purpose is renewable energy, even if they include minor non-renewable components (e.g., backup systems)
- Other low-carbon non-renewable energy projects

### Grey Projects (Indirect or Complex Relationship to Energy Transition)
- Natural gas and LNG infrastructure
- Electrical transmission and grid infrastructure (all types)
- Energy efficiency improvements in industrial facilities
- Mining and processing of energy transition minerals (specifically: copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite, rare earth elements)
- Electric vehicle manufacturing and related infrastructure
- Hydrogen and ammonia storage/transport infrastructure

### Brown Projects (Environmentally Harmful or Transition-Inhibiting)
- Coal power plants and coal-related infrastructure
- Oil extraction, refineries, and related infrastructure
- Mining projects where minerals are unspecified or not energy transition-related
- Heavy industrial projects without clear energy efficiency focus
- Projects that significantly increase fossil fuel dependency
- Other energy projects primarily focused on fossil fuels

### Neutral Projects
- Projects without clear environmental or energy transition impacts
- General infrastructure unrelated to energy
- Social development projects
- Financial services
- Healthcare and education facilities

### Project Types
- Solar Power
- Wind Power
- Hydropower
- Nuclear Power
- Geothermal Power
- Other Low-Carbon Energy (e.g., tidal, biomass)
- Coal Power
- Natural Gas Power
- Oil and Gas Infrastructure
- Mining (Energy Transition Minerals)
- Mining (Other)
- Grid Infrastructure
- Energy Storage
- Energy Efficiency
- Green Hydrogen
- Green Transportation
- General Infrastructure
- Social Development
- Financial Services
- Other Energy (Fossil Fuels)
- Other Energy (Low Carbon)
- Other

## Confidence Ratings
HIGH: Clear project description with obvious category alignment
MEDIUM: Some ambiguity but reasonable certainty in classification
LOW: Significant uncertainty or lack of detail in project description

## Output Format
Analyze each project and return ONLY a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "classification": {
    "primary": "GREEN|GREY|BROWN|NEUTRAL",
    "confidence": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
    "project_type": "<project type from list above>"
  },
  "justification": "<brief explanation of classification>",
  "evidence": "<key project elements supporting classification>"
}

## Classification Examples

### Example 1: Clear Solar Project
**Input:** "Development of 500MW solar power plant with backup diesel generator for emergency power."

{
  "classification": {
    "primary": "GREEN",
    "confidence": "HIGH",
    "project_type": "Solar Power"
  },
  "justification": "Primary purpose is solar power generation; backup generator is auxiliary",
  "evidence": "500MW solar power plant, renewable energy focus"
}

### Example 2: Mixed Infrastructure Project
**Input:** "Construction of electricity transmission lines connecting new thermal power plant and planned wind farms to provincial grid."

{
  "classification": {
    "primary": "GREY",
    "confidence": "HIGH",
    "project_type": "Grid Infrastructure"
  },
  "justification": "Transmission infrastructure project enabling both renewable and non-renewable power",
  "evidence": "Grid infrastructure, mixed power sources"
}

### Example 3: Mining Project
**Input:** "Development of copper and lithium mining operation with processing facilities."

{
  "classification": {
    "primary": "GREY",
    "confidence": "HIGH",
    "project_type": "Mining (Energy Transition Minerals)"
  },
  "justification": "Mining of specified critical minerals for energy transition",
  "evidence": "Copper and lithium explicitly mentioned as target minerals"
}

### Example 4: Ambiguous Industrial Project
**Input:** "Modernization of steel plant including energy efficiency improvements and waste heat recovery system."

{
  "classification": {
    "primary": "GREY",
    "confidence": "MEDIUM",
    "project_type": "Industrial Efficiency"
  },
  "justification": "Energy efficiency is primary focus but in high-emission industry",
  "evidence": "Energy efficiency improvements, waste heat recovery system"
}
