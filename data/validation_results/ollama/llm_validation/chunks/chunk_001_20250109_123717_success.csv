# Title
China Eximbank provides RMB 426 million government concessional loan for Djibouti Assal Lake Salt Export Terminal Project at the Port of Goubet

# Description
On November 11, 2012, the Chinese Government and the Government of Djibouti signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the Djibouti Assal Lake Salt Export Terminal Project at the Port of Goubet. Then, on November 19, 2012, China Eximbank and Djibouti’s Ministry of Finance signed an RMB 426,000,000 (FDJ 11,400,000,000/$63,998,908) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Djibouti Assal Lake Salt Export Terminal Project at the Port of Goubet. The borrowing terms of the GCL were as follows: a 7.5-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, a 2.5% interest rate, a 0.5% management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee. According to Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry, the GCL (loan) had achieved a 20.8% disbursement rate as of 2014 ($13,354,884 out of $63,998,908) and it ultimately achieved a 82.4% disbursement rate (FDJ 9,388,000,000 out of FDJ 11,400,000,000).  The cargo facility at the Port of Goubet was designed to facilitate the export of salt and gypsum deposits from Lake Assal, the world’s largest undeveloped salt reserve and the second most saline body of water on Earth after Don Juan Pond in Antarctica. This project sought to create a port with a depth of 14 meters, and a terminal bulk carrier located 17 meters from the extraction zone. The project also involved the rehabilitation of a 8.4 km road connecting the terminal to the extraction zone. The Port of Goubet is located 40 km south of the Gulf of Goubet, and its construction was designed to help Djibouti export 5 million tons of salt annually to Southeast Asian countries.   China Harbor Engineering Company Ltd., a subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company Ltd., was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on November 7, 2013, and the President of Djibouti inaugurated the mineral port on June 22, 2017.    The completion of this project paved the way for a longer-term commercial investment by China Harbor Engineering Company Ltd. and China Communications Construction Company Ltd..

32192,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides RMB 3.53 billion overseas investment loan for 246 MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project,"On January 18, 2017, China National Heavy Machinery Corporation (CHMC) and the Cambodian Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) signed a feasibility study agreement regarding the 246 MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. The feasibility report was completed in June 2007. It was conducted by two Chinese firms: China Jikan Research Institute of Engineering Investigations and Design Co., Ltd. and Powerchina Northwest Engineering Corporation Limited. The feasibility report was then reviewed in September 2007 by a group of experts organized by China Hydropower Engineering Consulting Group Co. (CHECC) — a subsidiary of China Electric Power Construction Group Co., Ltd. — and again in February 2008 by Cambodia’s MME. Then, in June 2008, China National Heavy Machinery Corporation (CHMC) and the Cambodian Government signed a build-operate and transfer (BOT) agreement regarding the 246MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project.   The 42 year agreement includes a 5-year construction period (1 year for preparation and 4 years for construction) and a 37-year operating period. In addition, an execution agreement, power purchase agreement (PPA), and BOT land lease agreement were signed by CHMC, Cambodia’s Ministry of Economy and Finance, Cambodia’s MME, and Electricité du Cambodge (EDC) — a Cambodian state-owned power company — in June 2008. On November 17, 2008, China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) issued a letter of interest, which conveyed its willingness to provide insurance for the $540 million project. Two months later, on January 12, 2009, China Eximbank issued a letter of interest, which conveyed its willingness to provide a loan for the 246 MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. Then, in August 2009, China’s National Development and Reform Commission formally approved CHMC’s investment in the 246MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project, which enabled China Eximbank to grant credit support to the project.   On June 9, 2010, China Eximbank and Cambodian Tatay Hydropower Limited (CTHL or 柬埔寨達岱水電有限公司) — a special purpose vehicle and project company that is wholly owned by another special purpose vehicle called Beijing Sanlian International Investment Co., Ltd., which in turn is owned by China National Heavy Machinery Corporation (93.13% equity stake) and CHINT Group (6.88% equity stake) — signed an overseas investment loan (境外投资贷款) agreement worth RMB 3,533,622,000 for the 246 MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. The loan was issued in three tranches worth RMB 1,349,831,300, RMB 1,195,191,300, and RMB 988,599,400 yuan, respectively. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. The parties also signed a mortgage agreement, stipulating that CTHL would provide a mortgage guarantee for all its properties (tangible or intangible) and all rights (existing or in the future) to China Eximbank. Sinosure also provided insurance for the overseas investment loan.   The proceeds of the China Eximbank loan were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial (EPC) contract that it signed with China Gezhouba Group Company Limited (CGGC) on February 10, 2010. The purpose of the project was to construct a hydroelectric power plant with a new reservoir (whose water surface area is 16,000,000m2 with a power density of 15.375W/m2) downstream of the Tatay River in Thma Bang District and Koh Kong Province and thereby generate power from clean renewable hydropower in Koh Kong Province and contribute to the sustainability of the Phnom Penh Power Grid. It involved the installation of 3 sets of turbine and generators (3×82MW), which amount to a total capacity of 246MW and a total net electricity supply of 857,300MWh (to be sold to the Phnom Penh Power Grid). It relied upon technology manufactured by Zhejiang Fuchunjiang Hydropower Equipments Co., Ltd in China.   The project was a diversion type hydropower station. Two dams were constructed to form a new reservoir. The concrete face rock-fill dam was located on the main stream of Tatay river and the auxiliary dam was located in Stung Kep River which is a tributary of the Tatay River. The three-opening bank spillway was located on the left bank of the Stung Kep River. The headrace power system and the river-side ground powerhouse were located at the left bank of the Tatay River; access roads to the dam crest and project site were provided on the left bank. The maximum height of the main dam located on the main stream was 110 meters, and the maximum height of the dam located on the Stung Kep River was 77 meters. A new reservoir was formed with the water surface of 16,000,000m2 and the power density is 15.375W/m2 . The designed net water head for the power generation was 188 meters. The power generated by the plant was to be routed to the 230kV O-Saom Substation though a 65km 230kV transmission line to Phnom Penh power grid. The project required the excavation of 7 million m3 of earth and 900,000 m3 of stone, for an active water storage capacity estimated at 322 m3 and an overall reservoir capacity of 439 million m3.   The project is located in Thmabang District within Koh Kong (Khétt Kaôh Kông) Province, which has central geographical coordinates at powerhouse: 103°10′11″E, 11°35′23″N; dam on Tatay River: 103°15′44″E, 11°37′46″N (i.e. powerhouse: 103.1697°E, 11.5897°N; dam on Tatay River: 103.2622°E, 11.6294°N). The dam site of the proposed project is 1.4 km upstream of the junction between Tatay River and its tributary named Stung Kep and 40km away from Koh Kong City, the capital of Koh Kong Province. China Gezhouba Group Company Limited (CGGC or 中国葛洲坝集团股份有限公司) was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, Zhejiang Fuchunjiang Hydropower Equipment Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Zhefu Holding Group Ltd., was a subcontractor responsible for the dam’s three 82MW generators.    In June 2009, preliminary results from the project’s environmental impact assessment (EIA), conducted by Key Consultants Cambodia (KCC) on behalf of CTHL, were released at a public forum. The full EIA was completed in September 2010. Then, in February 2010, it was announced that CGGC had won the construction contract bid. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on May 21, 2009; however, construction did not begin until March 29, 2010. Then, on November 5, 2010, Mr. Li Ruogu, President of China Eximbank conducted a project site inspection. The main dam was finished before the 2011 rainy season, and the auxiliary dam and spillway capacity were completed one year later. The main dam was finished before the 2011 rainy season, and the auxiliary dam and spillway capacity were completed one year later. In 2012, the European consulting firm Pöyry accepted a two-year contract with CTHL to provide monitoring of dam engineering, design, construction, quality, materials, and safety until 2014. As of February 8, 2012, construction was reportedly 20% complete. The access tunnel was completed in February 2013. Then, on June 23, 2013, Cambodia experienced 50-year monsoonal rains, flooding the project and suspending much of the construction. CHMC quickly deployed rescue workers to move construction equipment and build dikes. By the next day, the flood was under control and the damage contained. By the fall of 2013, the main dam passed the gate-closing requirements as determined by a Chinese team of experts and reviewed by Pöyry. After approval, the gate was closed and water storage officially began on November 16, 2013. The diversion tunnels for both dams were also finished in November 2013.   The originally expected project completion date was November 30, 2013; however, the first of the dam’s three 82MW generators did not begin to produce electricity until August 13, 2014. CHMC Board Chairman and President Mr. Lu Wenjun, and Mr. Zhu Xu attended a grid connection and commissioning ceremony on August 13, 2014. By December 2015, all three 82MW generators were active and the dam was fully operational. A project acceptance and power generation ceremony took place on December 23, 2015. The ceremony was attended by both Prime Minister Hun Sen and Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Bu Jianguo. Then, in November 2019, China Eximbank conducted an on-site, post-loan inspection. Under terms of a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), China National Heavy Machinery Corporation (CHMC), the majority shareholder of project owner and operator CTHL’s parent company, sells the electricity generated by the power plant at 7.45 cents per kilowatt-hour to EDC, thereby generating approximately $12 million of tax revenue a year. All electric power generated by the hydropower station is sent to the Phnom Penh-Battambang transmission and distribution lines. Since operationalization, the dam’s three generators have had an average annual production capacity of 849 GW*h14 that, in 2020, represented almost 24 percent of Cambodia’s total hydropower generation (3,493 GW*h) and 10 percent of Cambodia’s total domestic electricity production (8,513 GW*h). The 246MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project qualified for Certified Emission Reduction (CER) credits via the CDM under the UNFCCC as a renewable power source. The CDM credit system projected the dam would provide an annual greenhouse gas emission reduction of 393,329 tons of CO2 equivalents. The CER credits guaranteed by the project were then sold to the Netherlands via Gazprom Marketing & Trading Singapore between September 2013 and 2020. The project was recently re-certified by Shenzhen CTI International Certification to allow the same credits to be sold to the Netherlands for the next seven years between September 2020 to August 2027.","1.

The supplier's credit agreement was reportedly finalized on June 30, 2001. The Government of Bangladesh provided a sovereign guarantee for the supplier's credit on June 17, 2001.   The purpose of this project was to construct a nine kilometer 132 KV power supply line, a nine kilometer 132 KV underground cable, a 17 kilometer 33 KV overhead line, a 33 kilometer 33 KV underground cable, and install three 132/33 KV substations with a capacity of 450 MVA. Additionally, through the project, 268 switching stations (11 KV), 82 panels ( 11 KV), a 437.25 kilometer 11 KV underground and aerial cable with necessary accessories, and 1500 pole-mounted sub-stations were to be installed by GIETC. The expected completion date of the project was June 30, 2003.  Xinjiang TBEA and Dhaka Power Distribution Company of Bangladesh, signed a contract for the Dhaka smart grid and upgrade project, which exceeded 11.1 billion yuan. This may be an extension of the project signed in 2001.

It purchased 98% of the plant's assets, saving the over 100-year-old plant from bankruptcy.    In order to support the acquisition from Železara Smederevo, the Hebei Branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) provided an EUR 27.6 million acquisition loan (captured via Project ID#95965) and an EUR 50 million working capital loan  (captured via Project ID#95935)  to Hesteel Group Company Limited. These loans were backed by a credit insurance policy from Sinosure.

The loan's amount outstanding was TJS 276,008,000 as of December 31, 2016, TJS 309,047,000 as of December 31, 2017, TJS 330,444,000 as of December 31, 2018, TJS 339,472,000 as of December 31, 2019, and TJS 395,990,000 as of December 31, 2020.  The project involved the reconstruction of Regar substation, which is located near the city of Tursunzoda about 50km west of Dushanbe.  TBEA Co., Ltd. was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on November 22, 2012. The substation was put into operation on June 1, 2016.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Regar Substation Reconstruction Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to a 2021 IMF report, ‘[OHSHC “Barqi Tojik”] has significant arrears to the government on [foreign exchange] denominated loans. The government on-lends concessional [foreign exchange] loans […] from multilateral and bilateral agencies to [OHSHC “Barqi Tojik”] on non-concessional terms. These loans are denominated in [foreign exchange] and are intended to develop the energy infrastructure. However, these debts are not serviced fully, resulting in [foreign exchange] arrears to the government.’ A 2021 report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) elaborated on this point, explaining that ‘[a] high rate of uncollected payments for electricity use due to illegal connections, power theft and outdated metering infrastructure contribute to the worsening financial health of Barki Tojik.’ Then, in March 2023, the IMF published a report, which noted that ‘[I]n 2021 the SOE sector […] kept accumulating debt service losses, where within a year the amount of debt overdue payments […] increased from TJS 14 billion to TJS 17 billion (17.1 percent of GDP). Some 93 percent of accumulated overdue debt belongs to [OHSHC “Barqi Tojik”].’

The first is an RMB 400 million syndicated loan agreement with a 2.65% interest rate and a 10-year maturity. China Eximbank's contribution to the RMB-denominated facility is captured in Project ID#53985 and CDB's contribution to the RMB-denominated facility is captured in Project ID#92503.

China Eximbank's contribution to the USD-denominated facility is captured in Project ID#54287 and CDB's contribution to the USD-denominated facility is captured in Project ID#92501. The borrower purchased credit insurance from Sinosure for both of these syndicated loans. The borrower, ASDPL, was expected to use the loan proceeds to partially finance two commercial (EPC) contracts that it signed on on June 27, 2015: an RMB 863.316 million offshore supply contract that it signed with China First Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd. and an RMB 135.683 million onshore construction contract with MCC Ruba International Construction Company (Pvt) Ltd. The total project cost was $149.154 million and it was financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 79:21. ASDPL achieved financial close on November 6, 2015, which is typically the date of the first loan disbursement.   The project was implemented on a build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) basis and it involved the construction of a 100 MW solar PV power plant located at Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park at Lal Sohanra in Cholistan within Bahawalpur District of the Province of Punjab. China First Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd and MCC Ruba International Construction Company (Pvt) Ltd were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. This project reached its commercial operations date (COD) on May 31, 2016.   However, this project has encountered debt repayment and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. In May 2022, reports emerged that the Government of Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to Zonergy and its subsidiaries/SPVs. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 10.4 billion (approximately $52 million). Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’.

The IDB would also administer a B loan (Loan 3500B/OC-UR-1-US-FITCPIB, Loan 3500B/OC-UR-2-US-FITCPIB), which would be financed by another commercial bank or financial institution. The IDB lists the total anticipated project cost as 139,220,000 USD, with an expected 54,220,000 USD of counterpart financing.  The IDB approved this loan financing on 7 July 2015, and it refers to this project as ""UR-L1100 : Casablanca and Giacote Solar PV Project"". The loan recipients listed in the approval document were Giacote S.A., Raditon S.A., Dicano S.A., Fenima S.A. and Petilocoran S.A. The project sponsors would be Sky Solar and Lafemir S.A.  The project consists of solar plants located in the departments of Paysandú, Salto and Río Negro in northwestern Uruguay. The plants include Raditon (8MW, Paysandú), Fenima (9.5MW, Paysandú), Dicano (11.25MW, Paysandú), Petilcoran (9.5MW, Paysandú), Menafra Solar (20 MW, Río Negro), and Arapey Solar (10 MW, Salto). Construction on the plants began in November 2016. The expected end date of the project was June 2017. As of 2 August 2020, according to implementing agency Tecnogroup, all photovoltaic projects are still under construction.

The IDB would also administer a B loan (Loan 3500B/OC-UR-1-US-FITCPIB, Loan 3500B/OC-UR-2-US-FITCPIB), which would be financed by another commercial bank or financial institution. The IDB lists the total anticipated project cost as 139,220,000 USD, with an expected 54,220,000 USD of counterpart financing.  The IDB approved this loan financing on 7 July 2015, and it refers to this project as ""UR-L1100 : Casablanca and Giacote Solar PV Project"". The loan recipients listed in the approval document were Giacote S.A., Raditon S.A., Dicano S.A., Fenima S.A. and Petilocoran S.A. The project sponsors would be Sky Solar and Lafemir S.A.  The project consists of solar plants located in the departments of Paysandú, Salto and Río Negro in northwestern Uruguay. The plants include Raditon (8MW, Paysandú), Fenima (9.5MW, Paysandú), Dicano (11.25MW, Paysandú), Petilcoran (9.5MW, Paysandú), Menafra Solar (20 MW, Río Negro), and Arapey Solar (10 MW, Salto). Construction on the plants began in November 2016. The expected end date of the project was June 2017. As of 2 August 2020, according to implementing agency Tecnogroup, all photovoltaic projects are still under construction.  With a total installed capacity of 69.9MW the project will supply an average of 125.4 GWh of electricity per year to the national grid, helping to diversify Uruguay’s energy matrix and eliminating approximately 74,000 tons per year of CO2 emissions. The photovoltaic panels will be mounted over fixed steel structures expected to be provided locally through a joint venture between Lafemir S.A. and an industry-leading manufacturer. Resources will also be used to support the implementation of a climate change education initiative that will encourage young people to use their creativity and energy to come up with feasible, sustainable, long-term strategies to mitigate climate change. The “Rise Up” initiative will start in three rural primary schools in the department of Paysandú.  According to ProQuest, the project was completed 12/31/2017.  The China Co-Financing Fund was established on 14 January 2013 with a contribution of 2 billion USD by the People's Bank of China, and it is administered by the IDB.

Then, on September 3, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Ghana signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 2.1 billion ($330 million). The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 17.2 year-maturity (final maturity date: November 21, 2025), a 5-year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2013), an interest rate of CIRR plus a margin of 0.75% (6.13%), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity (final maturity date: September 3, 2028), a 7 year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2015), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL is captured via Project ID#30801 and the BCL is captured via Project ID#183. The BCL was collateralized with (a) net revenue from a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between Bui Power Authority — an organization with a mandate to plan, execute and manage the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant Project — and the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) for the purchase of the energy to be generated from the Bui hydroelectric power plant, and (b) receivables from Ghana Cocoa Board’s sale of up to 30,000 tons of main crop cocoa and 10,000 tons of light crop cocoa per annum to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing under a 20-year, Cocoa Sales Agreement (CSA); and (c) and a mortgage of the land and building and equipment and machinery of the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant. The cocoa beans were sold at the prevailing market price rather than a fixed price, and the proceeds were to be placed in a Government of Ghana bank account to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). Then, once the dam was operational (and the cocoa agreement came to an end), 85% of the proceeds from sales of energy generated by the Bui hydroelectric power plant were to be placed in an escrow account held by China Eximbank to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). The borrower was expected to maintain a minimum cash balance in the escrow account. The escrow account balance was $27,275,000 in 2018 and $25,582,000 in 2019. The Government of Ghana bank account (for the cash proceeds from COCOBOD’s sale of cocoa to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing) had a balance of $167,816,000 in 2018 and $209,783,000 in 2019. The GCL, by contrast, was not collateralized; it was backed by the full faith and credit of the Government of Ghana. The borrower also purchased a buyer’s credit insurance policy from Sinosure at a cost of $25 million for the BCL (i.e. 8.5% of the face value of the BCL).  According to the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $293,506,062 loan (BCL) and the $330,000,000 loan (GCL) jointly achieved a 81.2% average disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 30 loan disbursements (worth $505,088,349.00) between 2009 and 2012: a $57,786,692.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #1) on May 15, 2009, a $35,217,544.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #2) on February 27, 2009, a $10,896,807.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #3) on October 26, 2009, a $27,469,679.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #4) on December 15, 2009, a $6,865,488.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #5) on January 18, 2010, a $9,390,036.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #6) on February 25, 2010, a $13,754,282.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #7) on May 9, 2010, a $18,208,899.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #8) on July 23, 2010, a $6,755,424.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #9) on July 23, 2010, a $8,919,668.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #10) on August 18, 2010, a $7,321,959.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #11) on September 20, 2010, a $6,563,979.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #12) on December 10, 2010, a $5,515,930.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #13) on December 6, 2010, a $107,904,311.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #14) on December 30, 2010, a $12,367,797.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #15) on February 28, 2011, a $8,689,838.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #16) on March 18, 2011, a $7,321,338.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #17) on April 28, 2011, a $6,870,418.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #18) on June 7, 2011, a $6,957,804.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #19) on July 22, 2011, a $16,330,457.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #20) on September 13, 2011, a $4,248,349.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #21) on October 31, 2011, a $4,071,390.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #22) on November 30, 2011, a $19,056,526.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #23) on December 28, 2011, a $5,071,871.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #24) on April 12, 2012, a $6,955,729.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #25) on April 12, 2012, a $14,889,380.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #26) on May 18, 2012, a $4,807,999.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #27) on June 22, 2012, a $48,355,586.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #28) on July 31, 2012, a $13,242,808.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #29) on October 12, 2012, and a $3,280,361.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #30) on November 30, 2012.  Two additional loans from China Eximbank were negotiated on April 30, 2012 to pay for cost overruns on the dam (the so-called ‘Supplementary Bui Hydroelectric Dam Project’): a $75.4 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) with a maturity of 20 years (final maturity date: April 30, 2032), a 5 year grace period (first repayment date: April 30, 2017), and a 2% interest rate and a $76,206,939 buyer’s credit loan (BCL) with a maturity of 13.5 years (final maturity date: November 21, 2025), a 2 year grace period (first repayment date: April 30, 2014), and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.731% in April 2012) plus a 4% margin. The $75.4 million PBC is captured via Project ID#30086 and the $76,206,939 BCL is captured via Project ID#30709. According to the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $75.4 million PBC and the $76,206,939 BCL jointly achieved a 54.7% average disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 8 loan disbursements (worth $82,949,965.55) between 2014 and 2017: a $18,800,258.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #39) on April 9, 2014, a $8,065,407.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #35) on December 19, 2014, a $1,538,389.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #36) on December 31, 2014, a $3,649,254.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #37) on December 31, 2014, a $6,937,499.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #38) on April 9, 2015, a $14,815,581.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #40) on July 16, 2015, a $12,775,468.25 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #41) on March 11, 2016, and a $16,368,109.30 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #42) on January 25, 2017.  The 2008 GCL's (principal) amount outstanding was $297,615,000 in 2018, $301,237,000 in 2019, GHS 926,830,000 ($165,505,357) in 2020, and GHS 889,400,000 ($171,038,461) in 2021. The 2012 PBC's amount outstanding was $78,582,000 in 2018, $78,583,000 in 2019, GHS 415,680,000 ($74,228,571) in 2020, and GHS 399,990,000 ($76,921,153) in 2021. The 2007 BCL’s amount outstanding was $166,166,000 in 2018, $143,051,000 in 2019, GHS 621,650,000 ($111,008,928) in 2020, and GHS 618,100,000 ($118,865,384) in 2021. The 2012 BCL’s amount outstanding was $41,348,000 in 2018, $37,137,000 in 2019, GHS 269,920,000 ($48,200,000) in 2020, and GHS 274,000,000 ($52,692,307) in 2021.  The 2008 GCL's amount outstanding was $297,615,000 in 2018 and $301,237,000 in 2019. The 2012 PBC's amount outstanding was $78,582,000 in 2018 and $78,583,000 in 2019. The 2007 BCL’s amount outstanding was $166,166,000 in 2018 and $143,051,000 in 2019. The 2012 BCL’s amount outstanding was $41,348,000 in 2018 and $37,137,000 in 2019.  The GCL and PBC were eventually rescheduled such that repayments would commence on July 15, 2023 and end on July 15, 2037, which implies a maturity extension of 8.8 years and a grace period extension of 7.8 years for the GCL and a maturity extension of 5.2 years and a grace period extension of 6.2 years for the PBC. The 2% interest rate that originally applied to both the GCL and PBC also increased to 2.7% as part of the rescheduling. The GCL rescheduling is captured via Project ID#95483. The PBC rescheduling is captured via Project ID#95484.  The Bui Dam Construction Project had six components: (1) a roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) gravity dam incorporating a 5-bay spillway; (2) three penstocks in the middle of the dam; (3) a powerhouse at the toe of the dam on the left bank; (4) two rock fill saddle dams on the right bank; (5) a switchyard; and (6) 276 km of transmission lines; and a permanent bridge downstream of the dam.   Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by Bui Power Authority. The dam was designed by the French engineering firm Coyne et Bellier, which also served as the consulting engineers on the project. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on August 24, 2007. However, construction did not begin until December 2, 2008. Then, on May 3, 2013, the first generator was inaugurated. The dam was inaugurated on December 19, 2013. However, the project was not completed and handed over to the Ghanaian authorities until November 28, 2016.   There are many indications that the China Eximbank loans for the Bui Dam Construction Project have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. First, in August 2017, the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod) — a state-owned company whose export receipts provide an important source of revenue for loan repayment to China Eximbank — told the country’s parliament it was in financial distress due to its loan repayment obligations related to the construction of the Bui Dam. Second, at least two of the four loans were rescheduled. Third, in April 2023, Samuel Kofi Dzamesi, the Chief Executive Officer of BPA revealed that the ECG had accumulated $612 million of payment arrears (overdue payments) to BPA. ECG’s payments to BPA for electricity purchases were originally intended to be the main source of revenue for repaying China Eximbank. Fourth, according to the World Bank’s International Development Statistics, the Government of Ghana had accumulated principal and interest arrears to one or more official sector Chinese creditors worth $908,337,346.70) in 2020 ($763,228,526.60 in principal arrears and $145,108,820.10 in interest arrears). Fifth, on December 19, 2022, the Government of Ghana announced a sovereign default, suspending debt service on its Eurobonds, its commercial loans, and most of its bilateral loans.","1. The precise dates on which the GCL and PBC rescheduling agreements were signed are unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes that each loan was rescheduled on the calendar day when it was originally scheduled to enter its repayment period (September 3, 2015 for the GCL and April 30, 2017 for the PBC). This issue merits further investigation.","# Sector

On September 25, 2007, China Eximbank and the Government of Ghana signed a buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement worth $293,506,062 for the Bui Dam Construction Project. Then, on September 3, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Ghana signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 2.1 billion ($330 million). The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 17.2 year-maturity (final maturity date: November 21, 2025), a 5-year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2013), an interest rate of CIRR plus a margin of 0.75% (6.13%), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity (final maturity date: September 3, 2028), a 7 year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2015), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL is captured via Project ID#30801 and the BCL is captured via Project ID#183. The BCL was collateralized with (a) net revenue from a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between Bui Power Authority — an organization with a mandate to plan, execute and manage the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant Project — and the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) for the purchase of the energy to be generated from the Bui hydroelectric power plant, and (b) receivables from Ghana Cocoa Board’s sale of up to 30,000 tons of main crop cocoa and 10,000 tons of light crop cocoa per annum to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing under a 20-year, Cocoa Sales Agreement (CSA); and (c) and a mortgage of the land and building and equipment and machinery of the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant. The cocoa beans were sold at the prevailing market price rather than a fixed price, and the proceeds were to be placed in a Government of Ghana bank account to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). Then, once the dam was operational (and the cocoa agreement came to an end), 85% of the proceeds from sales of energy generated by the Bui hydroelectric power plant were to be placed in an escrow account held by China Eximbank to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). The borrower was expected to maintain a minimum cash balance in the escrow account. The escrow account balance was $27,275,000 in 2018 and $25,582,000 in 2019. The Government of Ghana bank account (for the cash proceeds from COCOBOD’s sale of cocoa to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing) had a balance of $167,816,000 in 2018 and $209,783,000 in 2019. The GCL, by contrast, was not collateralized; it was backed by the full faith and credit of the Government of Ghana. The borrower also purchased a buyer’s credit insurance policy from Sinosure at a cost of $25 million for the BCL (i.e. 8.5% of the face value of the BCL).  According to the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $293,506,062 loan (BCL) and the $330,000,000 loan (GCL) jointly achieved a 81.2% average disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 30 loan disbursements (worth $505,088,349.00) between 2009 and 2012: a $57,786,692.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #1) on May 15, 2009, a $35,217,544.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #2) on February 27, 2009, a $10,896,807.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #3) on October 26, 2009, a $27,469,679.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #4) on December 15, 2009, a $6,865,488.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #5) on January 18, 2010, a $9,390,036.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #6) on February 25, 2010, a $13,754,282.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #7) on May 9, 2010, a $18,208,899.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #8) on July 23, 2010, a $6,755,424.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #9) on July 23, 2010, a $8,919,668.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #10) on August 18, 2010, a $7,321,959.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #11) on September 20, 2010, a $6,563,979.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #12) on December 10, 2010, a $5,515,930.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #13) on December 6, 2010, a $107,904,311.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #14) on December 30, 2010, a $12,367,797.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #15) on February 28, 2011, a $8,689,838.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #16) on March 18, 2011, a $7,321,338.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #17) on April 28, 2011, a $6,870,418.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #18) on June 7, 2011, a $6,957,804.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #19) on July 22, 2011, a $16,330,457.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #20) on September 13, 2011, a $4,248,349.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #21) on October 31, 2011, a $4,071,390.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #22) on November 30, 2011, a $19,056,526.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #23) on December 28, 2011, a $5,071,871.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #24) on April 12, 2012, a $6,955,729.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #25) on April 12, 2012, a $14,889,380.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #26) on May 18, 2012, a $4,807,999.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #27) on June 22, 2012, a $48,355,586.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #28) on July 31, 2012, a $13,242,808.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #29) on October 12, 2012, and a $3,280,361.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #30) on November 30, 2012.  Two additional loans from China Eximbank were negotiated on April 30, 2012 to pay for cost overruns on the dam (the so-called ‘Supplementary Bui Hydroelectric Dam Project’): a $75.4 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) with a maturity of 20 years (final maturity date: April 30, 2032), a 5 year grace period (first repayment date: April 30, 2017), and a 2% interest rate and a $76,206,939 buyer’s credit loan (BCL) with a maturity of 13.5 years (final maturity date: November 21, 2025), a 2 year grace period (first repayment date: April 30, 2014), and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.731% in April 2012) plus a 4% margin. The $75.4 million PBC is captured via Project ID#30086 and the $76,206,939 BCL is captured via Project ID#30709. According to the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $75.4 million PBC and the $76,206,939 BCL jointly achieved a 54.7% average disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 8 loan disbursements (worth $82,949,965.55) between 2014 and 2017: a $18,800,258.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #39) on April 9, 2014, a $8,065,407.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #35) on December 19, 2014, a $1,538,389.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #36) on December 31, 2014, a $3,649,254.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #37) on December 31, 2014, a $6,937,499.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #38) on April 9, 2015, a $14,815,581.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #40) on July 16, 2015, a $12,775,468.25 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #41) on March 11, 2016, and a $16,368,109.30 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #42) on January 25, 2017.  The 2008 GCL's (principal) amount outstanding was $297,615,000 in 2018, $301,237,000 in 2019, GHS 926,830,000 ($165,505,357) in 2020, and GHS 889,400,000 ($171,038,461) in 2021. The 2012 PBC's amount outstanding was $78,582,000 in 2018, $78,583,000 in 2019, GHS 415,680,000 ($74,228,571) in 2020, and GHS 399,990,000 ($76,921,153) in 2021. The 2007 BCL’s amount outstanding was $166,166,000 in 2018, $143,051,000 in 2019, GHS 621,650,000 ($111,008,928) in 2020, and GHS 618,100,000 ($118,865,384) in 2021. The 2012 BCL’s amount outstanding was $41,348,000 in 2018, $37,137,000 in 2019, GHS 269,920,000 ($48,200,000) in 2020, and GHS 274,000,000 ($52,692,307) in 2021.  The 2008 GCL's amount outstanding was $297,615,000 in 2018 and $301,237,000 in 2019. The 2012 PBC's amount outstanding was $78,582,000 in 2018 and $78,583,000 in 2019. The 2007 BCL’s amount outstanding was $166,166,000 in 2018 and $143,051,000 in 2019. The 2012 BCL’s amount outstanding was $41,348,000 in 2018 and $37,137,000 in 2019.  The GCL and PBC were eventually rescheduled such that repayments would commence on July 15, 2023 and end on July 15, 2037, which implies a maturity extension of 8.8 years and a grace period extension of 7.8 years for the GCL and a maturity extension of 5.2 years and a grace period extension of 6.2 years for the PBC. The 2% interest rate that originally applied to both the GCL and PBC also increased to 2.7% as part of the rescheduling. The GCL rescheduling is captured via Project ID#95483. The PBC rescheduling is captured via Project ID#95484.  The Bui Dam Construction Project had six components: (1) a roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) gravity dam incorporating a 5-bay spillway; (2) three penstocks in the middle of the dam; (3) a powerhouse at the toe of the dam on the left bank; (4) two rock fill saddle dams on the right bank; (5) a switchyard; and (6) 276 km of transmission lines; and a permanent bridge downstream of the dam.   Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by Bui Power Authority. The dam was designed by the French engineering firm Coyne et Bellier, which also served as the consulting engineers on the project. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on August 24, 2007. However, construction did not begin until December 2, 2008. Then, on May 3, 2013, the first generator was inaugurated. The dam was inaugurated on December 19, 2013. However, the project was not completed and handed over to the Ghanaian authorities until November 28, 2016.   There are many indications that the China Eximbank loans for the Bui Dam Construction Project have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. First, in August 2017, the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod) — a state-owned company whose export receipts provide an important source of revenue for loan repayment to China Eximbank — told the country’s parliament it was in financial distress due to its loan repayment obligations related to the construction of the Bui Dam. Second, at least two of the four loans were rescheduled. Third, in April 2023, Samuel Kofi Dzamesi, the Chief Executive Officer of BPA revealed that the ECG had accumulated $612 million of payment arrears (overdue payments) to BPA. ECG’s payments to BPA for electricity purchases were originally intended to be the main source of revenue for repaying China Eximbank. Fourth, according to the World Bank’s International Development Statistics, the Government of Ghana had accumulated principal and interest arrears to one or more official sector Chinese creditors worth $908,337,346.70) in 2020 ($763,228,526.60 in principal arrears and $145,108,820.10 in interest arrears). Fifth, on December 19, 2022, the Government of Ghana announced a sovereign default, suspending debt service on its Eurobonds, its commercial loans, and most of its bilateral loans.

Ltd. for a 100 MW Solar PV Power Plant in Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park. China Eximbank provided two loans: (1) an RMB 100 million loan with a 2.65% interest rate and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#54285) and (2) a $49.06 million loan with a 5.0058% interest rate and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#53989). Bank of Jiangsu Co. Ltd. provided the third loan worth $64.440 million with a 5.0958% interest rate and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#54286).   The borrower purchased credit insurance from Sinosure for both of these loans. The borrower, BGEPL, was expected to use the loan proceeds to partially finance two commercial (EPC) contracts that it signed on June 27, 2015: an offshore supply contract that it signed with China First Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd. and an onshore construction contract that it signed with MCC Ruba International Construction Company (Pvt) Ltd. The $150.269 million project was implemented on a build, own and operate (BOO) basis and financed according to a debt-equity ratio of 81:19. BGEPL achieved financial close on December 28, 2015, which is typically the date of the first loan disbursement.

Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.

The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this “[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’.

[CPEC, IPP] Bank of Jiangsu provides $64.44 million loan for 100 MW Solar PV Power Plant in Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park (Linked to Project ID #50939, #54285, #53989)

# Description
On December 21, 2015, Best Green Energy Pakistan Limited (BGEPL) — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and wholly-owned subsidiary of Zonergy, which is itself a subsidiary of ZTE Corporation — signed three loan agreements with China Eximbank and Bank of Jiangsu Co. Ltd. for a 100 MW Solar PV Power Plant in Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park. China Eximbank provided two loans: (1) an RMB 100 million loan with a 2.65% interest rate and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#54285) and (2) a $49.06 million loan with a 5.0058% interest rate and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#53989). Bank of Jiangsu Co. Ltd. provided the third loan worth $64.440 million with a 5.0958% interest rate and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#54286).   The borrower purchased credit insurance from Sinosure for both of these loans. The borrower, BGEPL, was expected to use the loan proceeds to partially finance two commercial (EPC) contracts that it signed on June 27, 2015: an offshore supply contract that it signed with China First Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd. and an onshore construction contract that it signed with MCC Ruba International Construction Company (Pvt) Ltd. The $150.269 million project was implemented on a build, own and operate (BOO) basis and financed according to a debt-equity ratio of 81:19. BGEPL achieved financial close on December 28, 2015, which is typically the date of the first loan disbursement.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 100 MW Solar PV Power Plant located in Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park at Lal Sohanra in Cholistan, within Bahawalpur District in the Province of Punjab.
