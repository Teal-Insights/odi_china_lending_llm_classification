54286,ENERGY,"[CPEC, IPP] Bank of Jiangsu provides $64.44 million loan for 100 MW Solar PV Power Plant in Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park (Linked to Project ID #50939, #54285, #53989)","On December 21, 2015, Best Green Energy Pakistan Limited (BGEPL) — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and wholly-owned subsidiary of Zonergy, which is itself a subsidiary of ZTE Corporation — signed three loan agreements with China Eximbank and Bank of Jiangsu Co. Ltd. for a 100 MW Solar PV Power Plant in Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park. China Eximbank provided two loans: (1) an RMB 100 million loan with a 2.65% interest rate and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#54285) and (2) a $49.06 million loan with a 5.0058% interest rate and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#53989). Bank of Jiangsu Co. Ltd. provided the third loan worth $64.440 million with a 5.0958% interest rate and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#54286).   The borrower purchased credit insurance from Sinosure for both of these loans. The borrower, BGEPL, was expected to use the loan proceeds to partially finance two commercial (EPC) contracts that it signed on June 27, 2015: an offshore supply contract that it signed with China First Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd. and an onshore construction contract that it signed with MCC Ruba International Construction Company (Pvt) Ltd. The $150.269 million project was implemented on a build, own and operate (BOO) basis and financed according to a debt-equity ratio of 81:19. BGEPL achieved financial close on December 28, 2015, which is typically the date of the first loan disbursement.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 100 MW Solar PV Power Plant located in Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park at Lal Sohanra in Cholistan, within Bahawalpur District in the Province of Punjab. China First Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd and MCC Ruba International Construction Company (Pvt) Ltd were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. The project reached its commercial operations date (COD) on July 31, 2016.   However, this project has encountered debt repayment and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. In May 2022, reports emerged that the Government of Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to Zonergy and its subsidiaries/SPVs. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 10.4 billion (approximately $52 million). Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this “[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).","1. According to multiple, official sources, the Government of Pakistan has issued sovereign guarantees in support of all loans issued by Chinese state-owned banks for independent power projects (IPPs) in Pakistan (see https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cepk/chn/zbgx/t1735166.htm and http://pk.chineseembassy.org/eng/zbgx/202110/t20211010_9558510.htm and https://www.dropbox.com/s/bmx3w2b38o7guxm/Debt%20Pricing%20of%20IPPs%20%28002%29.pdf?dl=0). As such, AidData assumes that the loan captured in this record is backed by a sovereign guarantee from the Government of Pakistan. 2. On November 8, 2014, the Chinese Government and the Government of Pakistan signed a CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement. According to Article 5 of the Agreement, ‘the Pakistani Party agrees that a revolving account shall be opened with 30 days of commercial operation of the respective project, into which the money, no less than the 22 per cent of the monthly payments for the respective power project under the agreement shall be deposited to provide cover for the shortfall in power bill recoveries from the date of power generation of the said projects agreements subject to the condition that the additional direct and indirect expenses incurred in maintaining the revolving account would be compensated by the producers through a discount arrangement to be mutually agreed.’ Subsequently, the Finance Division, in consultation with the Power Division, finalized a mechanism for the Revolving Account (RA) with the approval of The Minister of Finance in a letter dated June 22, 2015. Then, in September 2017, the Power Division forwarded a draft Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) to be signed between Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guaranteed (CPPA-G) and power producer(s) to the Finance Division. CPPA-G subsequently executed the finalized draft of RAA with multiple CPEC IPPs. The Government of Pakistan also guaranteed the funding obligations of the CPPA with respect to the RAA, through Supplemental Implementation Agreements signed between the Government of Pakistan — through the Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) — and the respective IPPs. 3.
