60747,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides RMB 810 million government concessional loan for Port Gentil-Omboué Road and Bridge Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#73174),"On September 9, 2013, the Government of Gabon and China Eximbank signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 810 million (or approximately $121 million) for the Port Gentil-Omboue Road and Booué Bridge Construction Project. This loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. In 2013, the Government of Gabon and China Eximbank also signed a USD-denominated preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the Port Gentil-Omboué Road and Ogooué River Booué Bridge Construction Project.  The face value of the PBC was approximately 254.4 billion CFA francs, or approximately $534,582,600. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. The proceeds from the GCL and the PBC were used to finance a $663 million EPC contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC). Approximately 95% of the cost of this project was financed by China Eximbank while the remaining 5% was financed by the Government of Gabon itself.  The GCL that supported this project is captured in Project ID#60747. The PBC that supported this project is captured in Project ID#73174.   The project involved the construction of a 93.26 km two-way, two-lane highway from Port Gentil to Omboué (with an asphalt concrete surface, a subgrade width of 12 meters, and a subgrade width of 10 meters), the construction of three bridges (the 4707 meter Ogooué River Bridge, the 367 meter Booué Bridge, and the 4577 meter Nkomi Laguna Bridge) measuring 13 km in length, and the construction of 141 culverts.   CRBC was the contractor responsible for project implementation. It received an order to commence construction on March 20, 2014. Then, a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 3, 2014. The project was handed over on December 23, 2020.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loans for the Port Gentil-Omboue Road and Bridge Construction Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In mid-2014, a decline in international oil prices generated sharp reductions in Gabon’s oil exports and fiscal revenues. The country’s rising fiscal deficit led to the accumulation of arrears to external creditors. By 2017, the stock of the Government of Gabon’s external arrears stood at $115 million, including arrears to China, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Israel, and South Korea. All of these arrears were successfully cleared by 2020. However, the Government of Gabon accumulated $3 million of additional arrears to Chinese creditors in 2020.  By the end of May 2021, ‘the stock of [the Government of] Gabon’s external arrears stood at CFAF 98.03 billion (US$182.1 million), including CFAF 23.8 billion (US$44.2 million) vis-à-vis multilaterals and CFAF 21.05 billion (US$39.1 million) vis-à-vis government agencies and private creditors insured with companies from Paris Club member countries and from China [ICBC and China Construction Bank] CFAF 1.3 billion (US$2.42 million). The Government's strategy for the clearance of existing external arrears consists of focusing primarily on multilateral debt, bilateral debt, insured commercial commitments and seeking agreements with other creditors prior to the IMF Board meeting. Accordingly, we will clear the arrears vis-à-vis the multilaterals. We will also clear bilateral and commercial-insured arrears as follows: (i) Austria CFAF 6.83 billion (US$12.69 million); (ii) France CFAF 11.9 billion (US$22.11 million); (iii) Israel CFAF 2.23 billion (US$4.13 million); and Spain CFAF 0.09 billion (US$0.17 million). Regarding the other commercial arrears vis-à-cis AFREXIMBANK (CFAF 7.52 billion or US$13.97 million, and commercial non-insured vis-à-vis France CFAF 0.7 billion (US$1.24 million), Austria CFAF 8.71 billion (US$16.18 million), and Morocco CFAF 1.01 billion (US$1.87 million), we contacted these creditors individually to obtain from them the non-objection agreement. The same communication was made with China to which our bilateral payment arrears are about CFAF 34.01 billion (US$63.17 million).’ Then, in 2022, the IMF reported that the Government of Gabon’s external arrears to Chinese creditors stood at $23.9 million as of December 2021 and $1 million in June 2022.","1. This project is also known as the Port Gentil-Omboué Road and Ogooué River Booué Bridge Construction Project, the PO Project, and the Libreville-Port-Gentil Road Project. The French project title is Port-Gentil-Omboué et du Pont sur l’Ogooué à Booué or the Route POG Omboué. The Chinese project title is 加蓬 让蒂尔港-翁布韦段公路 or 让蒂尔港-翁布埃沿海路及博韦大桥项目.2.  In the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020, it only identifies a single (concessional) loan for this project worth $134 million. However, the Government of Gabon, the Chinese Government and CRBC all report that China Eximbank covered approximately 95% of this $663 million project with a government concessional loan and a preferential buyer’s credit. Therefore, AidData records both of these loans.   3. Some sources indicate that this project also supported the construction of a 243 km road from Omboué to Yombi. However, these appear to be references to a second phase of the project.  The extension from Omboué to Yombi will eventually allow this road to link up with the Nationale No. 1, Gabon’s main road from Libreville to the south of the country (Lambaréné, Ndendé) and Congo-Brazzaville.","# Sector

VEB then on-lent the proceeds of the loan to LLC SSK Zvezda (a special purpose vehicle owned by PJSC NK Rosneft). The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown.  The purpose of the project is to facilitate the construction and acquisition of a fleet of 15 icebreaking liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers for LLC SSK Zvezda. The Arc7 ice-class LNG tanker fleet will form the core of the Arctic fleet for transportation of LNG from Novatek’s Arctic LNG 2 project (in Gydan Peninsula within northern Siberia) and ensure year-round navigation along the Northern Sea Route including its Eastern part throughout the year. The vessels, which are designed to navigate the complicated ice conditions of the Northern Sea Route, will supply LNG to the Asian Pacific region and boost the development of the Russian shipbuilding industry. These tankers will have increased icebreaking and maneuvering characteristics than the existing fleet used by Novatek’s Yamal LNG project. The carriers will be registered under the Russian Federation and operated by the Russian crew. The new fleet of 15 Arc7 ice-class tankers will be owned and operated by SMART LNG LLC (a joint venture between Novatek and Sovcomflot) and Arctic LNG 2 LLC (a subsidiary of Novatek). The tankers will be used for long-term time charter (lease) contracts between Sovcomflot Group, SMART LNG LLC, and Arctic LNG 2 LLC.  On December 17, 2019, VEB disbursed the first, $66 million loan tranche to LLC SSK Zvezda. A steel cutting ceremony for the lead (pilot) Arc7 ice-class LNG vessel was held in November 2020.

(2012) 10TOTAL NO.(198) 1420303052012210261] for Phase 1 of the Yaounde-Douala Highway Project.  The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.30% commitment fee, and a 0.30% management fee. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan (PBC) to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $568,000,000 commercial (EPC) contract between Cameroon’s Ministry of Public Works of the Republic of Cameroon and China First Highway Engineering Co. Ltd. (CFHEC), which was signed on August 8, 2011.   As of December 31, 2020, the loan had achieved a 73.2% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 69.4 billion). The loan’s amount outstanding was equivalent to CFA 188.1 billion as of December 31, 2020.   The purpose of the Yaounde-Douala highway project is to facilitate the construction of a 215 km road linking Douala on the western coast with capital Yaounde. Phase 1 will involve construction of a 68.3 km long road, which will run from Yaoundé to Bot Makak/Bibodi. The six-lane highway will be the first new motorway since the country's independence. The project seeks to replace the existing hazardous two-lane highway, and it aims to boost domestic and sub-regional trade as well as shorten the distance between Douala and Yaounde from 265 km to 215 km.   CFHEC was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Phase 1 construction activities began on April 15, 2014, and the originally expected project completion date was October 13, 2018; however, by April 29, 2014, there was reportedly a protracted conflict between China First Highway Engineering Co. Ltd. (CFHEC) and the Control Mission led by the SCET-Tunisie/Louis Berger. Project implementation was delayed by unpaid indemnity owed to those living along the first 10 km of highway. The Cameroonian authorities also reportedly made modifications to the specifications of the project by increasing the speed limit from 100 km/hour to 110 km/hour and adding extra lanes, leading the EPC contractor to assert that according to the budget only 47 km of the road could be constructed under such conditions. By January 2015, construction had recommenced, as reported by the China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) who noted that tree felling had taken place along 40 km of the road’s route and that earthworks had started not long before. Then, in 2017, delays in payment to the contractor led to a one month suspension of construction beginning on May 2, 2017 and concluding in June 2017 after settlements were paid.  As of May 2019, Phase 1 had achieved a 74% completion rate. As of February 2020, the project had achieved a 80% completion rate and 6 of 36 engineering structures were not yet finished. In April 2020, the company in charge of supervising the works, SCET-TUNISIE, reported that the project was scheduled to reach completion by December 2020 in spite of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of August 2021, the project had achieved a 98% completion rate.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the Yaounde-Douala Highway Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress.

He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding.

This project is also known as the Poly-GCL Oil and Gas Project, the Ethiopia-Djibouti Oil & Gas Project, the Ethiopia-Djibouti Natural Gas Project, and the Ogaden–Djibouti Pipeline Construction Project.

POLY-GCL Petroleum Group Holdings Limited [保利协鑫石油天然气集团控股有限公司 or 协鑫（集团）控股有限公司] was legally incorporated on November 7, 2012.

However, most sources identify POLY-GCL Petroleum Group Holdings Limited as a joint venture of China Poly Group Corporation and Golden Concord Group Limited (GCL).4. According to a letter issued by Ethiopia’s Office of the Prime Minister on June 5, 2019, Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed lifted restrictions imposed by the National Bank of Ethiopia compelling international oil and gas companies to hold a local foreign currency account. The condition was the major hurdle that restricted the country from getting foreign direct investments in the oil and mining sector, according to Samuel Urkato (PhD), minister of Mines & Petroleum. 'Many companies that want to invest in the country have backed off due to this restraint,' Samuel told Fortune. The new decision was passed after having a serious debate with the officials of the National Bank of Ethiopia,” Samuel said. The companies were also frustrated by the directive, which limited them from obtaining loans from international creditors. “Since international creditors require the forex account of borrowers as a requirement for loan approval, the companies, especially Poly-GCL, have been continuously calling for the reversal of the directive,' said Samuel. Poly GCL, which discovered crude oil reserves in three wells in the Hilala region and launched test production in June 2018, has been filing complaint letters with the government for the past two years. The companies have been transferring foreign currency into their local accounts to finance their oil and gas exploration activities and withdrawing cash in local currency for their expenditures.","# Sector
