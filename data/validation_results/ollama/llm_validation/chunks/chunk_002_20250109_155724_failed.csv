Then, on September 6, 2018, Liu-Yan, President of China National Complete Plant Import Export Corporation (COMPLANT) and Ally Coulibaly, Cote d’Ivoire’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, signed a protocol to mobilize CFA 262 billion (EUR 399.4 million or USD 473.4 million) for the Ferkessédougou Dry Port Construction Project. On January 30, 2020, ICBC and the Government of Cote d’Ivoire signed a loan agreement worth CFA 254,171,513,219.12 Ferkessédougou Dry Port Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the loan is backed by a Sinosure credit insurance policy.

According to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the ICBC had not disbursed as of December 31, 2022.  The project is divided into two ‘lots’. Lot 1 involves site remediation and development activities as well as the construction of a (multimodal) logistics platform — with warehouses, cold chain equipment, etc. — and hydrocarbon depot. Lot 2 involves the construction of a slaughterhouse, a cattle market, and an industrial zone for the development and processing of agricultural and mining products. The project site is spread over an area of ​​3185 hectares and located in the village of Dékovogo, approximately 5 km from the capital of Tchologo and near the northern city of Ferkessédougou. Upon completion, the dry port of Ferkessédougou is expected to relieve congestion and bring the autonomous port of Abidjan closer to its regional partners such as Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. It is also expected to make a lasting contribution to the development of the northern regions of the country and to the enhancement of the economic potential of the Poro, Tchologo, and Bagoué regions in Savanes District, and Bounkani, and Gontougo regions in Zanzan district. The project is also expected to generate more than 71,000 direct jobs that will directly benefit young men and women.  Lot 2 is being financed and implemented on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis. Lot 1, which is spread over an area of 732 hectares, is not. COMPLANT is the contractor responsible for the implementation of Lot 1.  A foundation-laying ceremony took place on May 21, 2021.

Then, in June 2022, the Government of Cote d’Ivoire partially met its counterpart financing commitment (by providing 68.4% of the required amount: CFA 26 billion out of CFA 38 billion).

57087,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides $337.6 million preferential buyer’s credit for Ndola International Airport Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#57092),"In November 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Zambia signed a $337,621,439.90 preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement for the Ndola International Airport Construction Project (captured via Project ID#57087). The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. Then, in 2017, ICBC and the Government of Zambia signed a $59.58 million loan agreement for the Ndola International Airport Construction Project (captured via Project ID#57092). The borrowing terms of the ICBC loan are unknown. The proceeds of the China Eximbank PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $397,201,694 commercial (EPC) contract between Zambia Airports Corporation Limited (ZACL) and AVIC International Holding Corporation, which was signed on September 11, 2013 and amended on August 25, 2014. The proceeds of the ICBC loan were to be used by the borrower to finance 15% of the cost of the $397,201,694 commercial (EPC) contract between Zambia Airports Corporation Limited (ZACL) and AVIC International Holding Corporation. As of July 2022, the China Eximbank loan had achieved a 57.1% disbursement rate ($192,785,140.88 out of $337,621,439.90).   The project involved the construction of a 12,000 square meter terminal building, 3 aero bridges, a 3.5 kilometer runway, a cargo terminal, a 50-room hotel, a new fire and rescue station, a cargo terminal, an aircraft maintenance hangar, and a fuel farm. AVIC International Holding Corporation was the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. It reportedly fulfilled the government policy of having 20 percent sub-contracting to local contractors by engaging 60 local sub-contractors. 2,700 people were employed during the project construction period.   A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on June 25, 2017. However, the construction site was not handed over to the EPC contractor until September 28, 2017. The EPC contract went into effect and construction began on October 26, 2017. By December 17, 2019, the overall project had achieved a 58% completion rate; the passenger terminal completion rate was 61%, the business complex completion rate was 49%, the air traffic control building completion rate was 54%, the runway, taxiway and apron completion rate was 98%, and the viaduct completion rate was 80%. As of March 2020, the project had achieved an overall completion rate of 60%. As of April 2021, the project had achieved an overall completion rate of 88.9%. The project was originally expected to reach completion on October 20, 2020. However, due to implementation delays related to financing problems and the COVID-19 pandemic, the intended project completion date was pushed out to January 31, 2022. The airport was officially commissioned on August 5, 2021, but the airport was still reportedly waiting for operational certifications at that time. This project has also been plagued by financial problems due to overdue contractor payments. According to Clause 43.1 of the commercial contract between AVIC International Holding Corporation and ZACL, if the client (ZACL) failed to make payment within a stipulated period of time, the EPC contractor (AVIC International Holding Corporation) was entitled to the payment of interest for the late payment, which was to be calculated from the date by which the payment should have been made until the date on which payment was made by applying the interest rate as per local practice. If the payment was delayed for more than 56 days, the EPC contractor would have the right to suspend the works or terminate the commercial contract. Contrary to the clause, AVIC International Holding Corporation had not been paid a total of $97,324,668 being outstanding interim payment certificates (IPCs) for a period of more than fourteen months. In addition, there was no documentation availed to the Auditor General of Zambia to indicate why, despite the financing agreement being in force, the lender had not paid the contractor.   On April 5, 2021, AVIC International Holding Corporation claimed interest on late payments on outstanding IPCs in amounts totaling $1,913,155. AVIC International Senior Consultant, Lei Yingqi, later confirmed that AVIC International Holding Corporation as an EPC contractor was using borrowed funds at high interest rates to ensure that the project continued to progress and the employees continued to be paid. He also indicated that ‘support from abroad was cut off or delayed’, which suggests that the source of the borrowed funds was not China Eximbank or ICBC. Then, on July 29, 2022, the Ministry of Finance & National Planning (MOFNP) of Zambia announced that it was seeking lender approval to formally cancel the China Eximbank loan’s undisbursed balance ($144,836,299.02); however, it also noted that it had not yet secured formal lender approval for this action. This announcement came approximately 21 months after the Government of Zambia defaulted on its repayment obligations to Eurobond holders and approximately 6 weeks after China, France, and 14 other countries formed a creditor committee to discuss the Zambian authorities’ request for a debt treatment under ‘the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the DSSI’ endorsed by the G20 and the Paris Club. MOFNP also announced on July 29, 2022 that it planned to finance the completion of the Ndola International Airport Construction Project with general government revenues, and it signaled its intention to rescope the project to focus on the ‘selected works’ (i.e. access road and completion of the fuel farm).","1.

The Chinese project title is 赞比亚铜带国际机场建项目 or 铜带国际机场建 设项目. 2. On August 25, 2014, the price of the commercial contract between ZACL and AVIC International Holding Corporation was adjusted downwards by $177,566,352 from $574,768,046 to $397,201,694 through Addendum No. 1, which reduced the size of the airport from 22,250 square meters with a capacity of two million passengers per annum to 12,000 square meters with a capacity of one million passengers per annum among others. However, Addendum No. 1 revealed that although some original quantities were maintained as in the original contract, the prices were adjusted upwards. As of April 30, 2021, AVIC International Holding Corporation had been paid $252,365,334.88 — or 63.54% of the commercial contract price (leaving a balance of $144,836,359). 3. Before August 2021, the Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe International Airport was at an old location, in the Itawa suburb of Ndola (south-east of the city centre). Previously, it was known as Ndola Airport and in September 2011, President Michael Sata decided to rename the airport in honor of Simon Kapwepwe, the nation's former vice-president.  In late 2021, Ndola's airport was officially moved from Itawa to a new address, 15 kilometers west of the city centre, just north of the Dag Hammarskjöld Crash Site Memorial, which is its current address. The airport's current location, while under construction, was known as the Copperbelt International Airport until late 2021, when it became the official airport of Ndola. As such, the name for Ndola's Airport (Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe International Airport) became the name for the newly built airport. Ndola retained the name it was given by President Michael Sata in 2011 to refer to its international airport (the name Copperbelt International Airport was no-longer in use). This new airport also retained the same IATA code (NLA).","# Sector

Then, in November 2012, an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (EIA) was issued for the project. A Letter of Support (LOS) for the project was issued by PPIB on June 30, 2016. Then, on December 14, 2016, a bidding consortium (joint venture) consisting of China Gezhouba Group Company Limited and China Gezhouba Group International Engineering Co. Ltd was identified as providing the most advantageous bid for the Azad Pattan Hydropower Plant Construction Project. An award was made to this bidding consortium on December 27, 2016. Approximately six months later, on June 11, 2017, the Government of Pakistan, China Gezhouba Group Company Limited, and China Gezhouba Group International Engineering Co. Ltd signed a commercial (EPC) contract for the Azad Pattan Hydropower Plant Construction Project. The EPC contract was structured as an onshore civil works contract and an offshore supply contract covering imported M&E plant and equipment for permanent installation in the power generating complex. It included provisions for adjusting the contract price for changes in costs for cement, fuel, steel reinforcement and labour due to variation in applicable prices/indices published by Pakistan Bureau of Statistics from the specified base date (November 2016) through construction to commercial operations date (COD).  On June 23, 2017, Azad Pattan Power (Private) Limited — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of China Gezhouba Group Company Limited (80% ownership stake) and Laraib Group (20%) ownership stake — submitted a tariff proposal to the Government of Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) for the Azad Pattan Hydropower Plant Construction Project. At that time, the estimated cost of the project was $1,516,170,000 and it was expected to be financed according to a 75:25 debt:equity ratio. China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd. (CGGC) agreed to partially finance the equity portion equal to $379.04 million (as captured via Project ID#54233). At the time that the tariff proposal was submitted to NEPRA, Azad Pattan Power (Private) Limited expected that a consortium of Chinese state-owned banks — consisting of China Development Bank (CDB), China Construction Bank (CCB), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and Bank of China (BOC) — would provide a $1,137,130,000 syndicated overseas investment loan in support of the project. The proposed borrowing terms included an 18-year maturity, a 6-year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.3% to 4.2%, a 0.8% commitment fee, and a 1% management fee. Repayments would be made in 24 equal semi-annual installments (over 12 years). Sinosure was also expected to provide overseas investment loan insurance for this project. Then, on November 10, 2017, a grid interconnection study for the project was approved by NTDC. A Panel of Experts (POE) constituted by PPIB approved an optimized design of the project with installed capacity of 700.7 MW on December 6, 2017. The project secured approvals from the relevant Environmental Protection Agencies (EPAs) in March 2018. The EPC stage tariff was determined by NEPRA on May 17, 2018 and amended through a review determination on October 11, 2018. On July 6, 2020, China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd. (CGGC) and the Government of Pakistan signed 30-year concession (‘project implementation’) agreement and agreed to implement the project on a Build, Own, Operate, Transfer (BOOT) basis. At the end of a 30-year concession period, the project owner (Azad Pattan Power Private Limited) will handed over the power plant to the Government of Pakistan. Azad Pattan Power Private Limited also signed a Water Use Agreement with the Government of Punjab and a Tripartite Power Purchase Agreement on July 6, 2020. Then, on December 1, 2020, Azad Pattan Power (Private) Limited and Government of Azad Jammu & Kashmir signed the GoAJ&K Implementation Agreement (GoAJ&K IA) and GoAJ&K Water Use Agreement (GoAJ&K WUA). A Term Sheet defining key terms and conditions agreed between Azad Pattan Power (Private) Limited (borrower) and the consortium of Chinese state-owned banks was executed on January 5, 2021.  Roughly one year later, on December 31, 2021, Azad Pattan Power (Private) Limited signed a $1.540 billion syndicated loan agreement (‘finance facility agreement’) with China Development Bank (Project ID#54234), China Construction Bank (Project ID#92636), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Project ID#92635), and Bank of China (Project ID#92637). At that time, the project was expected to achieve a ‘financial close’ and start construction on December 31, 2022. Construction was expected to last 69 months (October 1, 2028). In January 2022, reports emerged that Sinosure was reluctant to issue a credit insurance policy to the borrower (due to rising circular debt and the generally negative outlook for Pakistan’s power sector), which threatened to delay the achievement of financial close.  The purpose of the project is to construct a 700.7 MW hydroelectric power plant that is located about 90 km from Islamabad located on River Jhelum comprising (from upstream to downstream) Chakoti Hattian, Kohala, Mahl, Azad Pattan and Karot. Once commissioned, the power plant is expected to generate about 3.3 billion units of clean energy every year.","1. The Chinese project title is 巴基斯坦阿扎德帕坦水电站项目 or 帕坦投资项目 or 阿扎德帕坦水电站BOOT项目.2. Project ID#54234 captures the debt financing and Project ID#54233 captures the equity financing for the project.3. According to multiple, official sources, the Government of Pakistan has issued sovereign guarantees in support of all loans issued by Chinese state-owned banks for independent power projects (IPPs) in Pakistan (see https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cepk/chn/zbgx/t1735166.htm and http://pk.chineseembassy.org/eng/zbgx/202110/t20211010_9558510.htm and https://www.dropbox.com/s/bmx3w2b38o7guxm/Debt%20Pricing%20of%20IPPs%20%28002%29.pdf?dl=0). As such, AidData assumes that the loan captured in this record is backed by a sovereign guarantee from the Government of Pakistan.4. In December 2019, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Energy Joint Working Group decided to include the 700.7 MW Azad Pattan Hydropower Plant Construction Project in their list of energy projects. 5. AidData has estimated the borrowing terms of the loan based upon the indicative terms that were recorded in the June 23, 2017 tariff proposal to NEPRA. The 6-year grace period was estimated by taking the difference between the expected maturity (18 years) and the expected duration of the repayment period (12 years). The all-in interest rate was estimated by adding 2.75% (the midpoint between 1.3% and 4.2%) to the average 6-month LIBOR rate in December 2021 (0.306%). 6. Several sources refer to a security agreement. Therefore, AidData assumes that this loan is collateralized for the time being. This issue warrants further investigation.5. The size of the contributions from CDB, ICBC, PBC, and CCB are unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes that CDB, ICBC, PBC, and CCB each contributed $385 million (i.e. equally sized contributions to the lending syndicate).","# Sector

At that time, the estimated cost of the project was $1,516,170,000 and it was expected to be financed according to a 75:25 debt:equity ratio. China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd. (CGGC) agreed to partially finance the equity portion equal to $379.04 million (as captured via Project ID#54233). At the time that the tariff proposal was submitted to NEPRA, Azad Pattan Power (Private) Limited expected that a consortium of Chinese state-owned banks — consisting of China Development Bank (CDB), China Construction Bank (CCB), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and Bank of China (BOC) — would provide a $1,137,130,000 syndicated overseas investment loan in support of the project. The proposed borrowing terms included an 18-year maturity, a 6-year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.3% to 4.2%, a 0.8% commitment fee, and a 1% management fee. Repayments would be made in 24 equal semi-annual installments (over 12 years). Sinosure was also expected to provide overseas investment loan insurance for this project. Then, on November 10, 2017, a grid interconnection study for the project was approved by NTDC. A Panel of Experts (POE) constituted by PPIB approved an optimized design of the project with installed capacity of 700.7 MW on December 6, 2017. The project secured approvals from the relevant Environmental Protection Agencies (EPAs) in March 2018. The EPC stage tariff was determined by NEPRA on May 17, 2018 and amended through a review determination on October 11, 2018. On July 6, 2020, China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd. (CGGC) and the Government of Pakistan signed 30-year concession (‘project implementation’) agreement and agreed to implement the project on a Build, Own, Operate, Transfer (BOOT) basis. At the end of a 30-year concession period, the project owner (Azad Pattan Power Private Limited) will handed over the power plant to the Government of Pakistan. Azad Pattan Power Private Limited also signed a Water Use Agreement with the Government of Punjab and a Tripartite Power Purchase Agreement on July 6, 2020. Then, on December 1, 2020, Azad Pattan Power (Private) Limited and Government of Azad Jammu & Kashmir signed the GoAJ&K Implementation Agreement (GoAJ&K IA) and GoAJ&K Water Use Agreement (GoAJ&K WUA). A Term Sheet defining key terms and conditions agreed between Azad Pattan Power (Private) Limited (borrower) and the consortium of Chinese state-owned banks was executed on January 5, 2021.  Roughly one year later, on December 31, 2021, Azad Pattan Power (Private) Limited signed a $1.540 billion syndicated loan agreement (‘finance facility agreement’) with China Development Bank (Project ID#54234), China Construction Bank (Project ID#92636), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Project ID#92635), and Bank of China (Project ID#92637). At that time, the project was expected to achieve a ‘financial close’ and start construction on December 31, 2022. Construction was expected to last 69 months (October 1, 2028). In January 2022, reports emerged that Sinosure was reluctant to issue a credit insurance policy to the borrower (due to rising circular debt and the generally negative outlook for Pakistan’s power sector), which threatened to delay the achievement of financial close.  The purpose of the project is to construct a 700.7 MW hydroelectric power plant that is located about 90 km from Islamabad located on River Jhelum comprising (from upstream to downstream) Chakoti Hattian, Kohala, Mahl, Azad Pattan and Karot. Once commissioned, the power plant is expected to generate about 3.3 billion units of clean energy every year.

According to multiple, official sources, the Government of Pakistan has issued sovereign guarantees in support of all loans issued by Chinese state-owned banks for independent power projects (IPPs) in Pakistan (see https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cepk/chn/zbgx/t1735166.htm and http://pk.chineseembassy.org/eng/zbgx/202110/t20211010_9558510.htm and https://www.dropbox.com/s/bmx3w2b38o7guxm/Debt%20Pricing%20of%20IPPs%20%28002%29.pdf?dl=0). As such, AidData assumes that the loan captured in this record is backed by a sovereign guarantee from the Government of Pakistan.4. In December 2019, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Energy Joint Working Group decided to include the 700.7 MW Azad Pattan Hydropower Plant Construction Project in their list of energy projects. 5. AidData has estimated the borrowing terms of the loan based upon the indicative terms that were recorded in the June 23, 2017 tariff proposal to NEPRA. The 6-year grace period was estimated by taking the difference between the expected maturity (18 years) and the expected duration of the repayment period (12 years). The all-in interest rate was estimated by adding 2.75% (the midpoint between 1.3% and 4.2%) to the average 6-month LIBOR rate in December 2021 (0.306%). 6. Several sources refer to a security agreement. Therefore, AidData assumes that this loan is collateralized for the time being. This issue warrants further investigation.5. The size of the contributions from CDB, ICBC, PBC, and CCB are unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes that CDB, ICBC, PBC, and CCB each contributed $385 million (i.e. equally sized contributions to the lending syndicate).",FALSE,"Error in `httr2::req_perform()` at tidyverse-ellmer-3ad1fff/R/httr2.R:106:3:
