89473,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,"Sinohydro provides $46.8 million — via deferred payment agreement — for Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads (Phase 1, Lot 7) Project (Linked to Project ID#60154)","On May 16, 2018, the Government of Ghana signed a master project support agreement (MPSA) with Sinohydro Corporation Limited (‘Sinohydro’) for an amount of up to $2 billion for the construction of priority infrastructure projects. The MPSA was then approved by Ghana’s Parliament on July 28, 2018. All borrowings that take place under the MPSA carry a maturity of 15 years, a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.80% margin, a 2% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.70% management fee, a 0.50% commitment fee, and a lump sum Sinosure insurance premium of 7%. Loan repayments will be made with the proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite (after the Government of Ghana establishes a bauxite processing plant), with repayments starting approximately three years after the effective date of the agreement. The proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite will be placed in an offshore escrow account by the offtaker for the benefit of Ghana Integrated Aluminium Development Corporation (GIADC) and Sinohydro.    If the value of bauxite decreases, or if bauxite reserves are lower than expected, the Government of Ghana may have to deliver higher volumes of bauxite than anticipated or find alternative means of repayment. While the Government of Ghana does not currently treat borrowings (via deferred payment agreements or DPAs) under the Sinohydro MPSA as external debt, depending on various factors and events and as a result of the deferred payment structure, they could in the future become repayment obligations of the Government of Ghana. The agreement structure seeks to ensure that the obligations of GIADC (the obligor) will not add to the Government of Ghana’s debt stock. If GIADC fails to comply with its collateral or repayment obligations, Sinohydro is entitled to prepayment of outstanding loan balances and may seize the full balance of the escrow account.   Sinohydro, which is itself borrowing from China Construction Bank to finance infrastructure projects under the MPSA, decided to approve funding for infrastructure projects under the MPSA in phases. The first phase consists of 10 road projects (underpinned by 10 EPC contracts) that are collectively worth $646,637,879.74: Accra Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 1 Project), Kumasi Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 2 Project), Tamale Interchange Project (or Phase 1, Lot 3 Project), PTC Interchange Takoradi Project (or Phase 1, Lot 4 Project and the PTC Roundabout Interchange Project, Takoradi), Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway Project (or Phase 1, Lot 5 Project and the Construction of 14 km Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway Project), Sunyani Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 6 Project), Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 7 Project), Upgrading of Selected Feeder Roads in Ashanti and Western Region Project (or Phase 1, Lot 8 Project, Rehabilitation of Oda Ofoase-Abirem Road Project (or Phase 1, Lot 9 Project and 38 km Rehabilitation of New Abirem-Afoasekuma-Akim Oda Road project), and Hohoe-Jasikan-Dodi Pepesu Road Project (or Phase 1, Lot 10 Project and 56.40 km Construction of Hohoe-Jasikan-Dodo Pepesu Road Project).    Each of these projects is being financed through a separate DPA. Under the terms of the MPSA, 'deferred payments' refer to payments due to Sinohydro under a given EPC contract to be made by Ghana's Ministry of Finance using the proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite that have been deferred up to the repayment dates stipulated in the repayment schedules of the DPAs. The DPA for the Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads (Phase 1, Lot 7) Project was signed by Ghana’s Ministry of Roads and Highways, Ghana’s Ministry of Finance, and Sinohydro on September 1, 2018. Under this DPA, which is captured via Project ID#89473, Sinohydro provided $46,852,015.86 of financing to cover 85% of the total cost of the EPC contract ($35,817,641.64) plus the cost of accrued interest and fees during the 30-month construction period.    The scope of the Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads (Phase 1, Lot 7) Project covers construction of the roads in the Western Region and Central Region (specifically, Cape Coast and Prestea inner city roads). The project, which was originally expected to be completed within a period of 30 months, involves 22 km of Cape Coast roads, 3 km of Akotokyir Area roads, 7 km of Abura New Community Area Roads, 3 km of Polytechnic Area Roads, 3 km of Apawusika Roads and Links, and 10.19 km of Prestea Town Roads.

Each bank reportedly contributed $550 million. The lenders for the project are Akbank, Finansbank, Ziraat Bank, Garanti Bank, Halk Bank, Is Bank, VakıfBank, Yapı ve Kredi Bank, Deutsche Bank, Saudi National Commercial Bank, Bank of China and Siemens Bank. The Turkish lenders (Akbank, Finansbank, Ziraat Bank, Garanti Bank, Halk Bank, Is Bank, VakıfBank, Yapı ve Kredi Bank) provided eight-ninths of the total loan amount ($4.405 billion) equally among themselves, while the four foreign lenders (Deutsche Bank, Saudi National Commercial Bank, Bank of China and Siemens Bank) provided the remaining one-ninth of the total loan amount ($550.66 million).

The Gebze-Orhangazi-Izmir Motorway was a toll motorway project procured by the Turkish General Directorate of Highways under a Build, Operate, and Transfer (BOT) Model and is the largest BOT project in Turkey to date. It involved the construction of a 420 km motorway between Gebze and İzmir with 208 toll booths and a 3000-meter suspension bridge crossing İzmit bay. Upon completion, it was expected that the project would reduce travel times from Istanbul to Izmir from 8-10 hours to 3.5 – 4 hours. The starting point of the motorway is Gebze and it then crosses İzmit bay located between Dilovası and Hersek through a Suspension Bridge measuring 3,000 meters in length. It then extends to Orhangazi and Gemlik and is connected to Bursa Ring Road at the Ovaakça intersection. From the Bursa Ring Road, it continues onward to Balıkesir — starting at the Bursa - Karacabey intersection and continuing through the north of Susurluk. It then continues south from the west of Balıkesir — via the Savaştepe, Soma, Kırkağaç districts — and extends to the west near Turgutlu. It runs in parallel to the İzmir-Uşak state highway and finally connects with the Anadolu Lisesi intersection over the İzmir ring road.  On September 20, 2010, Otoyol Yatırım ve İşletme A.Ş.

The Turkish project title is Gebze-Orhangazi-İzmir (İzmit Körfez Geçişi ve Bağlantı Yolları Dahil) Otoyolu Projesi’nin  or İstanbul – İzmir Otoyolu. Given that four foreign lenders (Deutsche Bank, Saudi National Commercial Bank, Bank of China, and Siemens Bank) provided $550.66 million of total debt financing, AidData assumes for the time being that each of these lenders contributed equal amounts ($137.66 million).
