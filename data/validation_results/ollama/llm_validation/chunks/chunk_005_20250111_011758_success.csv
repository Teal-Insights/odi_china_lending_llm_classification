Although the plant came with a relatively high generation cost (Tk21.70 per kilowatt-hour [kWh] as compared with between Tk6.0 and Tk18 per kWh for other Bangladeshi HFO plants), the project has significant political backing as it is part of Bangladesh’s Power System Master Plan 2010 and will help improve the overall electricity supply to export processing zones that have been established in the north-west of the country.
