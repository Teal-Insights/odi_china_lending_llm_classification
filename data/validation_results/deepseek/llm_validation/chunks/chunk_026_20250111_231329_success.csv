The study will help to determine South Sudan's mining riches and also assist South Sudan in providing mining licenses as it looks at extracting gold and other metals, including copper and iron ore.The geological surveys that were conducted in the 1970s and 1980s suggest that South Sudan may have rich deposits of gold, copper and uranium. However, since those surveys were conducted, South Sudan's mineral resources have remained untapped due to the ongoing civil war. As of December 2019, the president of China Mineral Resources Group Co. Ltd, Wang Pingwei, visited Juba and met the country’s finance minister Salvatore Garang, petroleum minister Awou Chuang and held in-depth discussions and negotiations on the national geological survey project in South Sudan.

However, the ADB did not follow up on the project due to its marginal financial viability and its potentially serious environmental and social impacts, especially on migratory fish stocks and fishing livelihoods. Then, in June 2007, the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy (MIME) of Cambodia granted permission for Electricité du Viet Nam (EVN) to conduct a detailed feasibility study. The study was implemented by a consulting firm, Power Engineering Consulting Joint Stock Company 1 (PECC1), in collaboration and consultation with technical ministries/agencies of the Royal Government of Cambodia. Then, on November 26, 2012, The Government of Cambodia and Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and joint venture of the Royal Group of Cambodia (39%), Hydrolancang International Energy (51%), and Vietnam Electricity (EVN) (10%) — signed an implementation agreement (IA) for the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project. On the same day, Électricité du Cambodge (EDC) and Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Under these two agreements, Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. was granted a 45-year concession (40 years of operation and a construction period of 5 years) and it was specified that the electricity generated by Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. — through the Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant — would be sold to EDC at the fixed price of 6.95 US cents per kilowatt-hour. These agreements also specified that, after 40 years of operation, the ownership of the Lower Sesan II dam will be transferred to the Government of Cambodia. On December 12, 2012, the Government of Cambodia also agreed to guarantee the payment (power purchase) obligations of EDC and Cambodia’s Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy to Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd under the PPA and the IA.  The total cost of the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project, which was implemented on a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis, was $978 million and it was financed with a mix of debt and equity. In December 2013, China Development Bank (captured via Project ID#62217), ICBC (captured via Project ID#92481), and Bank of China (captured via Project ID#92483) provided a $781 million debt financing package (with a 17-year maturity and an interest rate of 6.5%) to Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. for the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project. The financing was structured in the 2 tranches: (i) an initial bridge financing with ICBC under a financial leasing structure (the first for an infrastructure project in Cambodia); and (ii) a subsequent project financing by China Development Bank and Bank of China.

The Lower Sesan II Dam is 80 meters tall and occupies a 36,000-hectare plot. The plant has eight turbines and each turbine has an installed capacity of 50 megawatts (400 MW total capacity).

The Chinese banks that financed the project divided environmental and social risks control into specific segments, including pre-loan investigation, loan review, contract management, loan issuance and post-loan management. They also required an environmental impact assessment (EIA) after the completion of the project. CDB went even further by introducing a standard review procedure. Sinosure also required that the project developer pay special attention to social and environmental responsibilities -- in particular, by resolving controversies around the dam through public consultation. The project developer held several public consultations with the affected communities in line with the guidelines of the Chinese banks. In July 2015, as requested by the local staff members of the CDB, the project developer held a dialogue with 140 people representing communities affected by the 400MW Lower Sesan II hydropower plant, Cambodian government representatives at national and sub-national levels, and NGOs to discuss their concerns and other issues related to the project. The participants then paid a visit on July 27, 2014 to the resettlement site to inspect on the quality of the housing construction, agricultural land, and dam construction. During the visit, community representatives and media held an informal on-site dialogue and raised questions to the Ministry of Mine and Energy’s secretary of state, project development, and the Stung Treng Deputy Governor in charge of Resettlement and Compensation Committee.   Nevertheless, the project was affected by protests from thousands of villagers who were at risk of being displaced or losing their livelihoods. On February 13, 2014, villagers living in the dam reservoir lodged a petition to the Chinese embassy in Phnom Penh, relevant ministries of the Cambodian government, and the developer to discuss compensation and resettlement conditions in detail. On August 10, 2021, Human Rights Watch released a report about the various ways in which the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project allegedly harmed the lives and livelihoods of thousands of indigenous and ethnic minority people. The report claims that the construction of the Lower Sesan 2 dam displaced nearly 5,000 people without adequately providing compensation or livelihood assistance.
