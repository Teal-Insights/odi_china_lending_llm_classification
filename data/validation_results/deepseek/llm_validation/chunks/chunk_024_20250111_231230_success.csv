The borrowing terms of the GCL are unknown. however, it is known that the borrower was to use the proceeds of the GCL to finance a commercial (EPC) contract between Tebian Electric Apparatus (TBEA) and Electricite du Laos (EDL), which was signed on January 28, 2016.   The purpose of the project is to construct 115kV substations, 115kV transmission lines and surrounding 22kV distribution lines in the capital city of Vientiane.   TBEA is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, Hubei Engineering Company Construction Company is also involved in the project (most likely as a subcontractor). A groundbreaking ceremony took place on November 21, 2017.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Vientiane 115/22kV Electricity Transmission Line Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. Laos’ gross foreign exchange reserves were dangerously low between 2019 and 2021, hovering between 1.4 and 2.3 months of import cover, and total public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt increased from 68 percent of GDP ($12.5 billion) in 2019 to 88 percent in 2021 of GDP (or $14.5 billion). According to a report published by the World Bank in April 2022, ‘[t]he energy sector, mostly represented by Électricité du Laos (EDL), accounted for over 30 percent of total PPG debt in 2021. […] EDL’s debt service obligations [were] still unsustainable [at the time], with future debt service accounting for about two fifths of EDL’s total operating revenue.’ The Laotian authorities sought and secured debt service payment deferrals from their Chinese creditors in 2020 and 2021; according to the World Bank, ‘[d]ebt service deferrals granted by major lenders in 2020-2021 amounted around 3.6 percent of GDP in 2021’ and ’[a]s a result, actual debt service payments are estimated to have declined to 48 percent of total revenues in 2021, compared to 65 percent in the 2021 [Government of Laos] plan.’  The country’s central bank (Bank of the Lao P.D.R) also made a $300 million drawdown under its currency swap agreement with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in June 2020 — when its gross reserves stood at only 1.5 months of import cover and credit rating agencies warned of a high default probability. Then, in 2021, the short-term emergency loan from the PBOC was ‘rolled over’ for another year. Around the same time, a Chinese state-owned enterprise purchased a major public infrastructure asset in Laos—a large part of the country’s electricity transmission grid—from EDL as part of an apparent debt-for-equity swap. China Southern Power Grid Co. and EDL established a joint venture known as Électricité du Laos Transmission Company Limited (EDLT) in September 2020.  China Southern Power Grid Co. purchased a 90% ownership stake in EDLT in exchange for a $600 million fee (equity infusion). Then, in March 2021, EDLT signed a 25-year concession agreement, which made it responsible for management of the country’s high-voltage transmission network above 230 kilovolts. Independent observers suggested at the time that EDL would likely use the $600 million upfront payment from China Southern Power Grid Co. to service its outstanding debts to Chinese creditors, although this has not been independently confirmed. According to the World Bank’s International Debt Statistics, the Government of Laos was responsible for making average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $232 million between 2019 and 2019 and average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $60 million between 2020 and 2021 (a substantially lower figure due to payment deferrals); however, it expected to make average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth nearly $678 million over the next seven years (2022-2028).","1.

Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility,  carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections. The process was managed by an office in the Angolan Ministry of Finance -- known as Gabinete de Apoio Técnico (GAT) -- that was specifically created to manage the MLFA with China Eximbank.  In February 2005, China Eximbank and the Government of Angola signed a $190,515,690.59 subsidiary buyer’s credit loan agreement under the November 2003 MLFA for the 357 km Quifangondo-Caxito-Uige-Negage Highway Rehabilitation Project (as captured via Project ID#34853).  The proceeds of this loan were used to partially finance a $211,684,100.65 commercial contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), which was signed on February 8, 2005.  Then, on July 19, 2007, China Eximbank entered into another $500 million MLFA with the Government of Angola (captured via Project ID#34030). The MLFA was meant to finance 'complementary actions' to the 2004 MLFA (captured via Project ID#42029).  The 2007 MLFA facility financed a total of 18 contracts, which supported projects originally undertaken through the 2004 MLFA.  ILAs approved through the 2007 MLFA carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee. Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  On July 19, 2007, the Government of Angola also received a supplementary $50,702,850.00 buyer's credit loan from China Eximbank under the July 2007 MLFA for 'complementary actions' related to the 357 km Quifangondo-Caxito-Uige-Negage Highway Rehabilitation Project (as captured via Project ID#66). The proceeds of the loan were used to partially finance a supplementary commercial contract with CRBC worth $56,336,500.00.  The purpose of the project, which employed 1336 Angolan workers and 367 Chinese workers, was the rehabilitation of a 357 km highway between Quifangondo and Negage via Caxito and Uige. The starting point of the road is in the town of Kifangondo, a northern suburb of Luanda City.  It extends northward through the city of Caxito, the capital of Bengo Province and the city of Uige, the capital of Uige Province.  The road terminates in the city of Negage, an important agricultural town within Uige Province.  The contract supporting the project went into effect on December 13, 2005 and the originally expected project handover date was June 30, 2008.  The project officially commenced on December 13, 2005; and a project handover ceremony took place on August 30, 2008.  The project was later inspected on March 8, 2014 by MOFCOM (ECCO) officials.","1. This project is also known as the 371 km Kifangondo-Caxito-Uige-Negage Highway Rehabilitation Project or the 221 Road Project.  The Chinese project title is 安哥拉吉方刚多－卡西托－威热－加吉道路修复项目 or 基凡冈都 --卡希托 -- 威热 -- 内加热公路.2. In July 2020, AidData asked Dr. Lucy Corkin, a leading expert on Chinese lending to Angola, whether the second, third, and fourth master loan facility agreements (MLFAs) that the Angolan Government signed with China Eximbank in 2007 and 2009 were structured as a buyer’s credit loans like the first MLFA that the Angolan Government signed with China Eximbank in 2004. Dr. Corkin noted that the second, third and fourth MLFAs were treated more like ceiling increases to the initial facility. Therefore, for the time being, AidData categorizes the second, third, and fourth MLFAs as buyer's credit loans. 3. The 2003 framework agreement (中华人民共和国商务部与安哥拉共和国财政部关于两国经贸合作特殊安排的框架协议) specified that Sinosure would be signing relevant agreements with the Government of Angola. Therefore, AidData has coded Sinosure as an accountable agency and as providing insurance for the loan.  4. AidData considers this loan to be collateralized in a de facto sense. The cash deposited by the Angolan Ministry of Finance into a bank account controlled by China Eximbank is, for all intents and purposes, a source of collateral. This is true even if the lender does not have a formal security interest in the account.5. For the time being, AidData assumes that the same maturities (21.5 years), grace periods (1.5 years), management fees (0.3%), and commitment fees (0.3%) that applied to the individual loan agreements under the March 2, 2004 MLFA also applied to individual loan agreements under the July 19, 2007 MLFA. This issue warrants further investigation.","# Sector

# Title
China Eximbank provides $50.5 million buyer’s credit loan for 357 km Quifangondo-Caxito-Uige-Negage Highway Rehabilitation Project (Linked to Project ID#34030, #34853)

# Description
On November 28, 2003, the Chinese Government and the Angolan Government signed a framework agreement pertaining to a special economic cooperation arrangement (Agreement name in Chinese: 中华人民共和国商务部与安哥拉共和国财政部关于两国经贸合作特殊安排的框架协议).  Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility,  carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections. The process was managed by an office in the Angolan Ministry of Finance -- known as Gabinete de Apoio Técnico (GAT) -- that was specifically created to manage the MLFA with China Eximbank.

Ltd (SSRL or (華信資源有限責任 公司) — a subsidiary of Global Mining (China) that was awarded a 30-year mining lease for Thar Coalfield Block I in October 2011— signed a cooperation framework agreement. Following the signing of this agreement, the two parties sought to establish an arrangement for the supply of coal to satisfy the coal consumption needs of a 1320 MW (2 x 660MW) coal-fired power plant project at Thar Coal Block-1 within Thar District and the Province of Sindh. As part of this deal, SSRL and SEGCL also entered into a coal supply agreement, in which SSRL will extract coal and supply it to China Power International (CPI). The mine is eventually expected to reach 20 million tons per year, which will be used for additional power plants as well as for export. In 2016, Pakistan’s Private Power Infrastructure Board issued a Letter of Intent to SEGCL to set up a 1320 MW supercritical indigenous coal-fired generation facility/thermal power plant at the project site. To facilitate the financing, development and operations of the power plant as well as a 7.8 million tons annual output (7.8 mtpa) coal mine, a special purpose vehicle called Thar Coal Block-1 Power Generation Company (Private) Limited (TCBPGCPL or 塔尔发电公司) was established on January 28, 2016. TCBPGCPL is jointly owned by Shanghai Electric Investment (Dubai) Limited (99.9997% equity stake) and 2 Chinese individuals in equal proportions (0.0003% equity stake). The total cost of the 1320MW Thar Block-1 Integrated Coal Mine and Power Project is $1.9122 billion. It is being implemented as an Independent Power Project — as part of the CPEC initiative — and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25.  On March 6, 2020, TCBPGCPL signed a $1.43 billion syndicated buyer’s credit (loan) agreement with China Development Bank (Project ID#53674), China Eximbank (Project ID#92628), ICBC (Project ID#92627), and Habib Bank for the 1320MW Thar Block-1 Integrated Coal Mine and Power Project. SEGCL/SEPCO agreed to provide $478 million of equity. The borrowing terms of the syndicated loan are unknown. However, it is known that Sinosure provided buyer’s credit insurance. It is also known that TCBPGCPL acquired 232.32 acres of land within the Thar Coalfield Block-I and the Government of Pakistan allowed TCBPGCPL to mortgage the land to its lenders.  The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance two contracts: a $434,750,358 commercial (EPC) contract between Shanghai Electric Engineering Consulting Company Limited（上海電 氣工程設計有限公司) and SSRL, which was signed on April 17, 2019; and a $467,956,549 commercial (EPC) contract between Shanghai Electric Hongkong International Engineering Company Limited（上海電氣香港國際工程有限公司) and SSRL, which was signed on April 17, 2019. Then, on August 27, 2019, TCBPGCPL and Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (Guarantee) Limited (CCP-G) signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). The Government of Pakistan has not only issued a CCP-G payment guarantee but also a 20% return on equity (ROE) guarantee.  The purpose of the project is to construct a 1320 MW supercritical indigenous coal-fired generation facility/thermal power plant and to develop an integrated coal mine with an annual production capacity of 7.8 million tons. The power plant will consist of two, 660 MW supercritical units having supercritical variable pressure operation coal-fired tower type boiler with single furnace, extraction condensing steam turbine and inner-cooled generator. It is envisaged that the power plant will eventually be connected with the 660kV Matiari-Lahore HVDC Transmission Line Project (captured via Project ID#54013). An estimated 600 families will be displaced due to the coal mining and installation of the power plant. The Thar Block-1 covers approximately 122 km2 in the southern part of the Thar coalfield area in the Thar Desert in the Sindh province of Pakistan, approximately 380km east of Karachi. The Thar coalfield area covers approximately 9,000 km2 and is bounded by the Pakistan-India border to the north, east, and south. The 1.3GW coal-fired power plant being developed as part of the integrated project is located approximately 5km away from the pithead of the Thar Block-1 coal mine. Shanghai Electric Engineering Consulting Company Limited and Shanghai Electric Hongkong International Engineering Company Limited are the EPC contractors responsible for implementation.  Mining work on the Thar Coal Block-I mine and plant began in October 2019. Then, in December 2019, the Government of Pakistan’s Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) signed an implementation agreement (IA) with Shanghai Electric for the project. Construction was temporarily suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic. Then, in August 2020, a batch of 500 Chinese workers and managers arrived in Pakistan by a special chartered flight, which accelerated the implementation of the project. In February 2021, almost 40% of work related to coal mining was reportedly completed and construction work was also in progress on the power station. The first unit (660MW) is expected to be operational by August 2022, while the expected commercial operations date (COD) is February 2023. 4,767 people are reportedly being employed by the project (of which 1381 are Chinese and 3386 are Pakistani).","1. This project is also known as the 1320MW SSRL Thar Coal Block-I 7.8 mtpa & Power Plant (2×660MW), the 1.32GW Thar Block-1 Integrated Coal Mine-Power Project, the SSRL Thar Coal Block-I Shanghai Electric Coal Plant Project, the Pakistan SSRL Thar Coal Block-I Coal Plant Project, or the 2 X 660 MW Mine-Mouth Coal-Fired Power Generation Plant at Thar Block-1 Project. The Chinese project title is 与塔尔电站项目 or 巴基斯坦塔尔煤田项目 or 巴基斯坦塔尔煤田一区块煤电一体化项目.2. According to multiple, official sources, the Government of Pakistan has issued sovereign guarantees in support of all loans issued by Chinese state-owned banks for independent power projects (IPPs) in Pakistan (see https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cepk/chn/zbgx/t1735166.htm and http://pk.chineseembassy.org/eng/zbgx/202110/t20211010_9558510.htm and https://www.dropbox.com/s/bmx3w2b38o7guxm/Debt%20Pricing%20of%20IPPs%20%28002%29.pdf?dl=0). As such, AidData assumes that the loan captured in this record is backed by a sovereign guarantee from the Government of Pakistan. The precise loan commitment date is unknown. One source (http://cpec.gov.pk/project-details/9) suggests that the project reached financial close on December 31, 2019. Another source indicated that the project reached financial close in February 2020. Still another source indicates that the syndicated loan agreement was signed in January 2020. For the time being, AidData has coded the commitment date as December 31, 2019. However, this issue merits additional investigation.3. Thar Coal Block-1 Power Generation Company (Private) Limited (TCBPGCPL)— the SPV (project company) responsible for repaying the syndicated loan — is also known as TCB-I and 塔尔发电公司.4. ICBC reportedly contributed $358.5 million to the $1.43 billion syndicated loan (i.e. one-quarter of the face value of the loan). The size of the contributions from CDB, China Eximbank, and Habib Bank are unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes that CDB, China Eximbank, and ICBC each contributed $358.5 million (i.e. equally sized contributions to the lending syndicate).5. The Thar coalfield holds an estimated lignite resource of over 175 billion tons. It is spread over an area of more than 9,000 square kilometers in the Thar Desert in the southeastern part of the Pakistani province.6. For the time being, AidData assumes that the borrowing terms of the loan are identical to those reported in NEPRA’s approval of the upfront tariff application submitted by TCBPGCPL (https://nepra.org.pk/tariff/Tariff/IPPs/003%20Coal/Thar%20Coal%20Block-I/TRF-360%20TCB-I%20Upfront%20Tariff%208694-96%2010-06-2016.PDF): 10-year maturity, 4-year grace period, and 4.95% interest rate.7. SSRL was owned 55% by Global Mining China (GMC) and 40% by Asiapak Investments, with the remaining 5% owned by a Dubai-based company. However, in September 2018, Shanghai Electric agreed to become the controlling shareholder of SSRL.","# Sector
