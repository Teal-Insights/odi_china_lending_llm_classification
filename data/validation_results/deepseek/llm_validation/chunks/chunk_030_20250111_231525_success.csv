The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 5-year maturity and an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a margin of 3.3%. It was secured by (i.e. collateralized against) the assets of Cerro de Maimón copper and gold mine operations in the Dominican Republic. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to facilitate its acquisition of Globestar Mining Corporation, a company responsible for the Cerro de Maimón copper-gold mine in the Dominican Republic. By the end of 2010, the CDB loan had achieved a 91.2% disbursement rate ($91.2 million out of $100 million). Perilya made its first principal repayment of US$4.6 million in January 2011. The loan’s outstanding amount was $86.6 million as of December 31, 2011. Perilya, Ltd.’s acquisition of Globestar Mining Corporation was completed in December 2010.   Cerro de Maimón, is an operating copper/gold mine in the Dominican Republic. Cerro de Maimón hosts approximately 6 million tonnes of open-pit copper/gold reserves, as reported in a National Instrument 43-101 compliant technical report dated August 2007 by independent consultants. The Cerro de Maimón property, and surrounding 3,391 hectare exploitation concession, was acquired from Falconbridge Dominicana (Falcondo) in April 2002. Falcondo retained a 2% NSR of which Perilya purchased 50% in 2008. The company owns 100% of the deposit, subject to the remaining 1% NSR retained by Falcondo. The Dominican Secretary of State of Environment and Natural Resources granted the Environmental License to Perilya to mine the Cerro de Maimón mineral deposit in 2004. There is potential for expanding the reserve base of the operation from satellite deposits in Perilya's 100% owned Maimón Concession surrounding the Cerro de Maimón deposit. The Maimón Concession covers approximately 85% of the Maimón massive sulphide belt. operationsOpen pit mining operations Construction of the approximately $69 million open pit mine, processing facilities and related infrastructure began in December 2006 and was completed in October 2008. The operation has separate processing facilities for the sulphide and oxide ores. Copper is recovered from the sulphide ores with co-product gold and silver. The oxide ore is treated to recover gold-silver doré. Mining is done by a contractor using a fleet of articulated trucks, rigid body trucks and hydraulic excavators. The mined ore is sent to the appropriate sulphide or oxide ore stockpiles and waste rock to one of the several waste rock disposal piles on the property. Both the sulphide and oxide plants use the same crushing and conveying system. The two-stage crushing system reduces the ore to minus ¾ inch. The sulphide ore is processed through a 1,300 tonne per day flotation circuit using large capacity circular flotation cells followed by a re-cleaner flotation column. Primary grinding is done with a 12' x 14' ball mill with 80% passing 150 microns. A second 11' x 13' regrind mill grinds the rougher flotation concentrate to 80% passing 35 microns. The overflow from the regrind cyclone passes directly to the cleaner cells before going to the flotation column. The concentrate from the flotation column is then thickened and filtered in order to reduce the final moisture content of the concentrate to about 6%. View of processing facilities at Cerro de Maimón Concentrate is trucked to the port of Río Haina on the southern coast of the Dominican Republic where it is loaded and shipped to customers overseas. The oxide ore is processed via grinding in an 8' x 15' ball mill followed by conventional agitated cyanide leaching, counter current decantation thickening and Merrill-Crowe gold and silver recovery at a rate of 700 tonnes per day. Tailings and potentially acid generating (PAG) waste rock are deposited in a co-disposal facility designed by Golder Associates.

CDB provides $100 million loan to Perilya to facilitate its acquisition of Globestar Mining Corporation

# Description
In 2010, China Development Bank and Perilya, Ltd. signed a $100 million long-term facility (loan) agreement.  The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 5-year maturity and an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a margin of 3.3%. It was secured by (i.e. collateralized against) the assets of Cerro de Maimón copper and gold mine operations in the Dominican Republic. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to facilitate its acquisition of Globestar Mining Corporation, a company responsible for the Cerro de Maimón copper-gold mine in the Dominican Republic. By the end of 2010, the CDB loan had achieved a 91.2% disbursement rate ($91.2 million out of $100 million). Perilya made its first principal repayment of US$4.6 million in January 2011. The loan’s outstanding amount was $86.6 million as of December 31, 2011. Perilya, Ltd.’s acquisition of Globestar Mining Corporation was completed in December 2010.   Cerro de Maimón, is an operating copper/gold mine in the Dominican Republic. Cerro de Maimón hosts approximately 6 million tonnes of open-pit copper/gold reserves, as reported in a National Instrument 43-101 compliant technical report dated August 2007 by independent consultants. The Cerro de Maimón property, and surrounding 3,391 hectare exploitation concession, was acquired from Falconbridge Dominicana (Falcondo) in April 2002. Falcondo retained a 2% NSR of which Perilya purchased 50% in 2008. The company owns 100% of the deposit, subject to the remaining 1% NSR retained by Falcondo. The Dominican Secretary of State of Environment and Natural Resources granted the Environmental License to Perilya to mine the Cerro de Maimón mineral deposit in 2004.

However, the ADB did not follow up on the project due to its marginal financial viability and its potentially serious environmental and social impacts, especially on migratory fish stocks and fishing livelihoods. Then, in June 2007, the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy (MIME) of Cambodia granted permission for Electricité du Viet Nam (EVN) to conduct a detailed feasibility study. The study was implemented by a consulting firm, Power Engineering Consulting Joint Stock Company 1 (PECC1), in collaboration and consultation with technical ministries/agencies of the Royal Government of Cambodia. Then, on November 26, 2012, The Government of Cambodia and Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and joint venture of the Royal Group of Cambodia (39%), Hydrolancang International Energy (51%), and Vietnam Electricity (EVN) (10%) — signed an implementation agreement (IA) for the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project. On the same day, Électricité du Cambodge (EDC) and Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Under these two agreements, Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. was granted a 45-year concession (40 years of operation and a construction period of 5 years) and it was specified that the electricity generated by Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. — through the Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant — would be sold to EDC at the fixed price of 6.95 US cents per kilowatt-hour. These agreements also specified that, after 40 years of operation, the ownership of the Lower Sesan II dam will be transferred to the Government of Cambodia. On December 12, 2012, the Government of Cambodia also agreed to guarantee the payment (power purchase) obligations of EDC and Cambodia’s Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy to Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd under the PPA and the IA.  The total cost of the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project, which was implemented on a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis, was $978 million and it was financed with a mix of debt and equity. In December 2013, China Development Bank (captured via Project ID#62217), ICBC (captured via Project ID#92481), and Bank of China (captured via Project ID#92483) provided a $781 million debt financing package (with a 17-year maturity and an interest rate of 6.5%) to Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. for the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project. The financing was structured in the 2 tranches: (i) an initial bridge financing with ICBC under a financial leasing structure (the first for an infrastructure project in Cambodia); and (ii) a subsequent project financing by China Development Bank and Bank of China. Sinosure provided credit insurance. The Government of Cambodia issued a sovereign guarantee in the event on non-payment by EDC.  The purpose of this project was to construct a hydroelectric power plant in the northeastern province of Stung Treng on the Se San River. Its locational coordinates are 13°32′59.5″N 106°15′49.4″E. The Lower Sesan II Dam is 80 meters tall and occupies a 36,000-hectare plot. The plant has eight turbines and each turbine has an installed capacity of 50 megawatts (400 MW total capacity). Upon completion, the plant was expected to produce 1.9 billion kilowatt-hours per year, boost electricity production in the country by 20%, and bring installed hydropower capacity to 1328MW.  PowerChina HuaDong Engineering Corporation Limited (HDEC) was the contractor responsible for project design. Sinohydro Bureau 8 Co., Ltd was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began in December 2013. The watergate was officially closed on September 25, 2017. The first turbine began producing electricity in November 2017. The dam was officially opened on December 18, 2018.   The Chinese banks that financed the project divided environmental and social risks control into specific segments, including pre-loan investigation, loan review, contract management, loan issuance and post-loan management. They also required an environmental impact assessment (EIA) after the completion of the project. CDB went even further by introducing a standard review procedure. Sinosure also required that the project developer pay special attention to social and environmental responsibilities -- in particular, by resolving controversies around the dam through public consultation. The project developer held several public consultations with the affected communities in line with the guidelines of the Chinese banks. In July 2015, as requested by the local staff members of the CDB, the project developer held a dialogue with 140 people representing communities affected by the 400MW Lower Sesan II hydropower plant, Cambodian government representatives at national and sub-national levels, and NGOs to discuss their concerns and other issues related to the project. The participants then paid a visit on July 27, 2014 to the resettlement site to inspect on the quality of the housing construction, agricultural land, and dam construction. During the visit, community representatives and media held an informal on-site dialogue and raised questions to the Ministry of Mine and Energy’s secretary of state, project development, and the Stung Treng Deputy Governor in charge of Resettlement and Compensation Committee.   Nevertheless, the project was affected by protests from thousands of villagers who were at risk of being displaced or losing their livelihoods. On February 13, 2014, villagers living in the dam reservoir lodged a petition to the Chinese embassy in Phnom Penh, relevant ministries of the Cambodian government, and the developer to discuss compensation and resettlement conditions in detail.
