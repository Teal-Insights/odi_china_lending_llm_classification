47065,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",Chalco provides $350 million loan to Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi LLC to facilitate coal exports,"On July 26, 2011, Aluminum Corporation of China Limited (Chalco) and Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi LLC (ETT) — a special purpose vehicle and subsidiary of the Mongolian state-owned company Erdenes MGL — signed a $350 million (260 million euros) loan agreement. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower received a $350 million ‘advance payment’ from the lender and it was allowed to repay the loan with cash or coal from Tavan Tolgoi, which is a coal deposit located in the Ömnögovi Province in southern Mongolia.   When the loan agreement was signed, ETT and Chalco also signed a long-term steelmaking coal supply contract. Under the term of this contract, Chalco agreed to purchase coal from ETT at a price of $70 per ton (well below the $200+ per-ton price of Australian coking coal). In 2012, ETT sold 2.4 million tons of coking coal to Chalco, 3 million tons less than it had originally planned to export. Then, on January 11, 2013, ETT halted coal deliveries to Chalco and announced that it would only supply coal to Chalco if the Chinese state-owned company revised the prices and volumes in the July 2011 supply contract. According to ETT, it was losing $5 on every ton of coal delivered because of rising transportation costs and the price that Chalco was paying for the coal. ETT also claimed that prices were set below the actual cost of extracting and delivering the coal. In March 2013, ETT failed to honor an $86 million loan repayment obligation to Chalco.   Then, in April 2013, ETT agreed to pay a higher interest rate on its total outstanding debt ($186 million) to Chalco as part of an agreement to resume coal deliveries. ETT restarted coal shipments to Chalco on April 22, 2013 after securing a $3 per-ton-of-coal price increase from Chalco. Chalco reportedly agreed to pay $56 per ton and ETT reportedly agreed to supply 5 to 6 million tons of coal to Chalco by the end of 2013. ETT subsequently began to mine Mongolia’s West Tsankhi coal area to ramp up output and expedite the repayment of its outstanding debt to Chalco. In March 2017, ETT announced that the Chalco loan had been repaid in full — partially through coal exports and partially through cash (from the proceeds of a loan that ETT received from from the Mongolian Government).","1. The proceeds of the $350 million Chalco loan were to be used by the borrower as prepayment for coking coal mined from Tavan Tolgoi. As such, the loan that was issued likely came in the form of a pre-export finance (PXF) facility. A PXF facility is an arrangement in which a commodity producer gets up-front cash from a customer in return for a promise to repay the customer with that commodity (possibly at a discount) in the future. PXF funds may be advanced by a lender or syndicate of lenders to a commodity producer to assist the company in meeting either its working capital needs (for example, to cover the purchase of raw materials and costs associated with processing, storage and transport) or its capital investment needs (for example, investment in plant and machinery and other elements of infrastructure). PXF facilities are usually secured by (1) an assignment of rights by the producer under an ‘offtake contract’ (i.e., a sale and purchase contract between the producer and a buyer of that producer of goods or commodities), and (2) a collection account charge over a bank account into which proceeds due to the producer from the buyer of the goods or commodities under the offtake contract are credited. There are two key documents in prepayment finance transactions: a contract providing for the advance payment by the offtaker to the producer for the purchase of goods/commodities (the 'Prepayment Contract'), and a loan agreement between a lender and the offtaker (the 'Offtaker Loan Agreement') under which the advance payment is financed. 2. The maturity field is set to 5.5 years based on the loan signature date and the final loan repayment date. The interest rate field is set to 12% because, in 2015, Mongolia Government Minister M.Enkhsaikhan disclosed that the borrower was repaying its debt to Chalco at a 12% interest rate in 2015. 3. Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi JSC is a project company and special purpose vehicle was founded on August 27, 2010. According to the Resolutions of Mongolian Parliament and Government, Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi JSC started to operate since December 23, 2010 as a subsidiary of Erdenes Mongol LLC to mine the Tavan Tolgoi coal deposit. The main operation of Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi JSC focuses on putting strategic mine deposits into economic activities, carrying out exploitation on the deposits and implementing infrastructure projects. Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi JSC has 588 employees, all of whom are Mongolians. 4. Some sources indicate that the borrower received a $250 million ‘advance payment’ rather than a $350 million ‘advance payment’ from the lender. This issue warrants further investigation.","# Sector

(IC Ictas-Astaldi or ICA) — a joint venture between an Italian construction company called Astaldi S.P.A (33.33% ownership stake) and a Turkish construction company called IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S. (66.66% ownership stake) — for the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project (also known as the Third Bosphorus Bridge PPP Project and the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge PPP Project). 30 months of the 10-year concession is for bridge construction activities and the remaining period is for bridge management activities. The public-private partnership (PPP) project was implemented on a BOT (Build, Operate, Transfer) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. The original, non-recourse $2.67 billion debt financing package consisted of two syndicated loan agreements with two different special purpose vehicles (project companies): a $1.04 billion loan with Avrupa Otoyolu Yatirim ve Iletme A.S. for the 171 km Kurtköy-Akyazı Section (“Asia Section” or “NMM Asia”) of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project and a $1.63 billion loan with KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. for the 90 km Kınalı-Odayeri Section (“Europe Section” or “NMM Europe”) of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project. The loan agreements were signed in September 2013 and financial close was achieved May 2014. The loan were issued by six local banks, including Turkish banks (Türkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Is Bankasi A.S., QNB Finansbank A.S., T.C. Ziraat Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. and Türkiye Vakiflar Bankasi T.A.O.). One loan will mature in December 2022 (with a fixed interest rate of 7.6%) and the other will mature in June 2024 (with a floating interest rate of LIBOR + 550 basis points).   Additionally, $600 million of equity financing was provided by Astaldi S.P.A and IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S.: $387.33 million IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S. and $193.67 million from Astaldi S.P.A. The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee, agreeing to repay the debt incurred by borrower/project company (IC Ictas-Astaldi) in the event that it defaulted on its repayment obligations. The Government of Turkey’s General Directorate of Highways (KGM) also provided a minimum traffic guarantee to the project company (to secure the payback of the debt and equity if the generated revenue was insufficient).   Then, in 2018, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's branch in Turkey (ICBC Turkey) was mandated by IC Ictas-Astaldi to lead and arrange syndication for the refinancing of $2.67 billion of debt used to construct the Third Bosphorus Bridge (or Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge) and North Marmara Motorway PPP Project. A letter of authorization for the refinancing was signed at the One Belt, One Road Investment and Financial Cooperation Summit in Ankara on July 26, 2018.

The two loans have two different maturity lengths, reflecting the different concession lengths of the two sponsors. The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee for both loans on September 16, 2019.

The purpose of the project was to construct a 1.408 kilometer long-span bridge to be used by road vehicles and trains to cross the Bosphorus Strait from Poyrazkoy in Asia to Garipce in Europe, as well as the construction of a section of the North Marmara Highway along the Odayeri-Pasakoy route. The bridge is 59 meters long and it stretches 1,408 meters over the Bosporus, linking the European and Asian sides of Istanbul. It has eight highway lanes (4 in each direction), divided by two high-speed rail corridors of 1,048 meters. The bridge is a critical part of the larger Northern Marmara Highway (Motorway) Project, linking to the Odayeri-Pasaköy route of the Motorway. The 261 km km Northern Marmara Highway was intended to increase economic efficiency in Turkey, allow for greater access to Istanbul Airport, provide alternate routes to going through Istanbul, and start on the western side of Istanbul and end in the eastern Marmara province of Sakarya. ICA IC İçtaş Astaldi Üçüncü Boğaz Köprüsü ve Kuzey Marmara Otoyolu Yatırım ve İşletme A.Ş. (IC Ictas-Astaldi) was responsible for project implementation. Construction began in September 2012 using the SPV's equity, and was originally expected to take 36 months. The Odayeri-Paşaköy section of the motorway was completed August 26, 2016. The Kurtköy-Akyazı section of the project was completed and opened to traffic on December 19, 2020.   On December 23, 2019, China Merchants Expressway Network & Technology Holdings Co. Ltd, China Merchants Union (BVI) Limited, Jiangsu Expressway Company Limited, Zhejiang Expressway Co. Ltd., Anhui Expressway Company Limited and Sichuan Expressway Co announced that it had entered an agreement and jointly set up a consortium company (“Consortium Company”) to acquire: (1) 51% equity stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi (the SPV responsible for the Third Bosphorus Bridge PPP Project); (2) 51% of a related shareholder loan of IC Ictas-Astaldi; and (3) 51% equity stake in Eurasia Motorway Maintenance and Operations Limited (“IC Maintenance”), a company engages in the operations and maintenance of projects operated by IC Ictas-Astaldi. Shareholders of the Consortium Company expected to invest up to $688.5 million. As a part of the acquisition, China Merchants, China Merchants United, Zhejiang Expressway, Jiangsu Expressway, Sichuan Expressway and Anhui Expressway held 31%, 20%, 17.5%, 17.5%, 7% and 7% equity stakes in the Consortium Company, respectively. Upon completion of the acquisition, the Zhejiang Expressway Co., Ltd. would indirectly hold an 8.925% equity stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi, 8.925% of the related shareholder loan of IC Ictas-Astaldi, and an 8.925% equity stake in IC Maintenance, respectively. However, the preliminary agreement that was signed on December 23, 2019 was interrupted due to the Covid-19 pandemic. ICBC, Bank of China, and China Merchants Bank subsequently indicated that they were willing to issue a $1.6 billion loan to the Consortium Company in 2021 to facilitate their acquisition of a 51% ownership stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi for $688.5 million. Their loan would mature in 2027, just before the project company’s concession expired. Sinosure would provide credit insurance. However, IJ Global reported in August 2021 that the Chinese companies in the Consortium Company requested to enter into negotiations to terminate the acquisition agreement. Then, in March 2020, Astaldi sold its stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi (the SPV) to IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S., with the latter becoming the sole owner.","1. Some sources suggest that the $1,198,302,550 loan is a syndicated loan and Bank of China is a participant in the syndicate. This issue warrants further investigation. 2. Some sources suggest that the December 2, 2021 loan agreement was worth $2.4 billion rather than $1,198,302,550. This issue warrants further investigation. 3.

ICBC provides $1.2 billion loan to KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi for the construction of the Odayeri-Paşaköy Section of the Northern Marmara Motorway (including Third Bosphorus Bridge) Project

# Description
On May 29, 2012, Turkey's Ministry of Transport granted a 10-year concession agreement to ICA IC İçtaş Astaldi Üçüncü Boğaz Köprüsü ve Kuzey Marmara Otoyolu Yatırım ve İşletme A.Ş. (IC Ictas-Astaldi or ICA) — a joint venture between an Italian construction company called Astaldi S.P.A (33.33% ownership stake) and a Turkish construction company called IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S. (66.66% ownership stake) — for the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project (also known as the Third Bosphorus Bridge PPP Project and the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge PPP Project). 30 months of the 10-year concession is for bridge construction activities and the remaining period is for bridge management activities. The public-private partnership (PPP) project was implemented on a BOT (Build, Operate, Transfer) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. The original, non-recourse $2.67 billion debt financing package consisted of two syndicated loan agreements with two different special purpose vehicles (project companies): a $1.04 billion loan with Avrupa Otoyolu Yatirim ve Iletme A.S. for the 171 km Kurtköy-Akyazı Section (“Asia Section” or “NMM Asia”) of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project and a $1.63 billion loan with KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. for the 90 km Kınalı-Odayeri Section (“Europe Section” or “NMM Europe”) of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project. The loan agreements were signed in September 2013 and financial close was achieved May 2014. The loan were issued by six local banks, including Turkish banks (Türkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Is Bankasi A.S., QNB Finansbank A.S., T.C. Ziraat Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. and Türkiye Vakiflar Bankasi T.A.O.). One loan will mature in December 2022 (with a fixed interest rate of 7.6%) and the other will mature in June 2024 (with a floating interest rate of LIBOR + 550 basis points).   Additionally, $600 million of equity financing was provided by Astaldi S.P.A and IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S.: $387.33 million IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S. and $193.67 million from Astaldi S.P.A. The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee, agreeing to repay the debt incurred by borrower/project company (IC Ictas-Astaldi) in the event that it defaulted on its repayment obligations. The Government of Turkey’s General Directorate of Highways (KGM) also provided a minimum traffic guarantee to the project company (to secure the payback of the debt and equity if the generated revenue was insufficient).   Then, in 2018, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's branch in Turkey (ICBC Turkey) was mandated by IC Ictas-Astaldi to lead and arrange syndication for the refinancing of $2.67 billion of debt used to construct the Third Bosphorus Bridge (or Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge) and North Marmara Motorway PPP Project. A letter of authorization for the refinancing was signed at the One Belt, One Road Investment and Financial Cooperation Summit in Ankara on July 26, 2018. Under the agreement, ICBC Turkey agreed in principle to facilitate the refinancing of the project, previously funded by the Turkish banking system, on more favorable terms.   Then, in September 2019, two syndicated loan agreements worth $4.435 billion were signed (with ICBC serving as the lead arranger) for the Kurtköy-Akyazı and Kınalı-Odayeri sections of the project: a $2,840,000,000 loan agreement was signed by KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. and a group of ten lenders (ICBC Turkey, Bank of China, Kuveyt Türk Katilim Bankasi A.S., Albaraka Türk Katılım Bankası A.Ş., Türkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Is Bankasi A.S., QNB Finansbank A.S., T.C. Ziraat Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. and Türkiye Vakiflar Bankasi T.A.O.) to refinance the $1.04 billion loan that was issued in September 2013 for the 171 km Kurtköy-Akyazı Section of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project and finance new/additional capex requirements as a result of changes in the project scope (that increased the total cost of the project’s 171 km Kurtköy-Akyazı Section to $3.646 billion); and a $1,595,000,000 loan was signed by KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. and a group of ten lenders (ICBC Turkey, Bank of China, Kuveyt Türk Katilim Bankasi A.S., Albaraka Türk Katılım Bankası A.Ş., Türkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Is Bankasi A.S., QNB Finansbank A.S., T.C. Ziraat Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. and Türkiye Vakiflar Bankasi T.A.O.) to refinance the $1.63 billion loan that was issued in September 2013 for the 90 km Kınalı-Odayeri Section of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project and finance new/additional capex requirements as a result of changes in the project scope (that increased the total cost of the project’s 90 km Kınalı-Odayeri Section to $2.077 billion). The two loans have two different maturity lengths, reflecting the different concession lengths of the two sponsors. The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee for both loans on September 16, 2019. The total amount that was reportedly provided (across both loans) by ICBC Turkey was $1 billion (as captured via Project ID#67325). Bank of China’s estimated contribution to both loans ($381,666,666) is captured via Project ID#67331.   Then, on December 2, 2021, ICBC and KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. signed a $1,198,302,550 loan agreement (captured via Project ID#96108) to refinance a $2,138,000,000 loan that was issued on May 13, 2014 signed in 2014 and a $420,000,000 loan that was issued on March 11, 2016 for the Odayeri-Paşaköy Section of the Northern Marmara Motorway (including Third Bosphorus Bridge) Project. The borrowing terms of the ICBC loan are unknown.  The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee for the $1,198,302,550 loan on December 2, 2021.

Then, on September 15, 2017, the Sierra Leone Ports Authority, the National Commission for Privatization of the Republic of Sierra Leone, the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone, Sky Rock Management Limited, and National Port Development (SL) Ltd. signed a concession agreement in connection with the Upgrade and Expansion of the Queen Elizabeth II Port in Freetown. The agreement granted National Port Development (SL) Ltd. (塞拉利昂共和国国家港口发展有限公) — a project company and special purpose vehicle (SPV) — the right to expand, upgrade, and operate Queen Elizabeth II Port for 25 years.  On November 29, 2017, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of (ICBC) and the Export-Import Bank of China signed a $659 million syndicated facility (loan) agreement with National Port Development (SL) Ltd. for the Port Elizabeth II Upgrading and Expansion Project. Of the total $659 million (captured via Umbrella Project ID#62222), China Eximbank contributed $130 million (captured via Project ID#62224) and ICBC contributed $529 million (captured via Project ID#62223). The syndicated loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus 350 basis points, a 2% default (penalty) interest rate, and a commitment fee of 0.5%. The loan is secured by (i.e. collateralized against) project revenues/port development levy fees deposited in a lender-controlled bank account, the proceeds from the borrower’s Sinosure credit insurance policy, Sky Rock Management Ltd.’s equity stake (shares) in the project company [National Port Development (SL) Ltd.], project machinery and equipment, and all movable assets (tangible or intangible) of the concessionaire in connection with the ‘New Port’ (as defined in the concession agreement and AidData’s ‘Staff Comments’). Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development issued a sovereign guarantee for the loan, and the borrower was required to use part of the loan proceeds to purchase a credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure), which insures 95% of the facility plus accrued interest against political and commercial risk.  The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower, National Port Development (SL) Ltd., to finance a $708,295,101 commercial contract that it signed with a consortium of Chinese companies -- consisting of Tidfore Heavy Equipment Group Co., Ltd. (泰富重装集), China Integrity International Oceaneering, Co., Ltd., Tidfore (Tianjin) Oceaneering Equipment Co., Ltd., and Tianjin Jinhao International Trade Co., Ltd.-- which was signed on March 8, 2017 and amended on November 29, 2017. In order to facilitate loan repayment, Tidifore will collect a ‘development levy fee,’ which will be charged over and above the usual port handling charges. This fee is expected to generate $950 million over a 16 year period. Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development has reportedly flagged that this fee could raise the cost using the port to such a high level that shippers will avoid using it, thereby leading to an overall loss of revenue and threatening the borrower’s ability to repay the loan (thus raising concerns about the Government of Sierra Leone’s contingent liability).  The purpose of the Port Elizabeth II Upgrading Project is to renovate the facilities at Queen Elizabeth II Quay in Freetown, which is operated by Sierra Leone Ports Authority. It involves the design and construction of four new terminals and yards for the quay. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on November 29, 2017, and construction began in December 2017.  This project has become a source of local controversy and scrutiny. In 2018, the implementation of the project was reportedly halted (at least temporarily) after reports emerged that the legal entity responsible for the project—National Port Development (SL) Ltd.—was owned by Israeli businessman who had generously contributed to the President of Sierra Leone’s reelection campaign during the previous year. The IMF also sounded the alarm after learning that Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee in support of a syndicated loan, which placed an extraordinarily large contingent liability (worth 15% of the country’s GDP) on the government’s books.","1. This project is also known as the Queen Elizabeth II Quay Upgrading Project. The Chinese project title is 重装塞拉利昂弗里敦伊丽莎白二世港改扩建工程建 or 塞拉利昂弗里敦伊丽莎白二世港改扩建工程建 or 弗里敦伊丽莎白二世港口改扩建工程 or 非洲塞拉利昂港口改扩建项目 or 弗里敦伊丽莎白二世港改扩建 or 弗里敦伊丽莎白二世港改扩建.2. AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate (5.126%) by adding 3.5% to average 6-month LIBOR rate during the month (November 2017) when the loan agreement was finalized (1.626%).3. This loan is not included in the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020.4. No sources explicitly state that this is a buyer's credit loan. AidData assumes this is the case for the following reasons: (1) The loan is provided to a foreign borrower, (2) the loan is denominated in USD, (3) the face value of the loan is explicitly identified in multiple official sources, (4) the loan is used to finance a commercial contract with a Chinese company, and (5) the loan was insured by Sinosure via its export buyer's credit insurance service, which is specifically used when banks are providing buyer's credit financing.5. The syndicated loan agreement can be accessed in its entirety via https://www.dropbox.com/s/9s9cun72yezhkds/ICBC%20Facility%20Agreement%20with%20National%20Port%20Development%20%28SL%29%20LTD..pdf?dl=0.6.

The concession agreement can be accessed in its entirety via https://www.dropbox.com/s/asxeufc4d8ekfhp/Concession%20Agreement%20No.354.pdf?dl=0.8. The Facility Agreement references the following Security Documents: (a) Share Pledge Agreement: Sky Rock Ltd., the foreign investor, enters a share pledge agreement ‘in respect of their shares in the Borrower in favour of the Security Agent, in form and substance satisfactory to the Facility Agent’ (p. 18). The Share Pledge Agreement is separate from the Facility Agreement and not publicly available, so it is unknown under what circumstances ownership in the project company could be transferred from the foreign investor to the creditors. (b) Mortgage over Assets: The Borrower enters a mortgage agreement over ‘equipment and other assets of the Borrower in relation to the Project […] in favour of the Finance Parties, in form and substance satisfactory to the Facility Agent’ (p. 13). The Mortgage Agreement is separate from the Facility Agreement and not public, so it is unknown which assets are pledged. (c) Other security documents which evidence or create ‘security over any asset of the Borrower to secure any obligation of the Borrower under the Finance Documents’ (p. 17). Since no other security documents are publicly available, no further details are known. In addition to the Security Documents, the Facility Agreement references an Account Agreement. Again, this is a separate document that is not publicly available. Cross references in the Facility Agreement show that ICBC and China Eximbank can designate ‘a bank outside the jurisdiction of Sierra Leone’ at which the ‘Bank Accounts are opened and maintained’ (p. 1). The conditions of utilization further reveal that the Borrower is required to transfer project revenue into this account so that the account balance at all times meets the minimum debt service coverage of ‘all principal scheduled to be paid and all interested expected to be payable under the Facility on the next Interest Payment Date’ (p. 16). In addition, the repayment of the loan is fully guaranteed by Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance. In particular, the Ministry ‘guarantees to ensure that if […] the balance of the Borrower Collection Account falls to an amount that is less than is required to meet the next Scheduled Debt Service payment […], the Guarantor shall pay, or procure to be paid, into that account, such amount as may be necessary to ensure that the balance of the account is equal to the amount of the next Scheduled Debt Service payment’ (p. 143). The Concession Agreement specifies that ‘the Concessionaire shall be entitled to create Security over its rights, title, and interest in the Port Development Levy Fees and the New Port Assets in favor of the Finance Parties for the purpose of the Financing provided that any such Security shall not continue for a period exceeding the Concession Term. The Concessionaire may enter into all such transactions, and may become party to the related debt obligations that may be evidenced or secured by the Finance Documents.’ Through the agreement, the Government of Sierra Leone granted the Concessionaire ‘a first ranking Security over all Port Development Levy Fees and New Port Assets.’ The concession agreement defines the ‘New Port’ as ‘four (4) Berths, and container, bulk Cargo or vehicle handling facilities (including quay walls and other infrastructure and superstructure and all fixtures, fittings and machinery, apparatus, equipment and any other moveable assets of any nature), navigation and navaid facilities, storage yards or warehouse, or any ancillary or auxiliary works relating to such Berths to be developed and constructed by the Concessionaire at the Queen Elizabeth II Quay in Freetown Siena Leone’; ‘New Port Assets’ as ‘any and all machinery and equipment attached to the land within the Exclusive Area and all movable assets (tangible or intangible) of the Concessionaire in connection with the New Port’; the ‘Existing Port Development Levy Fee’ as ‘the fees charged by the Concessionaire to the Existing Port Carriers in connection with the use of the Existing Port by the Existing Port Carriers in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Existing Port Development Levy Fee Act; the ‘New Port Development Levy Fee’ as the fee charged by the Concessionaire to the New Port Carriers in connection with the transhipment of containers, bulk Cargos or vehicles at the New Port by are New Port Carriers in accordance with the term of this Agreement and the New Port Development Levy Fee Act’; ‘Port Development Levy Fees’ as ‘the Existing Port Development Levy Fee and the New Port Development Levy Fee’; and ‘Security’ as ‘mortgage, charge, pledge, lien, or other security interest securing any obligation of any Person or any other agreement or arrangement having a similar effect.’ The Government of Sierra Leone granted the Concessionaire ‘a first ranking Security over all Port Development Levy Fees and New Port Assets’. The Concession Agreement also specifies that the lenders all have security over the ‘insurance proceeds until all sums due and owing by the Concessionaire to the Finance Parties shall have been paid in full.’9.

In 2018, the implementation of the project was reportedly halted (at least temporarily) after reports emerged that the legal entity responsible for the project—National Port Development (SL) Ltd.—was owned by Israeli businessman who had generously contributed to the President of Sierra Leone’s reelection campaign during the previous year. The IMF also sounded the alarm after learning that Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee in support of a syndicated loan, which placed an extraordinarily large contingent liability (worth 15% of the country’s GDP) on the government’s books.",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,General Infrastructure,Project focuses on port infrastructure expansion and upgrades without clear environmental or energy transition impacts,"Port expansion and upgrading project, construction of new terminals and yards, general infrastructure focus"

The MOU indicated that China Eximbank was willing, in principle, to lend as much as $248 million to ADM for the project. According to the MOU, China International Water & Electric Corporation (CWE) and China Overseas Engineering Group (COVEC) would be responsible for the construction of several segments of the expressway.  The Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) also agreed to contribute KD 55 million and EUR 220 million, respectively, for the project.    The purpose of the project was to construct a two-way, four-lane, 173 km expressway from Berrechid to Beni Mellal that runs straight through the Atlas Mountains. The expressway would run parallel to highway N11 and it was designed to relieve traffic on highway N11. The Berrechid–Beni Mellal Expressway Construction Project consisted of five sections. The first section between Berrechid and Ben Ahmed (38.6 km) was built by CWE. It originates on the existing Casablanca-Settat motorway north of Berrechid. It then bypasses the city of Morjana (PK 3) from the south and passes north of the Mbarkine region. It crosses the RP 3602 and the RP3625 at the level of the Oulad Sghir locality. It then crosses, in Lourarga, the RP3606 and bypasses the mountainous area of ​​Oulad Amar to the north before crossing the RR305 at Oulad Damar (PK 35). The second section, between Ben Ahmed and Khouribga (38.5 km) and the third section between Khouribga and Oued Zem (33 km), was built by four local Moroccan contractors: Société Internationale De Travaux Maroc (SINTRAM), LRN, Seprob and the Société Nouvelle Des Conduites d'Eau (SNCE). The fourth section between Oued Zem and Kasba Tadla (40 km) was built by a Moroccan contractor, Houar. The fifth section, between Kasba Tadla and Beni Mellal (22 km) was built by COVEC.   In 2011, China Eximbank and ADM signed a $184 million buyer's credit loan agreement for 38.6 km Berrechid-Ben Ahmed Section of Berrechid–Beni Mellal Expressway Construction Project (i.e. the first section). This loan carried an interest rate of 2%. However, its grace period and maturity length are unknown. The borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $216 million commercial (EPC) contract with CWE. It also agreed to repay the loan with toll road revenue. CWE was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on April 12, 2010. However, the project did not commence until April 16, 2010. It ultimately took 63 months to complete. The road was officially opened to traffic on July 16, 2015.   With traffic estimated at 3,700 vehicles per day (as of 2018), the Berrechid–Beni Mellal (A4) Expressway serves the cities of Ben Ahmed, Khouribga, Oued Zem, Bejaad and Kasba Tadla. It includes 7 junctions and 3 bridges across the Oum Errabiaa, Oued Derna and Oued Oum Errabia Bouqroum rivers as well as 28 underground and aerial passages.","1.

Although the February 7, 2011 MOU indicated that China Eximbank was willing, in principle to lend as much $248 million to ADM for the project, it is unclear if China Eximbank ever issued a loan for the fifth section (Kasba Tadla-Beni Mellal) of the Berrechid–Beni Mellal (A4) Expressway Construction Project, which was implemented by COVEC. This issue merits further investigation.3. Given that the borrower was to use the proceeds of the China Eximbank loan for the 38.6 km Berrechid-Ben Ahmed Section of Berrechid–Beni Mellal (A4) Expressway Construction Project to finance 85% of the cost of the commercial contract with CWE, it is possible (and even likely) that this loan took the form of a preferential buyer’s credit. However, AidData has not yet confirmed that this is the case. This issue also merits further investigation.","# Sector
