Following the signing of the framework agreement, on September 28, 2007, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola.  The MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility, was designed to finance 100 projects via individual loan agreements (ILAs). The MLFA was split between a $1.0 billion phase I facility and a $1.0 billion phase II facility.  Availability of the phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA was a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank could conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts. ILAs approved through the MLFA carried the following estimated borrowing terms: an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR 3 plus a 1.5% margin, a 13.75 maturity, a 1.25 year grace period, a management fee of 0.3%, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections. The process was managed by an office in the Angolan Ministry of Finance -- known as Gabinete de Apoio Técnico (GAT) -- that was specifically created to manage the MLFA with China Eximbank.  On September 28, 2007, China Eximbank and the Government of Angola signed a $44,300,000 buyer’s credit loan agreement under the 2007 MLFA for the 1,500 Vehicles Acquisition Project. The proceeds of the subsidiary loan were used to partially finance a $57,000,000 commercial contract with an unidentified firm. The purpose of this project was to facilitate the acquisition of 1,500 cars.  As of June 20, 2008, several clauses in the commercial contract were being altered at the request of the Angolan Government.  The project was reportedly completed, but its precise implementation start and end dates are unknown.","1. In the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020, it identifies this loan as having a face value of $57 million (equivalent to the value of the commercial contract). AIdData relies on the face value of the loan ($44,300,000) that is reported in Dr. Lucy Corkin’s book (see ''UNCOVERING AGENCY: ANGOLA’S MANAGEMENT OF RELATIONS WITH CHINA””).2. In July 2020, AidData asked Dr. Lucy Corkin, a leading expert on Chinese lending to Angola, whether the second, third, and fourth master loan facility agreements (MLFAs) that the Angolan Government signed with China Eximbank in 2007 and 2009 were structured as a buyer’s credit loans like the first MLFA that the Angolan Government signed with China Eximbank in 2004. Dr. Corkin noted that the second, third and fourth MLFAs were treated more like ceiling increases to the initial facility. Therefore, for the time being, AidData categorizes the second, third, and fourth MLFAs as buyer's credit loans.3. AidData considers this loan to be collateralized in a de facto sense. The cash deposited by the Angolan Ministry of Finance into a bank account controlled by China Eximbank is, for all intents and purposes, a source of collateral. This is true even if the lender does not have a formal security interest in the account.4.  The 2003 framework agreement (中华人民共和国商务部与安哥拉共和国财政部关于两国经贸合作特殊安排的框架协议) specified that Sinosure would be signing relevant agreements with the Government of Angola.

China Eximbank provides $49.12 million preferential buyer’s credit for Erdenet Thermal Power Plant 35 MW Generator Installation Project (Linked to Project ID#49148)

# Description
On November 10, 2015, China Eximbank and the Government of Mongolia signed a general loan agreement regarding the utilization of a $1 billion preferential buyer's credit (PBC) loan for various projects (captured via Umbrella Project ID#49148). Under the terms of the general loan agreement, all subsidiary (individual) loan agreements for specific projects carry identical borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0% management fee, and a 0.25% commitment fee. Then, on April 9, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Mongolia signed a subsidiary PBC agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC 2018 (13) TOTAL NO. (470)] worth $49,120,000 for the 35MW Erdenet Thermal Power Plant Expansion Project. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 95% of the cost of a $51.8 million commercial (EPC) contract between Mongolia’s Ministry of Energy, China Energy Engineering Group Hunan Power Construction Co., Ltd, and Hunan Industrial Equipment Installation Co., Limited, which was signed on January 17, 2017.  The remaining 5% of the commercial contract cost was to be directly funded by the Government of Mongolia.   The purpose of the project was to expand the Erdenet Thermal Power Plant (Эрдэнэт ДЦС or Эрдэнэтская ТЭЦ or Эрдэнэтийн дулааны цахилгаан станцын) by installing a 35MW turbine generator with a CC-50 engine, refurbishing chemical and water purification facilities, constructing a water-cooling tower, and building a 110 kV overhead transmission line (measuring 3 km in length) and substation. This power plant is located in Erdenet, capital of Mongolia's northern province of Orkhon. Upon completion, this project was expected to increase the power plant's electricity production two-fold (from 36MW to 71MW).   A groundbreaking ceremony took place on March 22, 2019 and construction originally expected to conclude by the end of 2019. However, a project completion and power plant commissioning ceremony did not take place until September 3, 2021.",TRUE,NA,BROWN,HIGH,Other Energy (Fossil Fuels),"Project focuses on expanding a thermal power plant, which is primarily fossil fuel-based energy generation","35MW turbine generator installation at Erdenet Thermal Power Plant, expected to double electricity production from 36MW to 71MW"

According to the terms of the agreement, CREC and Sinohydro would be granted a 68 percent stake in a new joint venture (JV) named the Sino–Congolais des Mines (Sicomines SARL), and a Congolese parastatal called Générale des Carrières et des Mine SARL (Gécamines SARL) would own the other 32 percent. In exchange, the CREC and Sinohydro would provide the Government of the DRC with turnkey public infrastructure projects (worth $6.56 billion) financed by China Eximbank. The terms of lending were not identified in the “protocol d’accord”.  Then, on April 22, 2008, a “convention de collaboration” (Chinese name: 关于刚果民主共和国矿业开发和基础设施建设的合作协议) was signed by the Government of the DRC and Sinohydro (on behalf of Sicomines). It specified that two tranches of infrastructure financing—reportedly worth $3 billion each—would be disbursed and that subsidiary loans approved under the first tranche and second tranche would carry the following terms: a 25-year maturity and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 100 basis points (or 3.839% at the time of the agreement). The proceeds from these loans would be disbursed to the Chinese contractors responsible for individual infrastructure projects.  The April 2008 agreement specified that ownership of the Sicomines joint venture was allocated such that CREC holds 43% ownership of the joint venture, Sinohydro holds 25%, Gécamines holds 20%, and a Mr. Gilbert Kalam Babanika (who was eventually appointed as deputy head of Sicomines) holds 12%. On June 28, 2008, an amendment to the agreement was signed, which change the ownership allocation to CREC: 28%, Sinohydro: 20%, China Metallurgical Group Corporation: 20%, Gécamines: 20%, Mr. Gilbert Kalam Babanika: 12%. On September 11, 2008, a second amendment was signed, which further changed the ownership allocation to CREC: 33%, Sinohydro: 30%, Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt: 5%, Gécamines: 20%, Mr. Gilbert Kalam Babanika: 12%.  Project ID#450 provides a list of the infrastructure projects and subsidiary loans that have been approved to date. Additionally, as part of the April 22, 2008 “convention de collaboration,” it was reported that the Chinese company consortium were to provide 2.9 billion USD in loans to cover 1) 32 million USD loan to Gécamines to cover its initial capital injection to Sicomines (the total registered capital of Sicomines in 2008 was 100 million USD); 2) 50 million USD loan to Gécamines to procure supplies; and 3) to provide a shareholder loan for the development of the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi.  The $2.9 billion was financed by a $870.1 million, interest-free shareholder loan (prêt d’actionnaire) from China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), Sinohydro Corporation and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, and a $2.0299 billion loan from China Eximbank at a fixed interest rate of 6.1%. Project ID#73204 captures the interest-free shareholder loan from China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), Sinohydro Corporation and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt. Project ID#73145 captures the loan from China Eximbank. At the end of Fiscal Year 2013, Sino–Congolais des Mines (Sicomines SARL) disclosed that it had received loan disbursements worth $423,889,454. However, it did not disclose if these disbursements came from the China Eximbank loan, the interest-free shareholder loan (prêt d’actionnaire) from China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC) and Sinohydro Corporation, or both loans. CREC likely provided 422 million USD in interest-free loans, Sinohydro provided 383.7 million USD in interest-free loans, and Zhejiang Youhua provided 64.4 million USD in interest-free loans.   The Congolese government agreed to provide a sovereign guarantee for both the infrastructure loan and the mining loan from China Eximbank. Another unique feature of the April 22, 2008 agreement was the inclusion of a $350 million signing bonus from the consortium of Chinese firms. However, following pressure from the IMF and civil society, an amendment (Avenant No. 3 à la Convention de Collaboration Relative au Developpement d’un Projet Minier et d’un Projet d’Infrastructures en République Démocratique du Congo du 22 Avril 2008) was made to the “convention de collaboration” in October 2009. It reduced size of the infrastructure loan from $6 billion to $3 billion and removed the sovereign guarantee for the copper and cobalt mining loan from China Eximbank.  The sovereign guarantee for the infrastructure loan was left in place. China Eximbank was not a party to this amended agreement, which specified that if the floating (market) interest rate on the infrastructure loan (LIBOR plus 100 basis points) rose higher than the rate (4.4%) referenced in the April 22, 2008 “convention de collaboration”, an expanded consortium of Chinese firms (CREC, Sinohydro, and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Company Ltd) would assume responsibility for the additional interest payments. The profits from the investment by SICOMINES SARL in the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi would be used to repay the loans that finance the costs of developing the copper and cobalt mine and the unrelated infrastructure projects. However, nearly four years after the October 2009 amendment was signed, the Congolese parliament had still not ratified it and China Eximbank became concerned about the risk of non-repayment. In order to limit its risk exposure, China Eximbank suggested that it take over Gécamines’ 32 percent ownership stake and that the Chinese consortium’s 68 percent ownership stake be mortgaged until the infrastructure and mining loans were repaid. The Congolese government rejected these proposed changes, and China Eximbank responded by rescinding its funding in early 2012. Then, the Chinese firms began negotiating with two alternative financiers: China Development Bank and the Bank of China. In July 2013, China Eximbank reversed its decision to halt funding for development of a copper and cobalt mine in Kolwezi. Construction of the mine began in April 2013, and on November 6, 2015 the first phase of the mining project was completed. The second phase commenced on May 21, 2020.

The agreement was signed by Gabonese Finance Minister Paul Toungui and China's ambassador Hxue Jinwei. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 3% interest rate.  Also, on May 24, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Gabon also signed a USD-denominated preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement worth $300 million for the 160MW Grand Poubara Hydroelectric Dam Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. The proceeds from the GCL and the PBC were used to finance approximately $370 million of a $398 million Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contract with Sinohydro. The Government of Gabon covered the remaining $28 million cost of the EPC contract.  The Government of Gabon also issued sovereign guarantees for the two loans from China Eximbank.  Project ID#85 captures the GCL, while Project ID#73173 captures the PBC.   The project involved the construction of a dam on the Ogooué river with 4 Francis turbines capable of generating 160 MW. The dam was built in part to generate power for an iron ore mine in Belinga (see Project ID#630).  The project also involved the construction of two power transmission lines: a 15 km line from the dam site to Franceville, the country's third largest city, and another line from the dam site to Moanda (the largest manganese mining region in Gabon and in the world).  The dam is located 15 km outside of Franceville in the province of Haut-Ogooué, more than 700 km southwest of Libreville, an area where the Compagnie minière de l’Ogooué’s (COMILOG) main manganese mine is located.   Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction officially began on November 15, 2008, and it was originally anticipated that the construction process will be completed in 54 months (May 15, 2013).   The dam was impounded on April 30, 2013.  Then, the four power generating units went into operation on August 5, 2013. The dam, water diversion system and other civil works passed final inspection by the project owner on July 22, 2014. The power generator set and auxiliary equipment also passed final inspection by the project owner on August 9, 2014, effectively marking the completion of the project.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loans for the 160MW Grand Poubara Hydroelectric Dam Construction Project  may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In mid-2014, a decline in international oil prices generated sharp reductions in Gabon’s oil exports and fiscal revenues. The country’s rising fiscal deficit led to the accumulation of arrears to external creditors. By 2017, the stock of the Government of Gabon’s external arrears stood at $115 million, including arrears to China, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Israel, and South Korea. All of these arrears were successfully cleared by 2020. However, the Government of Gabon accumulated $3 million of additional arrears to Chinese creditors in 2020.  By the end of May 2021, ‘the stock of [the Government of] Gabon’s external arrears stood at CFAF 98.03 billion (US$182.1 million), including CFAF 23.8 billion (US$44.2 million) vis-à-vis multilaterals and CFAF 21.05 billion (US$39.1 million) vis-à-vis government agencies and private creditors insured with companies from Paris Club member countries and from China [ICBC and China Construction Bank] CFAF 1.3 billion (US$2.42 million). The Government's strategy for the clearance of existing external arrears consists of focusing primarily on multilateral debt, bilateral debt, insured commercial commitments and seeking agreements with other creditors prior to the IMF Board meeting. Accordingly, we will clear the arrears vis-à-vis the multilaterals. We will also clear bilateral and commercial-insured arrears as follows: (i) Austria CFAF 6.83 billion (US$12.69 million); (ii) France CFAF 11.9 billion (US$22.11 million); (iii) Israel CFAF 2.23 billion (US$4.13 million); and Spain CFAF 0.09 billion (US$0.17 million). Regarding the other commercial arrears vis-à-cis AFREXIMBANK (CFAF 7.52 billion or US$13.97 million, and commercial non-insured vis-à-vis France CFAF 0.7 billion (US$1.24 million), Austria CFAF 8.71 billion (US$16.18 million), and Morocco CFAF 1.01 billion (US$1.87 million), we contacted these creditors individually to obtain from them the non-objection agreement. The same communication was made with China to which our bilateral payment arrears are about CFAF 34.01 billion (US$63.17 million).’ Then, in 2022, the IMF reported that the Government of Gabon’s external arrears to Chinese creditors stood at $23.9 million as of December 2021 and $1 million in June 2022.","1.
