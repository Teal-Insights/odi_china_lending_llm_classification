The borrower was required to keep a minimum deposit balance of 15-20% of total outstanding loans in an escrow account. All subsidiary loans approved through this framework agreement were to carry the following terms: a 5-year grace period, a 20-year maturity and a 0.25% interest rate.    According to the Congolese authorities, only one subsidiary loan was ultimately approved through this framework agreement: a $1 billion loan in 2012 for the Dolisie-Brazzavile Section of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project (captured in Project ID#369). The loan’s (principal) amount outstanding was $1,000,000,000 as of December 31, 2019.  This project, which is also known as Phase 2 of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project, involved the construction of a 376 km road segment along National Route 1 (NR1) between Dolisie and PK45 north of Brazzaville.    China Eximbank also issued multiple loans for Phase 1 of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project (captured in Project ID#68874, ID#72780, ID#72781, and ID#72782). China State Construction Engineering Corporation Ltd. (CSCEC) was the contractor responsible for the implementation of Phase 1 and Phase 2.    The groundbreaking ceremony for Phase 2 took place on December 22, 2011. Phase 2 was completed on October 3, 2015. The four-lane, 535 km Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) was officially inaugurated on March 1, 2016.    The $1 billion China Eximbank loan that supported Phase 2 was rescheduled on April 29, 2019. Under the terms of the debt rescheduling agreement, the Republic of Congo agreed to repay 33% of its its outstanding obligations for the Phase 2 (375 km Dolisie-Brazzaville Section) of National Route 1 (RN1) Construction Project within 3 years (more specifically, by December 31, 2021). For the remaining 67% of its outstanding obligations, the Republic of Congo agreed to a new repayment schedule that involved extending the maturity the loan by 15 years (from 20 years to 35 years) and resetting the interest rate of the loan from 0.25% to to 2%.  This debt rescheduling is captured in Project ID#58340.    Around the time of the rescheduling, the Republic of Congo was facing a balance of payment crisis and it decided to concession the RN1 through a toll-operate-transfer (TOT) privatization. The concession was won by La Congolaise des Routes S.A. (LCR), a joint venture between CSCEC (70% ownership stake), Egis Projects (15% ownership stake) and the Congolese Government (15% ownership stake). As of March 2019, LCR operated the RN1 through a 30-year franchise agreement. According to Li Jiqin, Chairman of CSCEC International, CSCEC reached out to the Republic of Congo for this deal because the NR1 was left unmaintained after its construction was completed in 2016.  Under this new agreement, CSCEC is responsible for maintaining the road while the French company, Egis, is responsible for managing toll collection. The CSCEC’s upfront equity investment in this public-private partnership (PPP) helped the Republic of Congo address its balance of payments crisis. The Republic of Congo also tried to convince the CSCEC to invest in a similar TOT privatization of National Route 2 (which was also constructed with financial support from China Eximbank), but the company declined as it believed the deal would not generate enough profit.","1.
