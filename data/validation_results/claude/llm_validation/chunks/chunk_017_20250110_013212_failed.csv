58761,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides $301 million preferential buyer’s credit for N’djili Airport Terminal Construction Project,"On November 26, 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo signed a $301,098,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the N’djili Airport Terminal Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC are as follows: a 20 year maturity, 7 year grace period, 2% interest rate, and 0.75% commitment fee. The loan is reportedly secured by (collateralized against) revenues that will be generated by an airport tax (called “GoPass”). The borrower is expected to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $354,680,000 commercial (EPC) contract between Régie des Voies Aériennes de la République Démocratique du Congo) (RVA) and Weihai International Economic & Technical Cooperative Co., Ltd. (WIETEC), which was signed on September 16, 2013.     The purpose of the project is to construct a new airport terminal — with an area of ​​40,617 m2 including a ground floor for arrivals — at N'djili International Airport in Kinshasa. The project also involves the installation of check-in counters, arrival and departure baggage rooms, public areas, shopping centers, a foundation, and a parking lot (with the ability to accommodate 1200 vehicles).

By September 2020, the project design process was complete and implementation was expected to start by the end of 2020. As of December 2020, all of the necessary materials and equipment were on-site to begin construction but project implementation had stalled due to the fact that the Congolese Government had not met its counterpart funding commitment.

The two parties, who signed a memorandum of understanding in March 2021, agreed on a public-private partnership (PPP) under which QAG would shoulder the cost of renovating and updating the three airports on its own, in exchange for managing it for an unspecified length of time (perhaps as long as thirty years). Under these terms, RVA would no longer manage these airports, depriving it of the bulk of its revenues, especially of the highly controversial ‘go-pass’ tax that travelers have to pay.
