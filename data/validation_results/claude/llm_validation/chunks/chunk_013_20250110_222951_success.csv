54283,ENERGY,"[CPEC, IPP] China Eximbank provides RMB 100 million for 100 MW Solar Power Plant in Quaid-e Azam Solar Park (Linked to Project ID #50939, #53988, #54284)","Crest Energy Pakistan Limited (CEPL) is a special purpose vehicle designed to facilitate the construction of a 100 MW Solar PV Power Plant located at Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park at Lal Sohanra in Cholistan, District Bahawalpur in the Province of Punjab. It is a subsidiary of Zonergy, itself a subsidiary of ZTE Corporation. On December 21, 2015, China Eximbank, China Bohai Bank, and CEPL signed a term facility agreement with three tranches. China Eximbank provided two different loan tranches to CEPL: (1) an RMB 100 million loan tranche with a 2.65% interest rate and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#54283) and (2) a $40.81 million loan with an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 4.2% margin and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#53988). China Bohai Bank Co Limited provided a loan worth $56.19 million with an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 4.35% margin and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#54284). The $149,457,000 project was financed with a debt:equity ratio of 75:25. These three loans from China Eximbank and China Bohai Bank constitute the debt component. It is unclear how the equity portion was financed.   On June 27, 2015, CEPL signed EPC contracts with China First Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd. and MCC Ruba International Construction Company Pvt. Ltd. to build, own, and operate a 100 MW AC Solar powered electric generation facility in the Solar Park. The cumulative EPC contract value is RMB 984 million. The plant began commercial operations on July 31, 2016.   However, this project appears to have encountered debt repayment and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. On October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this “[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).","1. According to multiple, official sources, the Government of Pakistan has issued sovereign guarantees in support of all loans issued by Chinese state-owned banks for independent power projects (IPPs) in Pakistan (see https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cepk/chn/zbgx/t1735166.htm and http://pk.chineseembassy.org/eng/zbgx/202110/t20211010_9558510.htm and https://www.dropbox.com/s/bmx3w2b38o7guxm/Debt%20Pricing%20of%20IPPs%20%28002%29.pdf?dl=0). As such, AidData assumes that the loan captured in this record is backed by a sovereign guarantee from the Government of Pakistan. 2. On November 8, 2014, the Chinese Government and the Government of Pakistan signed a CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement. According to Article 5 of the Agreement, ‘the Pakistani Party agrees that a revolving account shall be opened with 30 days of commercial operation of the respective project, into which the money, no less than the 22 per cent of the monthly payments for the respective power project under the agreement shall be deposited to provide cover for the shortfall in power bill recoveries from the date of power generation of the said projects agreements subject to the condition that the additional direct and indirect expenses incurred in maintaining the revolving account would be compensated by the producers through a discount arrangement to be mutually agreed.’ Subsequently, the Finance Division, in consultation with the Power Division, finalized a mechanism for the Revolving Account (RA) with the approval of The Minister of Finance in a letter dated June 22, 2015. Then, in September 2017, the Power Division forwarded a draft Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) to be signed between Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guaranteed (CPPA-G) and power producer(s) to the Finance Division. CPPA-G subsequently executed the finalized draft of RAA with multiple CPEC IPPs. The Government of Pakistan also guaranteed the funding obligations of the CPPA with respect to the RAA, through Supplemental Implementation Agreements signed between the Government of Pakistan — through the Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) — and the respective IPPs. 3. This is one of ten solar power plants at Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park financed by CDB and China Eximbank (captured via Umbrella Project ID#50939). 4. AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate for the $40.81 million loan by adding 4.2% to average 6-month LIBOR in December 2015 (0.764%). AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate for the $56.19 million loan by adding 4.35% to average 6-month LIBOR in December 2015 (0.764%).","# Sector

In 1996, China Eximbank and the Government of Papua New Guinea (PNG) signed a preferential loan framework agreement to support industrial development projects in PNG. Then, in 2002, China’s Economic and Commercial Counsellor in PNG, Fang Zhimin, disclosed that China Eximbank had issued loans worth $18.22 million to support two forestry projects — the Veneer Factory Project managed by Heybridge Pty. Ltd. and a Logging Project managed by Fusen Industries [PNG] Pty. Ltd. — under the framework agreement.   The purpose of the 29.8 million Kina (US$ 8,567,500) Veneer Factory Project was to build a factory — located in the village of Yawasoro outside of Wewak Town in East Sepik Province — with the capacity to produce 30,000 cubic meters of dried veneer each year. The project was expected create job opportunities for about 300 Papua New Guineans. A groundbreaking ceremony for the project took place on September 25, 2001.

85359,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",Bank of China contributes to a $884 million USD syndicated loan for Tangguh Liquefied Natural Gas Project (Linked to Project ID#97811),"On October 29, 2007, a syndicate of banks (including Bank of China, BTMU, DNB, Intesa San Paulo, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., and Royal Bank of Scotland) signed an $884 million loan agreement with a trustee [HSBC USA (New York)] and Japan International Finance Management (Tangguh) Corporation — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) — for the Tangguh Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project. The loan carried a maturity of 13.6 years and an interest rate of LIBOR (October 2007 6M LIBOR: 5.051%) plus a 0.335% margin. China National Offshore Oil Corporation  (CNOOC) — a Chinese state-owned enterprise — issued a corporate guarantee in support of the loan. Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., served as the facility agent for the loan.   The $884 million loan, known as the ‘Fujian tranche,’ is ring-fenced from the rest of the project and the revenues to service it will be drawn from the 25-year contract to supply 2.6 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG to CNOOC, initially through the latter’s Fujian LNG-receiving terminal. Under the trustee borrowing structure, loans are repaid from an agreed portion of gross proceeds under identified offtake contracts. The buyers make payments directly to the trustee and paying agent [HSBC USA (New York)]. The trustee is also the borrower under the loan agreement with the lenders, and the debt service payments are made from the trustee accounts. Except as otherwise provided, the lenders look to this source of debt service for all loans, with no recourse to the project and no security interest in the project assets or contracts.   Prior to the issuance of this loan, several other loans were issued for the same project: a $1.2 billion loan from Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), a $350 million loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), a $1.066 billion syndicated loan from a group of commercial banks, and an August 2006 $1.3 billion USD syndicated term loan from a syndicate of five Chinese state-owned banks — Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), China Construction Bank Corporation (CCB), China Development Bank (CB), the Export-Import Bank of China, and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) — as captured via Project ID#97811.  The debt financing package involves a complex multi-tranche Indonesian trustee borrowing structure. Repayment of the loans is supported by revenues from long-term LNG sale and purchase agreements with K-Power in South Korea, POSCO in South Korea and Sempra Energy via a receiving terminal in Mexico.   The purpose of the project is to construct an integrated greenfield liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility — with two LNG process trains (Train 1 and 2) — on the south side of Bintuni Bay in Teluk Bintuni Regency within Papua Barat Province. The LNG plant is comprised of two main components: (i) the offshore gas production facilities including 14 producing wells, 2 platforms (“trains”), and subsea pipelines to feed gas to the onshore facilities; and (ii) the onshore LNG production facilities and associated facilities, which include two identical production trains (Train 1 and 2), storage tanks for LNG (2 x 170,000 m3 ) and condensate (1 x 120,000 barrel), marine berthing facilities, utilities, offices and living facilities, off-site camp, airfield and jetty. Design optimizations together with deferral of the airfield and associated access road almost halved the site footprint. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the project would have 7.6 million tons per annum (mtpa) of production capacity to the existing Tangguh LNG facility.   The Tangguh Liquefied Natural Gas Project took shape in the mid-1990s upon the discovery of substantial gas reserves in the area. Proven reserves are around 14.4 trillion cubic feet (TCF). The project was initiated in 1997 by Atlantic Richfield Company (a US oil company) and Pertamina (a state-owned oil and gas enterprise). In April 1999, BP Plc (BP) acquired Atlantic Richfield Company and took over its lead role. Its 7 gas fields, under production-sharing contracts (PSCs), are developed under a partnership between consortia of international contractors (the PSC Contractors) and BPMIGAS as the governmental counterparty. The PSC Contractors, led by BP Berau as the Operator, operate jointly in upstream development and LNG processing for export to international markets. In May 2003, BP approached multilateral and bilateral financial institutions to seek financial assistance together with a commitment to assist the project in implementing best practices following international environmental and social guidelines.    The project began construction following the resettlement in July 2004 of Tanah Merah village (the LNG plant site). Engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contracts were entered into with a consortium of Kellogg Overseas Corporation, JGC, and PT Pertafenikki (KJP; for onshore facilities) and with PT Saipem Indonesia (for offshore facilities) in March 2005, followed by immediate issuance of the notice to proceed to start the construction. As of March 2007, the project had achieved a 70% completion rate. The offshore facilities were handed over to the project owner by May 2007. The onshore facilities were ready for start-up in January 2009 (Train 1) and June (Train 2) 2009. The first LNG production (first drop) occurred in Train 1 in June 2009. The first LNG shipment was made on July 6, 2009 using the Tangguh Foja LNG carrier.  Following the project’s achievement of ready for start-up status in 2009, the start-up process continued until mid-2011 to address technical issues, perform modification works, and ensure the stable operation and higher production efficiency of the LNG plant. Over a 3-year period from first drop in June 2009 up to June 2012 the project had produced a total of 37.8 million m3 of LNG and 5.1 million barrels of condensate.
