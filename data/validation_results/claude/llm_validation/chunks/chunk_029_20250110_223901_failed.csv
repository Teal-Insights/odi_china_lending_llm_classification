The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. The borrower was allowed to use the proceeds of the loan to finance a $77 million commercial contract with CITIC Construction, which was signed in October 2013. This project involved carrying out airborne geophysical surveys, 1:250000 geochemical surveys, 1:250000 regional geological mapping, 1:50000 professional geotechnical engineering exploration research, 1:50000 metal mineral exploration and 1:50000 building materials mineral exploration in the northwest section of the country, and the construction of a scientific laboratory (under the auspices of the Angolan Institute of Geology) of international advanced level in Luanda, Lubango and Saurimo.   The laboratory provides 12 months of job training and 24 months of laboratory operation technical services. The purpose of the laboratory was to provide a systematic, solid and comprehensive development platform for the geological and mineral work in Angola.

While the projected completion was supposed to occur during 2017, as of August 2020, project progress was at 97% and is expected to continue into 2021.","1. This project is also known as the PLANAGEO Project and the National Geology Plan Project. The Portuguese project title is El laboratorio central del Plan Nacional de Geología (PLANAGEO). The Chinese project title is PLANAGEO项目 or 安哥拉国家地质调查项目. 2. This project should not be confused with the Geological Institute of Angola (IGEO) Project (安哥拉地质研究所工程项目), which was also implemented by CITIC Construction (under a $62 million USD construction contract) and completed in 2017 (See: '安哥拉总统为中信建设安哥拉地质研究所工程项目剪彩 and Instituto Geologico de Angola and 安哥拉地质研究所新设施落成”).","# Sector
