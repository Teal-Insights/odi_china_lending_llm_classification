It purchased 98% of the plant's assets, saving the over 100-year-old plant from bankruptcy.    In order to support the acquisition from Železara Smederevo, the Hebei Branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) provided an EUR 27.6 million acquisition loan (captured via Project ID#95965) and an EUR 50 million working capital loan  (captured via Project ID#95935)  to Hesteel Group Company Limited. These loans were backed by a credit insurance policy from Sinosure. Then, in June 2016, Bank of China extended a $600 million loan  (captured via Project ID#67013) to Hesteel Group Company Limited to support the Zelezara Steel Mill Modernization Project.    The purpose of the project was to modernize the Zelezara Steel Mill in the city of Smederevo. Renamed Hesteel Serbia, the plant now employs over 5,000 workers, bringing local unemployment rates down to 6 percent from 18 percent. In 2017, the plant was expected to generate revenue of $800 million and a profit of $20 million. In 2018, the plant produced 1.77 million metric tons of steel, becoming Serbia’s largest exporter with sales of 750 million euros.    However, the Zelezara Steel Mill Modernization Project has also provoked local controversy. According to a November 2021 report from Reuters: “a few hundred meters from the huge furnaces of the Chinese-owned Smedrevo steel mill in central Serbia, the village of Radinac is covered in thick red dust. Cancer rates have quadrupled in under a decade, and residents want the plant to clean up or shut down. Zoran, 70, a throat cancer patient who speaks with a voice prosthesis after his larynx was removed, said residents must dry their laundry indoors and use vinegar to clean the dust from their cars. ‘Water cannot wash it off,’ he said. ‘We do not go out. We do not dare.’  According to data from the Smederevo public health body, which a watchdog called Tvrdjava obtained through a freedom of information request and shared with Reuters, the municipality of around 100,000 people reported 6,866 cancer cases in 2019, up from 1,738 in 2011. The plant says it has invested 300 million euros in technology and pollution reduction since China's biggest steelmaker, Hesteel […], bought it from the Serbian state for 46 million euros ($53 million) five years ago. ‘We are all citizens of Smederevo.... Would we be working despite pollution, against ourselves and our children?’ the plant's manager for environmental protection, Ljubica Drake, said in a statement to Reuters. Three new production facilities will significantly reduce pollution after their completion in 2022, she said. It was ‘not correct’ to conclude that higher cancer rates were caused by the plant's activities, she said, adding that the disease could be a result of NATO's bombing of Serbia in 1999 during a war in Kosovo. But activists say the plant is an example of Chinese-owned industrial firms ignoring pollution standards.    Nikola Krstic, the head of Tvrdjava, an environmental group whose name means The Fort, said an analysis of the red dust in September [2021] showed high concentration of heavy metals. ‘The air in the town is far below European standards for 120 days per year,’ he told Reuters. ‘Red dust is greasy, it sticks to lungs, makes breathing difficult.’  […] The authorities in Belgrade say they are prepared to challenge Chinese-owned companies over pollution’.",1.

The first is an RMB 400 million syndicated loan agreement with a 2.65% interest rate and a 10-year maturity. China Eximbank's contribution to the RMB-denominated facility is captured in Project ID#53985 and CDB's contribution to the RMB-denominated facility is captured in Project ID#92503. The second is a $62.6 million syndicated loan agreement with an interest rate of 4.96% (LIBOR plus 4.2%) and a 10-year maturity.   China Eximbank's contribution to the USD-denominated facility is captured in Project ID#54287 and CDB's contribution to the USD-denominated facility is captured in Project ID#92501. The borrower purchased credit insurance from Sinosure for both of these syndicated loans. The borrower, ASDPL, was expected to use the loan proceeds to partially finance two commercial (EPC) contracts that it signed on on June 27, 2015: an RMB 863.316 million offshore supply contract that it signed with China First Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd. and an RMB 135.683 million onshore construction contract with MCC Ruba International Construction Company (Pvt) Ltd. The total project cost was $149.154 million and it was financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 79:21. ASDPL achieved financial close on November 6, 2015, which is typically the date of the first loan disbursement.   The project was implemented on a build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) basis and it involved the construction of a 100 MW solar PV power plant located at Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park at Lal Sohanra in Cholistan within Bahawalpur District of the Province of Punjab. China First Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd and MCC Ruba International Construction Company (Pvt) Ltd were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. This project reached its commercial operations date (COD) on May 31, 2016.   However, this project has encountered debt repayment and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. In May 2022, reports emerged that the Government of Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to Zonergy and its subsidiaries/SPVs. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 10.4 billion (approximately $52 million). Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this “[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan.
