46436,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides $385.8 million preferential buyer's credit for Kribi-Lolabe Highway Construction Project,"On May 16, 2014, China Eximbank signed a $385,808,808.60 in preferential buyer credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2014) 6 TOTAL NO. (300)] with Cameroon's Ministry of Economy, Planning, and Regional Development (MINEPAT) for the Kribi-Lolabe Highway Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a commitment fee of 0.25%, a management fee of 0.25%, a grace period of 5 years, and a maturity of 20 years. The borrower agreed to deposit project-related revenues in a special account to facilitate repayment. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the total cost ($453,892,716.00) of a commercial contract between the Steering and Monitoring Committee of the Kribi Industrial and Port Complex of Cameroon and China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd., which was signed on November 28, 2012. The remaining 15% was to be covered by the Government of Cameroon's MINEPAT.   As of December 31, 2020, the loan (PBC) had achieved a 80.6% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 40.1 billion). The loan’s outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 163.5 billion as of December 31, 2020.   The purpose of this 38.5 km (+4.5km) highway construction project is to facilitate access to the Kribi deep-sea port. It involves construction of a 38.5 km 2x2-lane highway, starting from Mboro village and running to Bibolo in the Kribi II district. It also includes the construction of 4.5 km of road that connects Kribi-Lolabe highway to the Edéa-Kribi highway (or Nationale 7 Edéa-Kribi).   China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. is the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction commenced on January 1, 2015. However, it was temporarily halted on November 26, 2018 due to (a) the failure to appoint a highway operator, (b) the failure to sign an escrow account agreement, and (c) and accumulated payment arrears worth CFA 75.5 billion. As of March 2019, the project had achieved an 88% completion rate. Then, during last few months of 2019, construction was again temporarily halted before resuming in January 2020. CHEC and the Cameroon Ministry of Public Works stated that the project had achieved an 88.14% completion as of January 2020. Then, on December 30, 2020, Cameroon’s Minister of Public Works and Minister of Finance signed a public-private partnership (PPP) contract with CHEC to finance the Cameroonian Government’s 15% of the project cost, tacitly acknowledging that the Cameroonian Government could not honor its commitment to finance 15% of the commercial contract cost due to a series of crises. The timeline for completion of the project was subsequently revised to August 2021. As of November 3, 2021, the project had achieved a 98.19% completion rate. The project achieved provisional acceptance (completion) on December 31, 2021.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Kribi-Lolabe Highway Construction Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.’","1.

35982,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides $312.4 million buyer's credit loan for 275MW Minas-San Francisco Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#93434 and #96295),"On April 10, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Ecuador signed a $312,480,966.99 buyer's credit loan (BCL) agreement (Contract No. 1410302052013210568) for the 275MW Minas-San Francisco Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project. The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: an annual interest rate of 6 month LIBOR plus a 4.2% margin, a grace period of 4 years, and a maturity of 15 years. It is backed by a credit insurance policy from Sinosure.   As of December 2018, the loan had achieved an 31.9% disbursement rate ($99,967,764.14 out of $312,480,967). The borrower made principal repayments worth $15,624,048.35 on September 21, 2018, $15,624,048.35 on March 21, 2019, $15,624,048.35 on September 21, 2019, $15,624,048.35 on March 21, 2020, and $19,229,597.97 on March 21, 2022.

The purpose of the project was to construct the 275MW Minas-San Francisco Hydroelectric Power Plant in the southwest province of Azuay and the cantons of El Oro, Pucará, Zaruma and Pasaje. Upon completion, the power plant was expected to have a maximum annual power generation capacity of 1.291 billion kWh and reduce carbon emissions by 690,000 tons each year. Minas San Francisco is made up of a 54-m-high rolled concrete gravity-type dam that generates a regulation and control reservoir, an intake work located on the right bank of the Jubones River that connects with a 13.9 km driving tunnel. The pressure pipe is developed in two sections that comprise a total drop of 474 meter. The underground powerhouse houses three Pelton-type turbines of 90 MW each.  Harbin Electric International Company Limited was the general contractor responsible for implementation. Its work was overseen by Corporación Eléctrica del Ecuador (CELEC) and Ministerio de Electricidad y Energía Renovable (MEER). Construction began in March 2012. The excavation of a diversion tunnel was completed in August 2013. The diversion of the Jubones River took place in February 2014. Then, in January 2015, the excavation of the entrance window to the head tunnel was complete. The completion of the powerhouse excavation took place in October 2015. Then, in December 2016, the construction and assembly of the transmission line was completed. The power plant’s three generator rotors were lowered into place between January 2017 and May 2017. The filling of the reservoir occurred in December 2017. Then, in May 2018, the first rotation of the first turbine-generator took place. As of August 2018, the project had achieved a 99.7% completion rate. All three power generation units were connected to the grid on October 24, 2018. The first power generation unit was officially inaugurated on January 15, 2019. The project’s official handover ceremony took place on April 9, 2021.   To date, the power plant has reportedly generated over 140 million kWh power, created more than 2,000 jobs, and delivered electricity on a daily basis to nearly 1.2 million people and 2,000 manufacturing companies. However, the project suffered multiple setbacks due to administrative and technical discrepancies with contractors and inspectors, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic.
