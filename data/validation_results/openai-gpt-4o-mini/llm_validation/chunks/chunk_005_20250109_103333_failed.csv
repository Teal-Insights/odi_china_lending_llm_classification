Then, on September 20, 2018, the Chinese Government and the Government of Guinea-Bissau signed an implementation agreement for the Bissau-Safim Motorway Project. China’s Ministry of Commerce was the source of funding and it committed $16.5 million in total.

It also carried a maturity of 15.166 years (final maturity date: June 15, 2031), a grace period of 3.66 years, (first repayment date December 15, 2019), a 2% management fee, a 1.5% commitment fee, and a default (penalty) interest rate was 1.5%. The RMB-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67041) was worth RMB 4,472,500,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage (-0.141%, April 2016) and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage. It also carried a maturity of 15.166 years (final maturity date: June 15, 2031), a grace period of 3.66 years, (first repayment date December 15, 2019), a 2% management fee, a 1.5% commitment fee, and a default (penalty) interest rate was 1.5%.   In July 2016, OAO Yamal LNG withdrew a combined 450 million euros from the euro-dominated facilities of CDB and China Eximbank. The individual amounts withdrawn from each facility are unknown. The Yamal Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project is also being financed with a $3.069 billion loan (with a 15 year maturity) from Sberbank, a $1.023 billion loan (with a 15 year maturity) from Gazprombank, a Sinosure-insured EUR 730 million loan (with a 15 year maturity) from the Silk Road Fund (captured in Project ID#67040), an equity investment worth EUR 1.087 billion from the Silk Road Fund (captured in Project ID#67068), and an equity investment worth $5.513 billion by CNPC (captured in Project ID#67069).   The project involved the construction of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant — with 3 liquefaction trains and an annual production capacity of 16.5 million tons per annum based on the feedstock resources of the South-Tambeyskoye field — located in Sabetta at the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula. In addition to the LNG plant, the project included production at the Yuzhno-Tambeyskoye gas field, and the transport infrastructure, including the Sabetta seaport and airport. The Sabetta port is strategically located on the west bank of the Ob Bay, on the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug (YNAO). Its construction was designed to allow Novatek — Russia's second-largest (private) natural gas producer — to boost its exports to China and other Asian countries to compete with Russia’s number one gas producer Gazprom.   Technip France (France) and JGC Corporation (Japan), acting as one consortium, were the EPC contractors responsible for implementation. They are among the leading international engineering and construction companies with vast experience in front-end engineering design and execution of engineering, procurement and construction contracts for LNG plants worldwide. One of their subcontractors was China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). A groundbreaking ceremony for the Sabetta seaport was held on or around July 23, 2012; however, construction of the seaport did not begin until 2013. Despite the fact that the Russian government does not have an ownership stake in the borrowing institution (JSC Yamal LNG), when the project stalled in 2015 because of Western sanctions on Novatek, the Russian government quietly injected 150 billion rubles (approximately EUR 2.1 billion) into JSC Yamal LNG by tapping its rainy-day fund (the so-called “National Wealth Fund”). The Russian government never provided an explicit justification for the bailout, but Leonid Michelson and Gennady Timchenko are major shareholders of Novatek and personal friends of Vladimir Putin. As of April 2016, construction of the LNG plant was 65% complete. LNG production began on December 5, 2016. Then, on December 8, 2017, the commercial operation of the port and first LNG train (LNG purification facility) were launched by starting loading the first LNG carrier named after the late CEO of Total Christophe de Margerie. The loading was ceremonially launched by president Vladimir Putin in the presence of Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih. Then, in August 2018, the second production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched. In November 2018, the third production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched.   Yamal LNG has commissioned 15 LNG icebreaker/tanker ships to export its gas. Each icebreaker/tanker is designed to operate year-round from the Yamal peninsula and to break ice up to 2.5 meters thick. The ships are leased by Yamal LNG from four companies: Sovcomflot, one ship; MOL, three ships; Dynagas, five ships; and Teekay, six ships.  The tankers were designed in Finland by Aker Arctic Technology Inc. and built at the Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) shipyard in South Korea. The first icebreaker, Christophe de Margerie, traversed from Norway to South Korea across the Northern Sea Route in 19 days in August 2017.  When ice precludes shipping along the Northern Sea Route, then the Fluxys terminal at Zeebrugge, Belgium, will serve Russia as the LNG port for the Asia-Pacific region. Following the September 14, 2019 attack by Iran on Saudi Arabian oil fields at Khurais and Abqaiq (Biqayq in Arabic) during the 2019–2021 Persian Gulf crisis, the United States Government imposed sanctions under executive order 13846 against several companies including Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Seaman and Ship Management Company Ltd and the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian (大連中遠海運油品運輸有限公司) which are two Cosco Shipping Company subsidiaries that are supporting LNG shipments from Sabetta. As of late September 2019, the Joint Venture TC LNG between the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian company (50% stake) and the Canadian firm Teekay is the China LNG Shipping Ltd (CLNG) which has more than one third of Sabetta's LNG ice fleet, six ARC7 LNG tankers: Eduard Toll (Russian: «Эдуард Толль»), Rudolf Samoilovich (Russian: «Рудольф Самойлович»), Nikolay Evgenov (Russian: «Николай Евгенов»), Vladimir Voronin (Russian: «Владимир Воронин») all of which are operating, Georgy Ushakov (Russian: «Георгий Ушаков») which is going to Sabetta after sea trials, and Yakov Gakkel (Russian: «Яков Гаккель») which is under sea trials at a South Korean shipyard. Also affected were five ARC7 tankers which Dynagas will supply in a partnership between Sinotrans&CSC and CLNG (25.5% stake), as well as three ARC7 tankers from a joint venture between the Cosco subsidiary Shanghai LNG and Japan's MOL (株式会社商船三井). However, these former five and later three ARC7 tankers were not directly sanctioned but US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) rules require caution to be exercised in the former. Of the fifteen ARC7 tankers operating out of Sabetta, only Sovcomflot's Christophe de Margerie was not affected by the sanctions. Although these ships had been serviced at Honningsvåg, Norway, this was to be phased out and future LNG tanker shipments along the Northern Sea Route may occur between Murmansk and Kamchatka in Russia coastal waters.  On January 30, 2020, the United States Government lifted sanctions on Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) and its TC LNG.  There are some indications that Yamal LNG Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of its lenders. In February 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued Directive 3 Under Executive Order 14024, which prohibited U.S. persons from engaging in all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of greater than 14 days maturity and new equity issued by 13 Russian state-owned enterprises and entities, as well as their subsidiaries, on or after March 26, 2022. The entities included Transneft, Sberbank, AlfaBank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Rostelecom, RusHydro, Alrosa, Sovcomflot, and Russian Railways. Then, on March 5, 2022, the Russian Government issued Presidential Decree No. 95, which required that Russian borrowers make payments to foreign creditors from ‘unfriendly states’—including most countries that imposed sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine—in Russian rubles (irrespective of the currency of the loan), unless a permission to make direct payments in the contractual currency was granted by either the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) or Russia’s Ministry of Finance. This measure made it substantially more difficult for Russian borrowers to make timely payments on foreign- and local-currency debt to certain international creditors in their original currencies of denomination. In June 2022, the Russian Government defaulted on some of its dollar-denominated and euro-denominated debt.   The fact that at least two of OAO Yamal LNG's lenders (Sberbank and Gazprombank) faced international sanctions in 2022 and 2023 likely complicated loan repayment. Poten & Partners -- a firm that advises clients that are active in the international oil, gas and shipping markets -- noted in March 2022 that that 'latest round of sanctions has left Russian LNG sector companies and the domestic and foreign companies that provide finance and services to them struggling to assess their liabilities and exposure to counterparties. [...] Providers of the approximately [$20 billion] debt package for Yamal LNG included China Exim, CDB, Sberbank, Gazprombank, Russia’s National Wealth Fund (NWF), Russia’s ECA, Exiar, with smaller portions coming from Germany’s Euler Hermes, Sweden’s EKN, Austria’s Raiffeisen, JBIC and Intesa San Paolo. State development bank VEB also provided a US$3Bn guarantee to the project. Some of the Russian entities on the financing, including VEB, NWF and Exiar are now faced with sanctions. Novatek owns a 50.1% stake, with TotalEnergies and CNPC each holding 20% and China’s Silk Road Fund the remaining 9.9%. As the operating Yamal LNG project continues to service its loans, with a core group of lenders in Yamal LNG subject to sanctions, it will complicate arrangements. Parties who have contracts with the project such as shippers, suppliers and contractors are also potentially exposed to sanctions. It puts shareholders in a difficult position over whether to try and replace sanctioned entities. When Novatek and its partners were looking to raise funding for Yamal LNG, Russia’s annexation of Crimea forced them to makeover their financing plan. Financial advisor Societe Generale, and legal advisors White & Case and Latham & Watkins exited the project in 2014 and the financing was reworked to maximise support from Chinese and Russian lenders. It focused on using euros, Russian roubles and Chinese renminbi rather than US dollars to reduce sanctions risks. In its new form, the financing was successful, even though Novatek was subject to limited and defined US sanctions. But with the current round of restrictive measures, conditions are more challenging.'","1. This project is also known as the Sabetta Port Project. The Chinese project title is 亚马尔液化天然气项目.

# Description
On April 11, 2016, China Development Bank (CDB) and China Eximbank signed a syndicated facility (loan) agreement with OAO Yamal LNG (or JSC Yamal LNG or ОАО ""Ямал СПГ"") — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of Russia’s OAO NOVATEK (50.1% ownership stake), France's Total S.A. (20% ownership stake), and China's CNPC (20% ownership stake) and Silk Road Fund (9.9% ownership stake) — for the Yamal Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project. The facility agreement was amended on April 29, 2016. The financing from CDB and China Eximbank is part of the project finance package totaling the equivalent of $18.4 billion.  The total cost of the project is approximately $36 billion and it is being financed with a mix of debt and equity. The project reached financial close with CDB and China Eximbank in June 2016.   CDB issued both euro-denominated and RMB-denominated loans in support of this project. The euro-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67064) was worth EUR 5,057,800,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR (-0.141%, April 2016) plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage. It also carried a maturity of 15.166 years (final maturity date: June 15, 2031), a grace period of 3.66 years, (first repayment date December 15, 2019), a 2% management fee, a 1.5% commitment fee, and a default (penalty) interest rate was 1.5%.

49955,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides $32 million buyer’s credit loan for 75MW Mone Creek Multipurpose Dam Construction Project,"On November 20, 1998, China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) Technology Co Ltd signed an MoU with Myanmar’s Ministry of Electric Power on equipment supply and servicing for the 75MW Mone Creek Multipurpose Dam Construction Project. Then, on November 8, 2000, Sinohydro Corporation Limited and CITIC signed a $17.5 million contract for the provision of power generation equipment and technical support to the project. China Eximbank reportedly issued a $32 million buyer’s credit loan in support of the project. The proceeds of this loan were likely used (in part) by the borrower to finance the contract between Sinohydro Corporation Limited and CITIC.  The project involved the construction of a 75MW hydroelectric power plant and dam on the Mone Creek in Sedoktara Township (two miles north of Minbu District, Magway Division). The dam is 4,320 ft long and the embankment is 200 ft high. It has a water storage capacity of 674,400-acre-ft and can irrigate 108,000 acres. Mon Creek hydropower station is 258 ft long, 128 ft wide and 110 ft high. Three turbine generators at the hydropower are capable of generating 75MW.  The ultimate purpose of the project was to increase the supply of irrigation water, expand paddy cultivation by over 70,000 acres, prevent flooding, and generate 330 kWh per year.  CITIC and Sinohydro Corporation Limited were the contractors responsible for implementation of the project. The project was completed on December 29, 2004.","1. This project is also known as the Mone Chaung Hydropower Project, the 3x25MW Mon Creek Multipurpose Dam Construction Project, and the Mon Creek Hydro Power Station Project. The Chinese project title is 孟河水电站.2.

# Title
China Eximbank provides $32 million buyer’s credit loan for 75MW Mone Creek Multipurpose Dam Construction Project

# Description
On November 20, 1998, China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) Technology Co Ltd signed an MoU with Myanmar’s Ministry of Electric Power on equipment supply and servicing for the 75MW Mone Creek Multipurpose Dam Construction Project. Then, on November 8, 2000, Sinohydro Corporation Limited and CITIC signed a $17.5 million contract for the provision of power generation equipment and technical support to the project. China Eximbank reportedly issued a $32 million buyer’s credit loan in support of the project. The proceeds of this loan were likely used (in part) by the borrower to finance the contract between Sinohydro Corporation Limited and CITIC.  The project involved the construction of a 75MW hydroelectric power plant and dam on the Mone Creek in Sedoktara Township (two miles north of Minbu District, Magway Division). The dam is 4,320 ft long and the embankment is 200 ft high. It has a water storage capacity of 674,400-acre-ft and can irrigate 108,000 acres. Mon Creek hydropower station is 258 ft long, 128 ft wide and 110 ft high. Three turbine generators at the hydropower are capable of generating 75MW.  The ultimate purpose of the project was to increase the supply of irrigation water, expand paddy cultivation by over 70,000 acres, prevent flooding, and generate 330 kWh per year.  CITIC and Sinohydro Corporation Limited were the contractors responsible for implementation of the project. The project was completed on December 29, 2004.

The GCL carried the following terms: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 1% service charge (or management fee), and a 0.5% commitment fee.   This project involves the construction of a 92 km, 7-meter-wide double-lane road segment between Ha Mpiti and Sehlabathebe (Sehlaba-Thebe). More specifically, it will connect the highlands of Qacha’s Nek, Thaba Tseka and Mokhotlong with the lowlands and continue onward to the Sehlabathebe National Park. Anhui Construction Engineering Group and Qingjian Group Co., Ltd (CNQC) are the contractors responsible for implementation.   A groundbreaking ceremony took place on December 6, 2018. However, this project has encountered major implementation delays and provoke local protests and controversy. Local residents are reportedly upset because of concerns about not being compensated (sufficiently) for their loss of land, houses, pastures and livelihoods. During the project’s construction period, it was expected that xx Basotho would be employed. However, local residents have raised concerns about CNQC’s alleged failure to recruit local labor for unskilled work. Local businesses that hoped to serve as subcontractors and suppliers to CNQC have also registered concern.   One businessman, Mpota Moiloa, said he had gone out of his way to protect CNQC when it was sued by a local for quarrying sand on his site without a license. He told a local newspaper that “I have been operating a hardware shop since 2000. I have also been mining sand since 1991.” “I am currently entangled in a lawsuit with a fellow local after Qingjing asked me to step in and assume responsibility on their behalf on the grounds that they would be [penalized] more as a foreign concern. They said they would repay me with [favors] when it came to the awarding of tenders. But when I asked to supply them with cement, they told me to join the queue of those who had applied to be tenderers. They said if they considered my tender, they would want me to sell them a bag of cement for only M95. Mind you we buy a bag of cement for M97 in Matatiele (across the border in South Africa). I refused and they said they would not do business with me. They now buy from local Chinese dealers and when they do not have any stock, they go to other Chinese dealers in Mohale’s Hoek. We had hoped we would benefit from the road construction in our area but we are suffering. My business is falling apart.”   One local chief, ‘Malireko Sehahle, said CNQC had not fulfilled any of the promises it made to the villagers when it began work on the project: “When the construction work started, we sat down with [CNQC] to discuss how the community would benefit or be compensated for the loss of fields. Among other things, the community wanted water tanks in exchange for quarrying by the Chinese contractor. I noticed that the contractor never objected to any of the community’s demands and promised to [fulfill] them. But to date, they have not done anything to the benefit of the villagers. I think the problem is that we never asked them to sign any document where they committed to anything. It was just a verbal agreement.”   Then, in May 2021, Basotho employees of CNQC went on strike, claiming that their concerns and complaints had gone unanswered. Robert Mokhahlane, Secretary-General of the Construction Mining, Quarrying and Allied Workers Union (CMQ), told a local news outlet that the CNQC workers — who are also members of CMQ — went on strike following two unanswered petitions from the workers union. Among other complaints, Robert Mokhahlane said workers were being underpaid, and expelled from work whenever their employer wished to do so without any disciplinary hearing as dictated by the labor code order of 1992. He also said that “workers are […] punished for stolen equipment without any proof and investigations on who really stole it. They have their salaries cut without having any word with them, while those Chinese are also stealing from the company themselves.” He also told a local news outlet that that workers’ salaries have a pay-as-you-earn deduction, but the tax collection was not being remitted to Lesotho Revenue Authority by CNQC. He said that “what made us realize this is the fact that workers are never given payslips to know more about their salary details.” He further noted that complaints during the first week after the Easter break when workers demanded to be paid their owed salaries that were never paid from a Covid-19 induced lockdown In January 2021.

The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown.   The purpose of the project was to build and acquire the world's first floating LNG (FLNG) storage facility. The contractors responsible for the construction of this floating LNG storage facility were Wison (Nantong) Heavy Industry Co., Ltd. and Wison Offshore Engineering Co., Ltd. The FLNG ordered by EXMAR was to be the world’s first floating natural gas liquefaction unit. It was expected to have the functions of natural gas processing, liquefaction and storage, and represents the new generation of offshore units. The unit, which was 95% complete as of March 2015, was originally expected to serve as the gas project of Pacific Rubiales Energy, which is the second biggest oil and gas company of Colombia.  However, in March 2016, Exmar and Pacific Exploration & Production (PEP) agreed to terminate a 15-year tolling agreement (liquefaction and storage agreement) because PEP was facing a possible Chapter 11 filing (bankruptcy). Miguel de Potter, Exmar’s CFO, told a media outlet that the contract termination would limit his company’s exposure to a possible bankruptcy filing by PEP. 'Looking at the latest press releases, we have a fair chance to see that they will default on their [loan] covenant and will sometime end up in a Chapter 11 situation. By terminating the contract, we can open up the vessel to other opportunities,' Potter said. In March 2016, Exmar put out a press release, which said that '[s]ince the execution of the tolling agreement, the domestic natural gas market in Colombia and international LNG market have changed substantially making the liquefaction of LNG in Colombia no longer economic for PEP.' During 2016, the export buyer’s credit agreement with ICBC was also cancelled.  Then, on July 27, 2017, Exmar announced that it had taken delivery of the CFLNG from Wison Offshore & Marine in the People’s Republic of China. The CFLNG consists of a 500,000 tons per year floating liquefaction plant with 16,000 m3 of LNG storage and will remain moored in Wison Shipyard. Then, in August 2018, Exmar agreed to deploy CFLNG as a pilot production system for LNG export in Bahía Blanca, Argentina. A contract was signed by Exmar and the Argentinian Oil and Gas Company (YPF S.A.) on November 20, 2018 and the Caribbean FLNG became the Tango FLNG. Site specific modification and reactivation works were carried out in China, where the Tango FLNG unit was laid up. It was loaded onto a semi-submersible heavy lift vessel (HLV) close to Shanghai in December 2018. In parallel, gas treatment and compression equipment was sourced and procured, and modifications to the jetty were completed. The unit arrived in Bahía Blanca in February 2019. After mooring up, commissioning activities were started, ultimately resulting in the successful delivery of a first LNG cargo on June 6, 2019.  Shortly after the cancellation of the ICBC agreement, Exmar entered into negotiations with Bank of China (BoC). Following the signature of a term sheet in November 2016 with BoC and the approval of terms by the latter’s credit committees in December 2016 and January 2017, Exmar finalized the documentation required to enable parties to sign the credit agreement. The final credit agreement with BoC was subject to the approval of the credit insurer, Sinosure. Exmar originally expected this approval to be available by mid-April 2017. Ultimately, at the end of June 2017, EXPORT Lng Limited -- a 100% subsidiary of EXMAR NV -- signed a $200 million loan agreement with Bank of China (Boc) and Deutsche Bank for the financing of the TANGO FLNG (captured via Project ID#88167). This loan, which was insured by Sinosure, was fully disbursed (drawn down) as of July 27, 2017. The agreement with BoC provides a repayment period of 12 years and the loan bears interest at a rate of six-month LIBOR plus a 3% margin. The yearly estimated debt service amounts to $21.3 million. All obligations of the borrower are guaranteed by EXMAR NV (“guarantor”). There is a requirement for the owner to deposit an amount of $66 million in an escrow account (debt service reserve account).  On February 26, 2020, Bank of China released $40 million from the debt service reserve account. The relaxation of the cash collateral followed the steady operational results of the TANGO FLNG since September 2019, under the 10-years’ charter with YPF S.A. The $40 million was partially allocated to the repayment of the bridge loans and to cover Exmar's capital commitments. TANGO FLNG was performing 20% above its designed capacity in Argentina until May 2020. Since its arrival in 2019 at the Bahia Blanca terminal in Argentina up to May 2020, TANGO FLNG delivered five shipments or 624,000 m³ of LNG to its customer (YPF S.A.) with an availability of 99%.  However, the Argentinian Oil and Gas Company (YPF S.A.) invoked an alleged force majeure during the COVID-19 crisis, stopping all payments to Exmar. The dispute was referred to arbitration and ultimately YPF S.A. and Exmar came to a settlement whereby the 10-year contract for the TANGO FLNG was terminated. YPF S.A. is responsible for paying Exmar a cancellation fee worth $150 million payable over a period of 18 months, with payments secured. The balance of the settlement amount is payable by YPF S.A. in 13 monthly installments backed by a financial security issued by an investment grade counterparty.  Meanwhile, the TANGO FLNG unit has been demobilized from Argentina and stationed in a sheltered location in Uruguay. Since the effective termination of the contract with YPF S.A. in October 2020, marketing is in full swing and, given its status as a fully-proven facility, there is a healthy interest from the market for the redeployment of TANGO FLNG.

Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility,  carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections. The process was managed by an office in the Angolan Ministry of Finance -- known as Gabinete de Apoio Técnico (GAT) -- that was specifically created to manage the MLFA with China Eximbank.  In February 2005, China Eximbank and the Government of Angola signed a $190,515,690.59 subsidiary buyer’s credit loan agreement under the November 2003 MLFA for the 357 km Quifangondo-Caxito-Uige-Negage Highway Rehabilitation Project (as captured via Project ID#34853).  The proceeds of this loan were used to partially finance a $211,684,100.65 commercial contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), which was signed on February 8, 2005.  Then, on July 19, 2007, China Eximbank entered into another $500 million MLFA with the Government of Angola (captured via Project ID#34030). The MLFA was meant to finance 'complementary actions' to the 2004 MLFA (captured via Project ID#42029).  The 2007 MLFA facility financed a total of 18 contracts, which supported projects originally undertaken through the 2004 MLFA.  ILAs approved through the 2007 MLFA carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee. Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co.

The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  On July 19, 2007, the Government of Angola also received a supplementary $50,702,850.00 buyer's credit loan from China Eximbank under the July 2007 MLFA for 'complementary actions' related to the 357 km Quifangondo-Caxito-Uige-Negage Highway Rehabilitation Project (as captured via Project ID#66). The proceeds of the loan were used to partially finance a supplementary commercial contract with CRBC worth $56,336,500.00.  The purpose of the project, which employed 1336 Angolan workers and 367 Chinese workers, was the rehabilitation of a 357 km highway between Quifangondo and Negage via Caxito and Uige. The starting point of the road is in the town of Kifangondo, a northern suburb of Luanda City.  It extends northward through the city of Caxito, the capital of Bengo Province and the city of Uige, the capital of Uige Province.  The road terminates in the city of Negage, an important agricultural town within Uige Province.  The contract supporting the project went into effect on December 13, 2005 and the originally expected project handover date was June 30, 2008.

92628,ENERGY,"[CPEC, IPP] China Eximbank contributes to $1.43 billion syndicated loan for 1320MW Thar Block-1 Integrated Coal Mine and Power Project (Linked to Project ID#54013, 92627, 92628)","On April 20, 2015, Shanghai Electric Group Company Limited (SEGCL) and Sino Sindh Resources (Pvt.) Ltd (SSRL or (華信資源有限責任 公司) — a subsidiary of Global Mining (China) that was awarded a 30-year mining lease for Thar Coalfield Block I in October 2011— signed a cooperation framework agreement. Following the signing of this agreement, the two parties sought to establish an arrangement for the supply of coal to satisfy the coal consumption needs of a 1320 MW (2 x 660MW) coal-fired power plant project at Thar Coal Block-1 within Thar District and the Province of Sindh. As part of this deal, SSRL and SEGCL also entered into a coal supply agreement, in which SSRL will extract coal and supply it to China Power International (CPI). The mine is eventually expected to reach 20 million tons per year, which will be used for additional power plants as well as for export. In 2016, Pakistan’s Private Power Infrastructure Board issued a Letter of Intent to SEGCL to set up a 1320 MW supercritical indigenous coal-fired generation facility/thermal power plant at the project site. To facilitate the financing, development and operations of the power plant as well as a 7.8 million tons annual output (7.8 mtpa) coal mine, a special purpose vehicle called Thar Coal Block-1 Power Generation Company (Private) Limited (TCBPGCPL or 塔尔发电公司) was established on January 28, 2016. TCBPGCPL is jointly owned by Shanghai Electric Investment (Dubai) Limited (99.9997% equity stake) and 2 Chinese individuals in equal proportions (0.0003% equity stake). The total cost of the 1320MW Thar Block-1 Integrated Coal Mine and Power Project is $1.9122 billion. It is being implemented as an Independent Power Project — as part of the CPEC initiative — and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25.  On March 6, 2020, TCBPGCPL signed a $1.43 billion syndicated buyer’s credit (loan) agreement with China Development Bank (Project ID#53674), China Eximbank (Project ID#92628), ICBC (Project ID#92627), and Habib Bank for the 1320MW Thar Block-1 Integrated Coal Mine and Power Project. SEGCL/SEPCO agreed to provide $478 million of equity. The borrowing terms of the syndicated loan are unknown. However, it is known that Sinosure provided buyer’s credit insurance. It is also known that TCBPGCPL acquired 232.32 acres of land within the Thar Coalfield Block-I and the Government of Pakistan allowed TCBPGCPL to mortgage the land to its lenders.  The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance two contracts: a $434,750,358 commercial (EPC) contract between Shanghai Electric Engineering Consulting Company Limited（上海電 氣工程設計有限公司) and SSRL, which was signed on April 17, 2019; and a $467,956,549 commercial (EPC) contract between Shanghai Electric Hongkong International Engineering Company Limited（上海電氣香港國際工程有限公司) and SSRL, which was signed on April 17, 2019. Then, on August 27, 2019, TCBPGCPL and Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (Guarantee) Limited (CCP-G) signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). The Government of Pakistan has not only issued a CCP-G payment guarantee but also a 20% return on equity (ROE) guarantee.  The purpose of the project is to construct a 1320 MW supercritical indigenous coal-fired generation facility/thermal power plant and to develop an integrated coal mine with an annual production capacity of 7.8 million tons. The power plant will consist of two, 660 MW supercritical units having supercritical variable pressure operation coal-fired tower type boiler with single furnace, extraction condensing steam turbine and inner-cooled generator. It is envisaged that the power plant will eventually be connected with the 660kV Matiari-Lahore HVDC Transmission Line Project (captured via Project ID#54013). An estimated 600 families will be displaced due to the coal mining and installation of the power plant. The Thar Block-1 covers approximately 122 km2 in the southern part of the Thar coalfield area in the Thar Desert in the Sindh province of Pakistan, approximately 380km east of Karachi. The Thar coalfield area covers approximately 9,000 km2 and is bounded by the Pakistan-India border to the north, east, and south. The 1.3GW coal-fired power plant being developed as part of the integrated project is located approximately 5km away from the pithead of the Thar Block-1 coal mine. Shanghai Electric Engineering Consulting Company Limited and Shanghai Electric Hongkong International Engineering Company Limited are the EPC contractors responsible for implementation.  Mining work on the Thar Coal Block-I mine and plant began in October 2019. Then, in December 2019, the Government of Pakistan’s Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) signed an implementation agreement (IA) with Shanghai Electric for the project. Construction was temporarily suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic. Then, in August 2020, a batch of 500 Chinese workers and managers arrived in Pakistan by a special chartered flight, which accelerated the implementation of the project. In February 2021, almost 40% of work related to coal mining was reportedly completed and construction work was also in progress on the power station. The first unit (660MW) is expected to be operational by August 2022, while the expected commercial operations date (COD) is February 2023. 4,767 people are reportedly being employed by the project (of which 1381 are Chinese and 3386 are Pakistani).","1. This project is also known as the 1320MW SSRL Thar Coal Block-I 7.8 mtpa & Power Plant (2×660MW), the 1.32GW Thar Block-1 Integrated Coal Mine-Power Project, the SSRL Thar Coal Block-I Shanghai Electric Coal Plant Project, the Pakistan SSRL Thar Coal Block-I Coal Plant Project, or the 2 X 660 MW Mine-Mouth Coal-Fired Power Generation Plant at Thar Block-1 Project. The Chinese project title is 与塔尔电站项目 or 巴基斯坦塔尔煤田项目 or 巴基斯坦塔尔煤田一区块煤电一体化项目.2. According to multiple, official sources, the Government of Pakistan has issued sovereign guarantees in support of all loans issued by Chinese state-owned banks for independent power projects (IPPs) in Pakistan (see https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cepk/chn/zbgx/t1735166.htm and http://pk.chineseembassy.org/eng/zbgx/202110/t20211010_9558510.htm and https://www.dropbox.com/s/bmx3w2b38o7guxm/Debt%20Pricing%20of%20IPPs%20%28002%29.pdf?dl=0). As such, AidData assumes that the loan captured in this record is backed by a sovereign guarantee from the Government of Pakistan. The precise loan commitment date is unknown. One source (http://cpec.gov.pk/project-details/9) suggests that the project reached financial close on December 31, 2019. Another source indicated that the project reached financial close in February 2020. Still another source indicates that the syndicated loan agreement was signed in January 2020. For the time being, AidData has coded the commitment date as December 31, 2019. However, this issue merits additional investigation.3. Thar Coal Block-1 Power Generation Company (Private) Limited (TCBPGCPL)— the SPV (project company) responsible for repaying the syndicated loan — is also known as TCB-I and 塔尔发电公司.4. ICBC reportedly contributed $358.5 million to the $1.43 billion syndicated loan (i.e. one-quarter of the face value of the loan). The size of the contributions from CDB, China Eximbank, and Habib Bank are unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes that CDB, China Eximbank, and ICBC each contributed $358.5 million (i.e. equally sized contributions to the lending syndicate).5. The Thar coalfield holds an estimated lignite resource of over 175 billion tons. It is spread over an area of more than 9,000 square kilometers in the Thar Desert in the southeastern part of the Pakistani province.6. For the time being, AidData assumes that the borrowing terms of the loan are identical to those reported in NEPRA’s approval of the upfront tariff application submitted by TCBPGCPL (https://nepra.org.pk/tariff/Tariff/IPPs/003%20Coal/Thar%20Coal%20Block-I/TRF-360%20TCB-I%20Upfront%20Tariff%208694-96%2010-06-2016.PDF): 10-year maturity, 4-year grace period, and 4.95% interest rate.7. SSRL was owned 55% by Global Mining China (GMC) and 40% by Asiapak Investments, with the remaining 5% owned by a Dubai-based company. However, in September 2018, Shanghai Electric agreed to become the controlling shareholder of SSRL.","# Sector

On March 6, 2020, TCBPGCPL signed a $1.43 billion syndicated buyer’s credit (loan) agreement with China Development Bank (Project ID#53674), China Eximbank (Project ID#92628), ICBC (Project ID#92627), and Habib Bank for the 1320MW Thar Block-1 Integrated Coal Mine and Power Project. SEGCL/SEPCO agreed to provide $478 million of equity. The borrowing terms of the syndicated loan are unknown. However, it is known that Sinosure provided buyer’s credit insurance. It is also known that TCBPGCPL acquired 232.32 acres of land within the Thar Coalfield Block-I and the Government of Pakistan allowed TCBPGCPL to mortgage the land to its lenders.  The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance two contracts: a $434,750,358 commercial (EPC) contract between Shanghai Electric Engineering Consulting Company Limited（上海電 氣工程設計有限公司) and SSRL, which was signed on April 17, 2019; and a $467,956,549 commercial (EPC) contract between Shanghai Electric Hongkong International Engineering Company Limited（上海電氣香港國際工程有限公司) and SSRL, which was signed on April 17, 2019. Then, on August 27, 2019, TCBPGCPL and Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (Guarantee) Limited (CCP-G) signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). The Government of Pakistan has not only issued a CCP-G payment guarantee but also a 20% return on equity (ROE) guarantee.  The purpose of the project is to construct a 1320 MW supercritical indigenous coal-fired generation facility/thermal power plant and to develop an integrated coal mine with an annual production capacity of 7.8 million tons. The power plant will consist of two, 660 MW supercritical units having supercritical variable pressure operation coal-fired tower type boiler with single furnace, extraction condensing steam turbine and inner-cooled generator. It is envisaged that the power plant will eventually be connected with the 660kV Matiari-Lahore HVDC Transmission Line Project (captured via Project ID#54013). An estimated 600 families will be displaced due to the coal mining and installation of the power plant. The Thar Block-1 covers approximately 122 km2 in the southern part of the Thar coalfield area in the Thar Desert in the Sindh province of Pakistan, approximately 380km east of Karachi. The Thar coalfield area covers approximately 9,000 km2 and is bounded by the Pakistan-India border to the north, east, and south. The 1.3GW coal-fired power plant being developed as part of the integrated project is located approximately 5km away from the pithead of the Thar Block-1 coal mine. Shanghai Electric Engineering Consulting Company Limited and Shanghai Electric Hongkong International Engineering Company Limited are the EPC contractors responsible for implementation.  Mining work on the Thar Coal Block-I mine and plant began in October 2019. Then, in December 2019, the Government of Pakistan’s Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) signed an implementation agreement (IA) with Shanghai Electric for the project. Construction was temporarily suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic. Then, in August 2020, a batch of 500 Chinese workers and managers arrived in Pakistan by a special chartered flight, which accelerated the implementation of the project. In February 2021, almost 40% of work related to coal mining was reportedly completed and construction work was also in progress on the power station. The first unit (660MW) is expected to be operational by August 2022, while the expected commercial operations date (COD) is February 2023. 4,767 people are reportedly being employed by the project (of which 1381 are Chinese and 3386 are Pakistani).

According to multiple, official sources, the Government of Pakistan has issued sovereign guarantees in support of all loans issued by Chinese state-owned banks for independent power projects (IPPs) in Pakistan (see https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cepk/chn/zbgx/t1735166.htm and http://pk.chineseembassy.org/eng/zbgx/202110/t20211010_9558510.htm and https://www.dropbox.com/s/bmx3w2b38o7guxm/Debt%20Pricing%20of%20IPPs%20%28002%29.pdf?dl=0). As such, AidData assumes that the loan captured in this record is backed by a sovereign guarantee from the Government of Pakistan. The precise loan commitment date is unknown. One source (http://cpec.gov.pk/project-details/9) suggests that the project reached financial close on December 31, 2019. Another source indicated that the project reached financial close in February 2020. Still another source indicates that the syndicated loan agreement was signed in January 2020. For the time being, AidData has coded the commitment date as December 31, 2019. However, this issue merits additional investigation.3. Thar Coal Block-1 Power Generation Company (Private) Limited (TCBPGCPL)— the SPV (project company) responsible for repaying the syndicated loan — is also known as TCB-I and 塔尔发电公司.4. ICBC reportedly contributed $358.5 million to the $1.43 billion syndicated loan (i.e. one-quarter of the face value of the loan). The size of the contributions from CDB, China Eximbank, and Habib Bank are unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes that CDB, China Eximbank, and ICBC each contributed $358.5 million (i.e. equally sized contributions to the lending syndicate).5. The Thar coalfield holds an estimated lignite resource of over 175 billion tons. It is spread over an area of more than 9,000 square kilometers in the Thar Desert in the southeastern part of the Pakistani province.6. For the time being, AidData assumes that the borrowing terms of the loan are identical to those reported in NEPRA’s approval of the upfront tariff application submitted by TCBPGCPL (https://nepra.org.pk/tariff/Tariff/IPPs/003%20Coal/Thar%20Coal%20Block-I/TRF-360%20TCB-I%20Upfront%20Tariff%208694-96%2010-06-2016.PDF): 10-year maturity, 4-year grace period, and 4.95% interest rate.7. SSRL was owned 55% by Global Mining China (GMC) and 40% by Asiapak Investments, with the remaining 5% owned by a Dubai-based company.

Because the individual contributions of the banks are unknown, AidData assumes equal contributions ($339,333,333) across the three members of the loan syndicate. Project ID#67350 records ICBC’s contribution, and Project ID#92199 records China Eximbank’s contribution. This loan carried the following borrowing terms: a maturity period of 13 years, a grace period of 4 years, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3.45% margin. Park Holding A.Ş., WE Soda Kimya Yatırımları A.Ş., and Ciner Kimya Yatırımları A.Ş. issued corporate guarantees in support of the loan. The borrower also purchased a buyer’s credit insurance policy from Sinosure.

While the mining area is located in Kahramankazan district, the production plant is situated within the Sincan district of Ankara Province, northwest of Ankara. It is about 35 km (22 mi) north of Ankara. The plant's mining section supplies the processing section with the trona solution (trisodium hydrogendicarbonate dihydrate), which is the primary source of soda ash. For this, trona ore, laying on average at a depth of 600 m (2,000 ft) underground, is injected with hot water through boreholes drilled, and the dissolved trona is pumped up in the form of trona solution. The plant has five processing lines. The congeneration facility produces 380 MWe electric power and 400 tons of steam. Upon completion, it was expected that the annual production capacity of the plant would reach 2.5 million tons of soda ash (sodium carbonate, Na2CO3) and 200,000 tons of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3), and Ciner Group would become the world's largest soda ash producer (Note: Natural soda ash is more environmentally friendly than the corresponding synthetic alternatives in terms of waste and energy consumption).

Then, on December 19, 2013, S. Alam Group — a Bangladeshi company that is active in the commodity trade, banking, insurance, and transportation sector — signed a deal with Shangdong Electric Power Corporation III (SEPCO III), a subsidiary of China Power Construction Co. (PowerChina), to set-up a joint venture company to finance, design, construct, and operate the 2x660 MW Supercritical Coal-Fired Banskhali Power Plant. The special purpose vehicle that was established, SS Power I Limited, is jointly owned by S. Alam Group (70% equity stake), SEPCO III Electric Power Construction Corporation (20% equity stake), and HTG Development Group Co. Ltd. (10% equity stake).  The $2.506 billion Banskhali Power Plant is an independent power project (IPP) that was implemented on a build, own, and operate (BOO) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 71.1:28.9. On December 28, 2018, a syndicate of banks — including Bank of China (Qingdao Branch) as an arranger, lender, and original hedging bank, Bank of China Limited (Singapore Branch) as a lender, facility agent, offshore security agent, and offshore account bank, China Development Bank (CDB) as an arranger and lender, China Construction Bank (Shandong Branch) as an arranger, lender, original hedging bank, Agricultural Bank of China (Qingdao Branch) as a lender, China Minsheng Bank (Qingdao Branch) as a lender, and Rupali Bank Limited as a lender, onshore security agent, and onshore account bank — signed a $1.782 billion USD syndicated buyer’s credit agreement with SS Power I Limited for the 2x660 MW Supercritical Coal-Fired Banskhali Power Plant Project. The buyer’s credit carried a 15-year maturity and an unknown interest rate. It was also supported by a Sinosure credit insurance policy and secured by (collateralized against) a share pledge, account pledge, a mortgage and debenture. AidData estimates that Bank of China contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#52792), CCB contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#98804), CDB contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#98814), and that ABC also contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#98815).  The borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to finance (a) 85% of the cost a $1.86 billion commercial (EPC) contract between S. Alam Group and SEPCO III, which was signed on June 29, 2015; and (b) 85% of the cost of the Sinosure premium and interest during construction under the senior buyer’s credit facility. The syndicated loan covered 71.1% of the total project cost. S. Alam Group, SEPCO III, and HTG Development Group Co. Ltd. were expected to cover the remaining 28.9% via equity contributions. Project ID#52792 captures the debt financing for the project, while Project ID#54275 captures the equity financing for the project.  The purpose of the project was to construct a supercritical coal-fired power plant — with two 660 MW supercritical power generation units — and a new special coal unloading wharf in Paschim Gandamara within Banskhali Upzila and Chittagong Division (exact locational coordinates: 21.970844, 91.888932). The IPP is governed by the terms of an Implementation Agreement (IA) and a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) executed with Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB).  SEPCO III is the general engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor responsible for project implementation. However, several other contractors are also involved in the project. Dongfang Electric Corporation is responsible for providing the turbine generators, while Babcock & Wilcox Beijing Co., Ltd. is responsible for providing the boiler equipment. Sinohydro Foundation Engineering Co., Ltd. is also involved in project implementation. A formal project unveiling ceremony took place on October 14, 2016, with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina laying the plant's foundation. However, project implementation did not begin until significantly later. A notice to proceed (NTP) was issued to the EPC contractor on December 10, 2018, and project implementation commenced on December 31, 2018. As stipulated in the EPC contract, the project completion date was scheduled to fall between 39 and 40 months (March 31, 2022 or April 30, 2022) after the EPC commencement date and the NTP date.  The construction of the Banskhali Power Plant has been the source of significant, often violent, controversy in Bangladesh. Villagers opposed to the plant began peaceful protests during the S. Alam Group's land acquisition efforts, decrying the displacement because of the plant's construction. Then, on April 4, 2016, 500 villagers gathered on the grounds of Gondamara School to protest against the construction of the plant, despite local authorities having banned the demonstration. The demonstration turned violent, as police opened fire, killing four protesters and wounding 30 more. Then, in early February 2017, at a community meeting in Abhaittya Ghona in Banskhali, sponsored by the Bangladesh Navy, the S. Alam Group, and local authorities, clashes broke out between pro and anti-plant factions (which were composed of followers of a local Awami League leader and Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader, respectively) that led to the death of a pro-plant man and injured 16 more. After the clashes, the Bangladesh Navy began to supervise the project site's security along the local police.  In July 2020, the sponsors of the project were fined ৳2,000,000,000 BDT for delays in the construction works and received a two-year extension to the project period. Then, on April 17, 2021, clashes erupted between the Banskhali police and construction workers at the plant, supported by local people. The workers had been protesting over unpaid wages. The resulting altercation saw the police kill five workers and critically wound a dozen more. During the protest, workers committed arson and vandalism in the construction period. Two more workers died of their injuries, raising the death toll to seven. The next month, on May 28, 2021, police arrested a local Bangladeshi engineer for posting an anti-power plant message on Facebook under Bangladesh's Digital Security Act.  One cause of the resistance to the power plant is allegations from local residents near the power plant that the S. Alam Group bought their land to construct a garment factory to increase local employment, not a polluting power plant. The resistance was reportedly so strong that the S. Alam Group was willing to shift the entire plant to Chokoria if it could not convince the locals to support the plant. Another cause of protests was the environmental impact of the plant. An analysis of the air quality segment of the project's Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) by the Helsinki-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, in collaboration with the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association and the Bangladesh Working Group on External Debt, found that the EIA was filled with false information and omitted key details, in violation of the laws of Bangladesh. For example, the EIA failed to discuss the health impacts of the plant or mercy pollution, and falsely claimed that the air quality in Banskhali met Bangladeshi standards. The conclusions of the review suggested that the low-quality of the EIA was either the result of gross incompetence or deliberate manipulation. In a June 2021 letter to China's Commerce Minister, 129 activists and 79 organizations from 21 countries, including a number of well-known Bangladeshi figures, asked the Chinese Government to withdraw financing and technical support from the Banskhali Power Plant Project based on the project's lack of transparency, violations of human rights, and environmental damage.","1.

Then, on January 21, 2016, Xi Jinping and President Sisi attended the opening ceremony of six square km expansion area of the TEDA Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone. Xi said at the ceremony that the project would bring over 100 textile, garment, oil equipment, motorcycle and solar energy companies to Egypt, and create more than 10,000 local jobs. This expansion project (also known as Phase 2) was completed in April 2019. By the end of 2020, the TEDA Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone had reportedly attracted 96 enterprises and $1.25 billion investment dollars, generated more than $2.5 billion of sales, and created more than 4,000 jobs.

1. This project is also known as the China-Egypt TEDA Suez Economic Trade Cooperation Zone and the TEDA Cooperation Zone. The Chinese project title is 有中埃泰达经贸合作区 or 泰达合作区. 2. Over 10 years, TEDA Suez held 24 rounds of negotiations with the Egyptian side and worked on to settle 33 items with different stands only for the expansion zone project. In this process, there were differences on development concept and management approach etc.  At the beginning, TEDA Suez planned to exactly ‘copy’ the pattern of TEDA industrial park in Tianjin, China, create an environment of investment similar to that of developed countries, and build a quasi-authentic international industrial park, but found that this plan deviated from the vision of the Egyptian side.",FALSE,"Error in `httr2::req_perform()` at tidyverse-ellmer-3ad1fff/R/httr2.R:106:3:

Then, on December 19, 2013, S. Alam Group — a Bangladeshi company that is active in the commodity trade, banking, insurance, and transportation sector — signed a deal with Shangdong Electric Power Corporation III (SEPCO III), a subsidiary of China Power Construction Co. (PowerChina), to set-up a joint venture company to finance, design, construct, and operate the 2x660 MW Supercritical Coal-Fired Banskhali Power Plant. The special purpose vehicle that was established, SS Power I Limited, is jointly owned by S. Alam Group (70% equity stake), SEPCO III Electric Power Construction Corporation (20% equity stake), and HTG Development Group Co. Ltd. (10% equity stake).  The $2.506 billion Banskhali Power Plant is an independent power project (IPP) that was implemented on a build, own, and operate (BOO) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 71.1:28.9. On December 28, 2018, a syndicate of banks — including Bank of China (Qingdao Branch) as an arranger, lender, and original hedging bank, Bank of China Limited (Singapore Branch) as a lender, facility agent, offshore security agent, and offshore account bank, China Development Bank (CDB) as an arranger and lender, China Construction Bank (Shandong Branch) as an arranger, lender, original hedging bank, Agricultural Bank of China (Qingdao Branch) as a lender, China Minsheng Bank (Qingdao Branch) as a lender, and Rupali Bank Limited as a lender, onshore security agent, and onshore account bank — signed a $1.782 billion USD syndicated buyer’s credit agreement with SS Power I Limited for the 2x660 MW Supercritical Coal-Fired Banskhali Power Plant Project. The buyer’s credit carried a 15-year maturity and an unknown interest rate. It was also supported by a Sinosure credit insurance policy and secured by (collateralized against) a share pledge, account pledge, a mortgage and debenture. AidData estimates that Bank of China contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#52792), CCB contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#98804), CDB contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#98814), and that ABC also contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#98815).  The borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to finance (a) 85% of the cost a $1.86 billion commercial (EPC) contract between S. Alam Group and SEPCO III, which was signed on June 29, 2015; and (b) 85% of the cost of the Sinosure premium and interest during construction under the senior buyer’s credit facility. The syndicated loan covered 71.1% of the total project cost. S. Alam Group, SEPCO III, and HTG Development Group Co. Ltd. were expected to cover the remaining 28.9% via equity contributions. Project ID#52792 captures the debt financing for the project, while Project ID#54275 captures the equity financing for the project.  The purpose of the project was to construct a supercritical coal-fired power plant — with two 660 MW supercritical power generation units — and a new special coal unloading wharf in Paschim Gandamara within Banskhali Upzila and Chittagong Division (exact locational coordinates: 21.970844, 91.888932). The IPP is governed by the terms of an Implementation Agreement (IA) and a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) executed with Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB).  SEPCO III is the general engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor responsible for project implementation. However, several other contractors are also involved in the project. Dongfang Electric Corporation is responsible for providing the turbine generators, while Babcock & Wilcox Beijing Co., Ltd. is responsible for providing the boiler equipment. Sinohydro Foundation Engineering Co., Ltd. is also involved in project implementation. A formal project unveiling ceremony took place on October 14, 2016, with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina laying the plant's foundation. However, project implementation did not begin until significantly later. A notice to proceed (NTP) was issued to the EPC contractor on December 10, 2018, and project implementation commenced on December 31, 2018. As stipulated in the EPC contract, the project completion date was scheduled to fall between 39 and 40 months (March 31, 2022 or April 30, 2022) after the EPC commencement date and the NTP date.  The construction of the Banskhali Power Plant has been the source of significant, often violent, controversy in Bangladesh. Villagers opposed to the plant began peaceful protests during the S. Alam Group's land acquisition efforts, decrying the displacement because of the plant's construction. Then, on April 4, 2016, 500 villagers gathered on the grounds of Gondamara School to protest against the construction of the plant, despite local authorities having banned the demonstration. The demonstration turned violent, as police opened fire, killing four protesters and wounding 30 more. Then, in early February 2017, at a community meeting in Abhaittya Ghona in Banskhali, sponsored by the Bangladesh Navy, the S. Alam Group, and local authorities, clashes broke out between pro and anti-plant factions (which were composed of followers of a local Awami League leader and Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader, respectively) that led to the death of a pro-plant man and injured 16 more. After the clashes, the Bangladesh Navy began to supervise the project site's security along the local police.  In July 2020, the sponsors of the project were fined ৳2,000,000,000 BDT for delays in the construction works and received a two-year extension to the project period. Then, on April 17, 2021, clashes erupted between the Banskhali police and construction workers at the plant, supported by local people. The workers had been protesting over unpaid wages. The resulting altercation saw the police kill five workers and critically wound a dozen more. During the protest, workers committed arson and vandalism in the construction period. Two more workers died of their injuries, raising the death toll to seven. The next month, on May 28, 2021, police arrested a local Bangladeshi engineer for posting an anti-power plant message on Facebook under Bangladesh's Digital Security Act.  One cause of the resistance to the power plant is allegations from local residents near the power plant that the S. Alam Group bought their land to construct a garment factory to increase local employment, not a polluting power plant. The resistance was reportedly so strong that the S. Alam Group was willing to shift the entire plant to Chokoria if it could not convince the locals to support the plant. Another cause of protests was the environmental impact of the plant. An analysis of the air quality segment of the project's Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) by the Helsinki-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, in collaboration with the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association and the Bangladesh Working Group on External Debt, found that the EIA was filled with false information and omitted key details, in violation of the laws of Bangladesh. For example, the EIA failed to discuss the health impacts of the plant or mercy pollution, and falsely claimed that the air quality in Banskhali met Bangladeshi standards. The conclusions of the review suggested that the low-quality of the EIA was either the result of gross incompetence or deliberate manipulation. In a June 2021 letter to China's Commerce Minister, 129 activists and 79 organizations from 21 countries, including a number of well-known Bangladeshi figures, asked the Chinese Government to withdraw financing and technical support from the Banskhali Power Plant Project based on the project's lack of transparency, violations of human rights, and environmental damage.","1.

Banskhali is also spelled Banshkhali.2. Several sources suggest that the Export-Import Bank of China was involved this financing this project, despite its absence on an Industrial and Commercial Bank of China webpage describing the structure of the syndicated loan that supported the project. This issue merits further investigation.3. The exact size of BOC, ABC, CDB, and CCB's respective financial contributions to the $1.78 billion syndicated loan are unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes that all 6 members of the lending syndicate contributed equal amounts ($296,666,666.7).4.

In July 2020, the sponsors of the project were fined ৳2,000,000,000 BDT for delays in the construction works and received a two-year extension to the project period. Then, on April 17, 2021, clashes erupted between the Banskhali police and construction workers at the plant, supported by local people. The workers had been protesting over unpaid wages. The resulting altercation saw the police kill five workers and critically wound a dozen more. During the protest, workers committed arson and vandalism in the construction period. Two more workers died of their injuries, raising the death toll to seven. The next month, on May 28, 2021, police arrested a local Bangladeshi engineer for posting an anti-power plant message on Facebook under Bangladesh's Digital Security Act.  One cause of the resistance to the power plant is allegations from local residents near the power plant that the S. Alam Group bought their land to construct a garment factory to increase local employment, not a polluting power plant. The resistance was reportedly so strong that the S. Alam Group was willing to shift the entire plant to Chokoria if it could not convince the locals to support the plant. Another cause of protests was the environmental impact of the plant. An analysis of the air quality segment of the project's Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) by the Helsinki-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, in collaboration with the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association and the Bangladesh Working Group on External Debt, found that the EIA was filled with false information and omitted key details, in violation of the laws of Bangladesh. For example, the EIA failed to discuss the health impacts of the plant or mercy pollution, and falsely claimed that the air quality in Banskhali met Bangladeshi standards. The conclusions of the review suggested that the low-quality of the EIA was either the result of gross incompetence or deliberate manipulation. In a June 2021 letter to China's Commerce Minister, 129 activists and 79 organizations from 21 countries, including a number of well-known Bangladeshi figures, asked the Chinese Government to withdraw financing and technical support from the Banskhali Power Plant Project based on the project's lack of transparency, violations of human rights, and environmental damage.

1. The Chinese project title is 艾萨拉姆2x660MW燃煤电站项目 or 孟加拉国艾萨拉姆2x660MW燃煤电站项目 or 艾萨拉姆项目. The power plant is also known as the Chittagong 1320 MW Thermal Power Plant and the S.Alam Chittagong Power Plant. Banskhali is also spelled Banshkhali.2. Several sources suggest that the Export-Import Bank of China was involved this financing this project, despite its absence on an Industrial and Commercial Bank of China webpage describing the structure of the syndicated loan that supported the project. This issue merits further investigation.3. The exact size of BOC, ABC, CDB, and CCB's respective financial contributions to the $1.78 billion syndicated loan are unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes that all 6 members of the lending syndicate contributed equal amounts ($296,666,666.7).4. AidData has coded this transaction as a collateralized loan because Bank of China and Rupali Bank Limited were selected as the security agent (i.e. collateral agent) for the loan.
