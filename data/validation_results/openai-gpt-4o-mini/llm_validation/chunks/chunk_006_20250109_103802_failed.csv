92481,ENERGY,ICBC participates in $781 million syndicated debt financing package for 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project (Linked to Project ID#62217 and #92483),"The Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant first emerged in a 1999 study of hydropower dam potential in the Nam Theun, Sekong, and Sesan River basins in Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). However, the ADB did not follow up on the project due to its marginal financial viability and its potentially serious environmental and social impacts, especially on migratory fish stocks and fishing livelihoods. Then, in June 2007, the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy (MIME) of Cambodia granted permission for Electricité du Viet Nam (EVN) to conduct a detailed feasibility study. The study was implemented by a consulting firm, Power Engineering Consulting Joint Stock Company 1 (PECC1), in collaboration and consultation with technical ministries/agencies of the Royal Government of Cambodia. Then, on November 26, 2012, The Government of Cambodia and Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and joint venture of the Royal Group of Cambodia (39%), Hydrolancang International Energy (51%), and Vietnam Electricity (EVN) (10%) — signed an implementation agreement (IA) for the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project. On the same day, Électricité du Cambodge (EDC) and Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Under these two agreements, Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. was granted a 45-year concession (40 years of operation and a construction period of 5 years) and it was specified that the electricity generated by Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. — through the Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant — would be sold to EDC at the fixed price of 6.95 US cents per kilowatt-hour. These agreements also specified that, after 40 years of operation, the ownership of the Lower Sesan II dam will be transferred to the Government of Cambodia. On December 12, 2012, the Government of Cambodia also agreed to guarantee the payment (power purchase) obligations of EDC and Cambodia’s Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy to Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd under the PPA and the IA.  The total cost of the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project, which was implemented on a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis, was $978 million and it was financed with a mix of debt and equity. In December 2013, China Development Bank (captured via Project ID#62217), ICBC (captured via Project ID#92481), and Bank of China (captured via Project ID#92483) provided a $781 million debt financing package (with a 17-year maturity and an interest rate of 6.5%) to Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. for the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project. The financing was structured in the 2 tranches: (i) an initial bridge financing with ICBC under a financial leasing structure (the first for an infrastructure project in Cambodia); and (ii) a subsequent project financing by China Development Bank and Bank of China. Sinosure provided credit insurance. The Government of Cambodia issued a sovereign guarantee in the event on non-payment by EDC.  The purpose of this project was to construct a hydroelectric power plant in the northeastern province of Stung Treng on the Se San River. Its locational coordinates are 13°32′59.5″N 106°15′49.4″E. The Lower Sesan II Dam is 80 meters tall and occupies a 36,000-hectare plot. The plant has eight turbines and each turbine has an installed capacity of 50 megawatts (400 MW total capacity). Upon completion, the plant was expected to produce 1.9 billion kilowatt-hours per year, boost electricity production in the country by 20%, and bring installed hydropower capacity to 1328MW.  PowerChina HuaDong Engineering Corporation Limited (HDEC) was the contractor responsible for project design. Sinohydro Bureau 8 Co., Ltd was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began in December 2013. The watergate was officially closed on September 25, 2017. The first turbine began producing electricity in November 2017. The dam was officially opened on December 18, 2018.   The Chinese banks that financed the project divided environmental and social risks control into specific segments, including pre-loan investigation, loan review, contract management, loan issuance and post-loan management. They also required an environmental impact assessment (EIA) after the completion of the project. CDB went even further by introducing a standard review procedure. Sinosure also required that the project developer pay special attention to social and environmental responsibilities -- in particular, by resolving controversies around the dam through public consultation. The project developer held several public consultations with the affected communities in line with the guidelines of the Chinese banks. In July 2015, as requested by the local staff members of the CDB, the project developer held a dialogue with 140 people representing communities affected by the 400MW Lower Sesan II hydropower plant, Cambodian government representatives at national and sub-national levels, and NGOs to discuss their concerns and other issues related to the project. The participants then paid a visit on July 27, 2014 to the resettlement site to inspect on the quality of the housing construction, agricultural land, and dam construction. During the visit, community representatives and media held an informal on-site dialogue and raised questions to the Ministry of Mine and Energy’s secretary of state, project development, and the Stung Treng Deputy Governor in charge of Resettlement and Compensation Committee.   Nevertheless, the project was affected by protests from thousands of villagers who were at risk of being displaced or losing their livelihoods. On February 13, 2014, villagers living in the dam reservoir lodged a petition to the Chinese embassy in Phnom Penh, relevant ministries of the Cambodian government, and the developer to discuss compensation and resettlement conditions in detail. On August 10, 2021, Human Rights Watch released a report about the various ways in which the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project allegedly harmed the lives and livelihoods of thousands of indigenous and ethnic minority people. The report claims that the construction of the Lower Sesan 2 dam displaced nearly 5,000 people without adequately providing compensation or livelihood assistance. It also notes that, although by community members occurred during the dam’s construction between 2011 and 2018, public officials ignored the complaints and moved forward with the construction project.","1.

The study was implemented by a consulting firm, Power Engineering Consulting Joint Stock Company 1 (PECC1), in collaboration and consultation with technical ministries/agencies of the Royal Government of Cambodia. Then, on November 26, 2012, The Government of Cambodia and Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and joint venture of the Royal Group of Cambodia (39%), Hydrolancang International Energy (51%), and Vietnam Electricity (EVN) (10%) — signed an implementation agreement (IA) for the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project. On the same day, Électricité du Cambodge (EDC) and Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Under these two agreements, Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. was granted a 45-year concession (40 years of operation and a construction period of 5 years) and it was specified that the electricity generated by Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. — through the Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant — would be sold to EDC at the fixed price of 6.95 US cents per kilowatt-hour. These agreements also specified that, after 40 years of operation, the ownership of the Lower Sesan II dam will be transferred to the Government of Cambodia. On December 12, 2012, the Government of Cambodia also agreed to guarantee the payment (power purchase) obligations of EDC and Cambodia’s Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy to Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd under the PPA and the IA.  The total cost of the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project, which was implemented on a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis, was $978 million and it was financed with a mix of debt and equity. In December 2013, China Development Bank (captured via Project ID#62217), ICBC (captured via Project ID#92481), and Bank of China (captured via Project ID#92483) provided a $781 million debt financing package (with a 17-year maturity and an interest rate of 6.5%) to Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. for the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project. The financing was structured in the 2 tranches: (i) an initial bridge financing with ICBC under a financial leasing structure (the first for an infrastructure project in Cambodia); and (ii) a subsequent project financing by China Development Bank and Bank of China. Sinosure provided credit insurance. The Government of Cambodia issued a sovereign guarantee in the event on non-payment by EDC.  The purpose of this project was to construct a hydroelectric power plant in the northeastern province of Stung Treng on the Se San River. Its locational coordinates are 13°32′59.5″N 106°15′49.4″E. The Lower Sesan II Dam is 80 meters tall and occupies a 36,000-hectare plot. The plant has eight turbines and each turbine has an installed capacity of 50 megawatts (400 MW total capacity). Upon completion, the plant was expected to produce 1.9 billion kilowatt-hours per year, boost electricity production in the country by 20%, and bring installed hydropower capacity to 1328MW.  PowerChina HuaDong Engineering Corporation Limited (HDEC) was the contractor responsible for project design. Sinohydro Bureau 8 Co., Ltd was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began in December 2013. The watergate was officially closed on September 25, 2017. The first turbine began producing electricity in November 2017. The dam was officially opened on December 18, 2018.   The Chinese banks that financed the project divided environmental and social risks control into specific segments, including pre-loan investigation, loan review, contract management, loan issuance and post-loan management. They also required an environmental impact assessment (EIA) after the completion of the project. CDB went even further by introducing a standard review procedure. Sinosure also required that the project developer pay special attention to social and environmental responsibilities -- in particular, by resolving controversies around the dam through public consultation. The project developer held several public consultations with the affected communities in line with the guidelines of the Chinese banks. In July 2015, as requested by the local staff members of the CDB, the project developer held a dialogue with 140 people representing communities affected by the 400MW Lower Sesan II hydropower plant, Cambodian government representatives at national and sub-national levels, and NGOs to discuss their concerns and other issues related to the project. The participants then paid a visit on July 27, 2014 to the resettlement site to inspect on the quality of the housing construction, agricultural land, and dam construction. During the visit, community representatives and media held an informal on-site dialogue and raised questions to the Ministry of Mine and Energy’s secretary of state, project development, and the Stung Treng Deputy Governor in charge of Resettlement and Compensation Committee.   Nevertheless, the project was affected by protests from thousands of villagers who were at risk of being displaced or losing their livelihoods. On February 13, 2014, villagers living in the dam reservoir lodged a petition to the Chinese embassy in Phnom Penh, relevant ministries of the Cambodian government, and the developer to discuss compensation and resettlement conditions in detail. On August 10, 2021, Human Rights Watch released a report about the various ways in which the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project allegedly harmed the lives and livelihoods of thousands of indigenous and ethnic minority people. The report claims that the construction of the Lower Sesan 2 dam displaced nearly 5,000 people without adequately providing compensation or livelihood assistance. It also notes that, although by community members occurred during the dam’s construction between 2011 and 2018, public officials ignored the complaints and moved forward with the construction project.

This loan was approved through a larger $145 million line of credit (captured in Project ID#67143), which reportedly bypassed Angola’s Ministry of Finance and disbursed funds directly to Chinese companies.  It was ultimately completed, but its exact project implementation start and end dates are unknown.

95921,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",Bank of China and ICBC participate in $360 million syndicated PxF facility for the Basrah Natural Gas Liquids Facility Construction Project,"On June 24, 2021, Basrah Gas Company (BGC or شركة غاز البصرة) — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of the Government of Iraq (51% ownership stake), Royal Dutch Shell (44% ownership stake), and Mitsubishi (5% ownership stake) — signed a $180 million syndicated pre-export financing (PxF) agreement with a group of eight international banks (Bank of China, Citi, Deutsche Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Natixis, SMBC, Société Générale, Standard Chartered) for the Basrah Natural Gas Liquids Facility Construction Project. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 5-year maturity an an estimated interest rate of 5%.  In parallel, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) issued a $137.76 million loan and a $42.24 million loan through its Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Program. The IFC also served as the lead arranger of the $180 million syndicated loan.  The purpose of the project is to construct a new Basrah natural gas liquids facility in the Ar-Ratawi area in the west of Basra — with two natural gas liquids trains, each of 200m cubic feet per day capacity — and expand gas processing by introducing additional NGL separation gas treatment. More specifically, the project scope has three main components: (i) the process trains, (ii) works in the immediate vicinity of the process trains, including power and water supply, (iii) four pipelines and their tie ins including a 13.7 km feed gas pipeline from BGC’s North Rumaila NGL plant, an 80 km broadcut export to the BGC KAZ facility, a 10.2 km dry gas pipeline to connect to the Iraqi gas grid, and a 17 km water supply pipeline from the Rumaila Operating Organization’s Al Nukhail Water Pumping Station. BGC gathers, treats and processes associated gas that would otherwise be flared at oil fields of West Qurna 1, Zubair and Rumaila in southern Iraq.   Prior to the implementation of the project, the capture and processing of associated gas from the upstream oil fields was limited by the capacity of BGC’s existing natural-gas-liquids plants and export infrastructure.  Upon completion, the project is expected to increase BGC’s capacity to 1.4bcf per day by 2024. Société Générale claims that the project is one of ‘the largest gas flaring reduction projects in the world, helping to improve energy access, prevent associated greenhouse gas emissions and support a more resilient, sustainable energy sector in Iraq.’ The country has vast natural gas reserves, largely a by-product of oil extraction, yet has generally been unable to put those reserves to use.  Iraq has committed to eliminate all routine natural gas flaring by 2030, but around 70% of all natural gas it produces is flared. Flaring gas is both a waste of resources and a contributor to climate change. The Basrah Natural Gas Liquids Facility Construction Project aims to reverse that trend through the development of a processing plant, allowing capture and treatment of natural gas that would otherwise be wasted. The resulting fuels can then be used to generate energy domestically, or exported in the form of liquified petroleum gas or condensate products.  China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Corporation (CPECC) is the contractor responsible for project implementation. It signed a $170 million commercial contract with BGC on February 27, 2019.  IFC’s environmental and social due diligence of this project consisted of the appraisal of technical, environmental, health, safety and social information submitted by BGC. A lenders’ Independent Engineer (“IE”) was commissioned by IFC assessing both the environmental and social aspects of the project along with the engineering and technical aspects of the operation. The consultant produced an independent due diligence report which has been reviewed by BGC, IFC and other lenders. IFC’s environmental and social (E&S) appraisal team undertook a field visit in March 2019 meeting with members of BGC’s senior management team, project teams, BGC’s corporate health, safety and environment (“HSE”) manager, environment manager and environmental advisors, human resources, social performance, operations managers and supporting teams at the respective plants and corporate and asset level security management. IFC also visited three existing BGC processing assets, namely the Umm Qasr storage and marine terminal, the North Rumaila NGL and NSC2 and the KAZ NGL plant. Complementing IFC’s appraisal visit, the IE undertook a field appraisal in August 2019 visiting the NR NGL and KAZ NGL plants, compressor station 2 and the Umm Qasr storage and marine terminals.   Project implementation commenced on or around October 15, 2019. The project had achieved an 8.33% completion rate as of December 2019.

A pre-export finance (PXF) facility is an arrangement in which a commodity producer gets up-front cash from a customer in return for a promise to repay the customer with that commodity (possibly at a discount) in the future. PXF funds may be advanced by a lender or syndicate of lenders to a commodity producer to assist the company in meeting either its working capital needs (for example, to cover the purchase of raw materials and costs associated with processing, storage and transport) or its capital investment needs (for example, investment in plant and machinery and other elements of infrastructure). PXF facilities are usually secured by (1) an assignment of rights by the producer under an ‘offtake contract’ (i.e., a sale and purchase contract between the producer and a buyer of that producer of goods or commodities), and (2) a collection account charge over a bank account into which proceeds due to the producer from the buyer of the goods or commodities under the offtake contract are credited. There are two key documents in prepayment finance transactions: a contract providing for the advance payment by the offtaker to the producer for the purchase of goods/commodities (the 'Prepayment Contract'), and a loan agreement between a lender and the offtaker (the 'Offtaker Loan Agreement') under which the advance payment is financed.","# Sector

A pre-export finance (PXF) facility is an arrangement in which a commodity producer gets up-front cash from a customer in return for a promise to repay the customer with that commodity (possibly at a discount) in the future. PXF funds may be advanced by a lender or syndicate of lenders to a commodity producer to assist the company in meeting either its working capital needs (for example, to cover the purchase of raw materials and costs associated with processing, storage and transport) or its capital investment needs (for example, investment in plant and machinery and other elements of infrastructure). PXF facilities are usually secured by (1) an assignment of rights by the producer under an ‘offtake contract’ (i.e., a sale and purchase contract between the producer and a buyer of that producer of goods or commodities), and (2) a collection account charge over a bank account into which proceeds due to the producer from the buyer of the goods or commodities under the offtake contract are credited. There are two key documents in prepayment finance transactions: a contract providing for the advance payment by the offtaker to the producer for the purchase of goods/commodities (the 'Prepayment Contract'), and a loan agreement between a lender and the offtaker (the 'Offtaker Loan Agreement') under which the advance payment is financed.",FALSE,"Error in `httr2::req_perform()` at tidyverse-ellmer-3ad1fff/R/httr2.R:106:3:

Then, on December 16, 2011, CDB signed two bilateral facility (loan) agreements with KAZ Minerals Aktogay Finance Limited — a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals Aktogay LLP, which is itself a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kazykhmys PLC (Kaz Minerals PLC) — for the Aktogay Copper Mine Development Project: an RMB 1 billion ($158 million) loan agreement (as captured via Project ID#39557) and a $1.34 billion loan agreement (as captured via Project ID#41941). The RMB 1 billion loan tranche (facility) and the $1.34 billion loan tranche (facility) were available to the borrower for draw down over a three year period. The maturity of each loan was 15 years from the date of first draw down and the grace period of each loan was 3 years. The interest rate for the USD-denominated loan tranche was LIBOR plus a 4.20% margin and the interest rate for the RMB-denominated loan tranche was based on the applicable benchmark lending rate published by the People's Bank of China (PBoC). KAZ Minerals PLC provided a guarantee for both loans. As an additional credit enhancement, the borrower pledged a $100,000,000 minimum cash balance in a charge account (collection account) as a source of collateral.  As of December 31, 2015, the RMB facility was fully drawn down. To protect against currency risks, KAZ Minerals swapped the interest basis from a RMB interest rate into a USD LIBOR interest basis. As of December 31, 2016, the USD facility was fully drawn down. Arrangement fees with an amortized cost of $15 million, were netted off against these borrowings in accordance with IAS 39. The USD facility was repayable in half-yearly installments beginning in March 2018.  The 2016 audited KAZ Minerals financial report identified the interest rates of the USD-denominated and RMB-denominated loan tranches as 5.12% and 4.33% (as of December 31, 2016) and 5.12% and 3.93% (as December 31, 2015), respectively.

AidData has used this information to estimate the interest rates that apply to these loans.    The initial development cost of the copper mine was $2 billion, with KAZ Minerals seeking to fund the remaining $500 million. The mine was eventually expected to produce up to 100,000 tons of copper concentrate annually beginning in 2015.

Under the terms of the 20-year agreement, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Iraq is authorized to borrow up to $10 billion (or an equivalent amount in other currencies such as RMB) via subsidiary buyer’s credit facility agreements with PRC banks and/or commercial contracts with deferred payment clauses (i.e. supplier’s credits) with Chinese companies (exporters) for projects in the ‘oil, gas, energy, infrastructure, communications, education, healthcare or electricity sectors’ that are ‘located in the areas in Iraq deemed safe by the Embassy of China and the Government of Iraq.’ All borrowings under the framework agreement, which is captured via Project ID#95982, must carry maturity lengths that do not exceed 15 years and they must be backed by an approved credit insurance policy from Sinosure. The framework agreement also specifies that the Government of Iraq is responsible for making advance payments worth no less than 15% of the total cost of the underlying commercial contracts supported by the subsidiary buyer’s credits and supplier’s credits.   To repay and secure these borrowings, the framework agreement specifies that a Crude Oil Sales Agreement between Iraq's state-owned oil marketing company (SOMO or شركة تسويق النفط) and an unspecified Chinese oil importer, wherein SOMO agrees to sell no fewer than 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day to the Chinese oil importer and the Chinese oil importer agrees to make payments to SOMO due under the Crude Oil Sales Agreement by depositing U.S. dollars (or another foreign currency) in a Sinosure-designated and lender-controlled bank (escrow) account (that is opened on behalf of the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Iraq to facilitate debt repayment).  Under the terms of the framework agreement, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Iraq is required to maintain a minimum cash balance of $100 million in a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) and pledge the DSRA in favor of Sinosure. Apart from the DSRA, the framework agreement refers to two additional escrow accounts: an Oil Settlement Account and a Repayment Account. All oil sale proceeds first flow to the Oil Settlement Account. Then, after deductions are made by the United Nations Compensation Commission for compensation due to Kuwait, the remaining revenue flows to the Repayment Account (so long as there is still a $100 million minimum cash balance in the DSRA) and principal and interest payments to lenders are made from the Repayment Account.   On September 23, 2019, account agreement and oil agreement annexes to the framework agreement were finalized. Then, on September 23, 2019, the framework agreement officially went into effect. Approximately 15 months later, in December 2020, a Financial Advisor to Iraq’s Prime Minister, Dr. Mudhar Muhammad Salih, told the Iraqi News Agency (INA), that Iraq’s House of Representatives would need to identify the specific projects to be funded under the framework agreement and allocate funds for these projects in the Federal Budget Law. He also signaled at the time that the Iraqi Government planned to borrow through the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure to fund the construction of school buildings. Then, in June 2021, he announced that the 2021 Federal Budget Law included $2 billion for projects to be financed through the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure, which had entered into force. 5 months later, in November 2021, he told a local newspaper that several Chinese companies had deposited $1.8 billion in an account and the funds would be used to support the construction of 1,000 schools as well as ‘infrastructure and renewable power projects’. This announcement implies that the Government of Iraq ultimately decided to borrowed via commercial contracts with deferred payment clauses (i.e. supplier’s credits) with Chinese companies rather than buyer’s credit facilities with PRC banks. On June 30, 2022, Dr. Mudhar Muhammad Salih said that ‘[t]he operations of depositing money and withdrawing from the [escrow] account are continuing for the benefit of the projects concluded within the [export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure].’ He also noted that ‘the [escrow] account is managed very carefully by the Central Bank of Iraq, and the financial operations are audited by the major international financial auditing companies.’  There are three known projects — supported by four separate commercial contracts — that are being financed under the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure: the 1260MW Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant Construction Project, the Construction of 1000 Schools Project, and the Al-Nasiriyah International Airport Renovation and Expansion Project. In September 2013, China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) and Ministry of Electricity of Iraq signed a $1,189,132,251 commercial (EPC) contract for the 1260MW Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant Construction Project. This contract was amended on November 21, 2019 and its monetary value was increase by $140 million (to ~$1,329,132,251) after CMEC and the Government of Iraq signed a financing memorandum on September 22, 2019. The estimated monetary value of the supplier’s credit for the 1260MW Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant Construction Project is $1,129,762,413.35 (as captured via Project ID#95996).   The purpose of the project is to construct an oil-fired thermal power plant that consists of two subcritical, oil-fired generating units of 630MW capacity each (‘Unit 1’ and ‘Unit 2’). Upon completion, each unit is expected consist of a boiler drum along with a boiler furnace equipped with oil and gas nozzles, and a single shaft steam turbine. The boiler assembly will feature four-corner tangential combustion chamber, along with single-hearth balanced ventilation supported by steel structure frame. The design boiler maximum continuous rating (BMCR) will be 2136t/h. Each double back pressure, impulse type steam turbine will feature three cylinders and four exhausts. The other major components of the plant will include three-stage high pressure heaters, four- stage low pressure heaters, eight-stage regenerative deaerators, apart from steam-driven feedwater pumps. The project also includes four 20,000m3 oil mixing tanks, air compressors, as well as the construction of 400kV and 132kV booster stations. The electricity generated by the power project will be evacuated through a 400kV power transmission line connecting the national grid of Iraq. The power plant is located approximately 16 km southeast of the Samara city in Salah Al-din Province on the north bank of the Tigris River (and approximately 186 km north of Baghdad).   CMEC is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, Northwest Research Institute of Energy China, SGS, the Fourth Construction of China Machinery Industry Co., Ltd., China Valves Technology, Inc. and Sichuan Railway Investment Group Co., Ltd. are also involved in implementation as subcontractors.  Project implementation officially commenced on August 14, 2012. However, civil construction works did not begin until April 2013. The project was originally expected to reach completion within 45 months (January 2017). Construction works were suspended in June 2014 due to the fact that Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) launched a major attack in northern Iraq against the Iraqi government, which led to a major deterioration in the local security situation. Construction works resumed in mid-2018. As of August 2019, 1200 Chinese and Iraqi workers were assigned to the project. Then, on November 21, 2019, the Ministry of Electricity of Iraq (MOELC) and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) signed an expanded and amended EPC contract, which allocated $140 million of additional funding for additional repair and inspection work and the construction of a new 132kV substation. On April 1, 2020, Zhang Tao, the Chinese Ambassador to Iraq, and a team from the Red Cross Society of China visited the power plant and provided on-site Covid-19 pandemic prevention and control guidance. Fifteen days later. On April 16, 2020, the boiler hydraulic test for Unit 1 took place, marking an important milestone of the project. Unit 1 began trial operations on June 2, 2021. However in late-June 2021, ISIS launched a set of targeted by Katyusha rockets at the Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant and severely damaged parts of Unit 1.  The Unit 1 boiler was ignited on May 11 , 2022, and it was connected to the grid on May 12, 2022. Unit 1 then began a 720-hour reliability test on May 20, 2022. On June 19, 2022, Unit 1 passed the 720-hour reliability test. CMEC then handed over Unit 1 to the project owner in July 2022, which marked halfway point of the implementation of the project. On August 27, 2022, Unit 2 was connected to the national grid for the first time and officially put into operation.","1.

38342,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides $405.8 million preferential buyer’s credit for Multi Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project (Linked to Project ID #52873 and #55046) [BRI],"On June 9, 2014, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, visited China and the Chinese Government and the Government of Bangladesh signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on the Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project. Then, on November 14, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed an RMB 1,950,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement and a $405.8 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project. The GCL carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a grace period of 5 years, and a 0.2% commitment fee. The PBC carries the following terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a grace period of 5 years, and a 0.2% commitment fee. Project ID#55046 captures the GCL, while Project ID#38342 captures the PBC. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the GCL and the PBC to finance a commercial contract between the Government of Bangladesh’s Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges and China Communication Construction Company (CCCC), which was signed in June 2015. The GCL had disbursed RMB 936,1890,000 as of June 30, 2018, RMB 1,557,869,000 as of June 30, 2019, RMB 1,950,000,000 as of June 30, 2020, and RMB 1,950,000,000 as of June 30, 2021. No repayments on the GCL had been made as of June 30, 2019 or June 30, 2021. As of June 30, 2021, the PBC had disbursed $165.559 million and no repayments had been made.   The purpose of the project, which is also known as the Multilane Karnaphuli Tunnel Project, is to construct a 3.4-kilometer-long, 10 meter-wide tunnel under the Karnaphuli River near the Port of Chittagong. The total length of the proposed tunnel will be around 9.092 kilometers, including a 3.40-kilometer tunnel under the Karnaphuli River with an approach road of 4.89 kilometers alongside 740 meters of bridges linking the main port city, and western side of the Karnaphuli along with the eastern side of the river. Upon completion, the tunnel will connect the port of Chittagong to the industrial area of the city and thereby relieve pressure on the three existing bridges. The total area of the project is 382.03 acres. More than 360.64 acres of land were acquired for the construction of roads and installments of utility lines.  A total of 2,275 families are affected by this project, and 1,660 were given compensation. China Communication Construction Company (CCCC) is the general (EPC) contractor responsible for project implementation. On November 24, 2015, the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) approved the Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project. Construction began on February 24, 2017.  Two years later, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh officially inaugurated boring works on the tunnel on February 24, 2019. The project had achieved a 40% physical completion rate by May 2019, including the installation of over 150 meters of the first tunnel and much of the above-ground works. Then, on July 31, 2020, the project reached a key milestone with the completion of the first underwater, after a made-in-China super-diameter slurry-pressure-balance tunnel boring machine (TBM) broke through at the Karnaphuli River east bank working shaft.    The TBM, which is 94 meters long and weighs more than 2,200 tons, was developed by the Tianhe Mechanical Equipment Manufacturing Co. It was the first super-diameter slurry-pressure-balance TBM to be self-developed and exported by China. The TBM uses several self-developed technologies, such as an automatic mud water circulation system. As of October 2021, all boring-related work was completed — after the excavation of the second tube (from Anwara end of Chittagong to Patenga end) of the 3.315-km tunnel) — and the project had achieved a 73% physical completion rate. By November 2021, the project had achieved a 77.5% physical completion rate. On May 8, 2022, Harunur Rashid Chowdhury, Project Director of Karnaphuli Multilane Road Tunnel, sent a letter to the Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA). In it, he noted that Shanghai Port had remained closed since March 2022 due to Covid-19 and the Chinese Government’s zero-tolerance policy had affected project’s progress: ‘It may be noted that […] most of the goods and equipment are being manufactured/procured from Shanghai. Therefore, the closure of the Shanghai Port is causing a delay in shipments. […] The goods and equipment planned to arrive in March [2022] are still not able to reach Chittagong Port to date. Subsequent shipments will also get affected on this account.’ In the letter, Harunur Rashid Chowdhury also asked the BBA to take up the issue with the Economic Relations Division (ERD) and arrange an extension of the China Eximbank loan availability period by six months until May 6, 2023. On May 7, 2022, Li Zheng, the CCCC Project Manager of the Karnaphuli Tunnel Project Site Office, acknowledged in a letter to Harunur Rashid Chowdhury that the delay in shipments from Shanghai was the result of China’s ‘zero Covid’ measures. Then, in June 2022, BBA announced that two sub-contractors hired CCCC to complete two project components — a management software system for BBA and the service area (east) — had violated their contractual obligations. According to a letter from Harunur Rashid Chowdhury, Project Director of Karnaphuli Multilane Road Tunnel, to the BBA, ‘CCCC was instructed to undertake this work, but they employed sub-contractors to do so.  CCCC selected these sub-contractors and is responsible for any default of the sub-contractors. […] Unfortunately, CCCC has not effectively monitored or exercised control over both these sub-contractors.’ The Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project was originally expected to reach completion by the end of 2020. However, in 2018, the project’s expected completion date was pushed back to December 4, 2022.    Upon completion, the underwater tunnel is expected to reduce the time it takes to drive from Hittagong Shah Amanat International Airport to the Hittagong industrial park from four hours to 20 minutes.",1. This project is a part of the Belt and Road Initiative and one of a series of loans captured via Umbrella Project ID#52873. 2. Karnaphuli is sometimes also spelled as ‘Karnafuli’. 3.

The TBM, which is 94 meters long and weighs more than 2,200 tons, was developed by the Tianhe Mechanical Equipment Manufacturing Co. It was the first super-diameter slurry-pressure-balance TBM to be self-developed and exported by China. The TBM uses several self-developed technologies, such as an automatic mud water circulation system. As of October 2021, all boring-related work was completed — after the excavation of the second tube (from Anwara end of Chittagong to Patenga end) of the 3.315-km tunnel) — and the project had achieved a 73% physical completion rate. By November 2021, the project had achieved a 77.5% physical completion rate. On May 8, 2022, Harunur Rashid Chowdhury, Project Director of Karnaphuli Multilane Road Tunnel, sent a letter to the Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA). In it, he noted that Shanghai Port had remained closed since March 2022 due to Covid-19 and the Chinese Government’s zero-tolerance policy had affected project’s progress: ‘It may be noted that […] most of the goods and equipment are being manufactured/procured from Shanghai. Therefore, the closure of the Shanghai Port is causing a delay in shipments. […] The goods and equipment planned to arrive in March [2022] are still not able to reach Chittagong Port to date. Subsequent shipments will also get affected on this account.’ In the letter, Harunur Rashid Chowdhury also asked the BBA to take up the issue with the Economic Relations Division (ERD) and arrange an extension of the China Eximbank loan availability period by six months until May 6, 2023. On May 7, 2022, Li Zheng, the CCCC Project Manager of the Karnaphuli Tunnel Project Site Office, acknowledged in a letter to Harunur Rashid Chowdhury that the delay in shipments from Shanghai was the result of China’s ‘zero Covid’ measures. Then, in June 2022, BBA announced that two sub-contractors hired CCCC to complete two project components — a management software system for BBA and the service area (east) — had violated their contractual obligations. According to a letter from Harunur Rashid Chowdhury, Project Director of Karnaphuli Multilane Road Tunnel, to the BBA, ‘CCCC was instructed to undertake this work, but they employed sub-contractors to do so.  CCCC selected these sub-contractors and is responsible for any default of the sub-contractors. […] Unfortunately, CCCC has not effectively monitored or exercised control over both these sub-contractors.’ The Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project was originally expected to reach completion by the end of 2020. However, in 2018, the project’s expected completion date was pushed back to December 4, 2022.    Upon completion, the underwater tunnel is expected to reduce the time it takes to drive from Hittagong Shah Amanat International Airport to the Hittagong industrial park from four hours to 20 minutes.

64786,ENERGY,CDB provides $215 million buyer’s credit loan for Vientiane Power Grid Modernization Project,"On November 13, 2017, China Development and the Government of Laos signed a $215 million buyer’s credit loan agreement for the Vientiane Power Grid Modernization Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 90% of the cost of a $239 million commercial (EPC) contract between Huazhong Power International Economic and Trade Co., Ltd. — a subsidiary of China Electric Power Technology Equipment Co., Ltd. — and Electricite du Laos (EDL), which was signed in December 2015. EDL is considered to be the project owner.   The purpose of the project is to reconstruct the 115 kV Donekoy substation (ສະ​ຖາ​ນີ​ໄຟ​ຟ້າ​ດອນກອຍ), the 115 kV Sokpaluang substation (ສະຖານີໄຟຟ້າໂສກປ່າຫລວງ), and the transmission line works (a 40 km 230kV line and a 50 km 500kV line) between the two substations in the capital city of Vientiane.   Huazhong Power International Economic and Trade Co., Ltd. is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Project implementation commenced on April 19, 2019. The project is still under implementation; but on July 24, 2021, the first station of the Laos substation was put online. The expected completion date of the project is April 2022.  There are some indications that the CDB loan for the Vientiane Power Grid Modernization Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. Laos’ gross foreign exchange reserves were dangerously low between 2019 and 2021, hovering between 1.4 and 2.3 months of import cover, and total public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt increased from 68 percent of GDP ($12.5 billion) in 2019 to 88 percent in 2021 of GDP (or $14.5 billion). According to a report published by the World Bank in April 2022, ‘[t]he energy sector, mostly represented by Électricité du Laos (EDL), accounted for over 30 percent of total PPG debt in 2021. […] EDL’s debt service obligations [were] still unsustainable [at the time], with future debt service accounting for about two fifths of EDL’s total operating revenue.’ The Laotian authorities sought and secured debt service payment deferrals from their Chinese creditors in 2020 and 2021; according to the World Bank, ‘[d]ebt service deferrals granted by major lenders in 2020-2021 amounted around 3.6 percent of GDP in 2021’ and ’[a]s a result, actual debt service payments are estimated to have declined to 48 percent of total revenues in 2021, compared to 65 percent in the 2021 [Government of Laos] plan.’  The country’s central bank (Bank of the Lao P.D.R) also made a $300 million drawdown under its currency swap agreement with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in June 2020 — when its gross reserves stood at only 1.5 months of import cover and credit rating agencies warned of a high default probability. Then, in 2021, the short-term emergency loan from the PBOC was ‘rolled over’ for another year. Around the same time, a Chinese state-owned enterprise purchased a major public infrastructure asset in Laos—a large part of the country’s electricity transmission grid—from EDL as part of an apparent debt-for-equity swap. China Southern Power Grid Co. and EDL established a joint venture known as Électricité du Laos Transmission Company Limited (EDLT) in September 2020.  China Southern Power Grid Co. purchased a 90% ownership stake in EDLT in exchange for a $600 million fee (equity infusion). Then, in March 2021, EDLT signed a 25-year concession agreement, which made it responsible for management of the country’s high-voltage transmission network above 230 kilovolts. Independent observers suggested at the time that EDL would likely use the $600 million upfront payment from China Southern Power Grid Co. to service its outstanding debts to Chinese creditors, although this has not been independently confirmed. According to the World Bank’s International Debt Statistics, the Government of Laos was responsible for making average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $232 million between 2019 and 2019 and average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $60 million between 2020 and 2021 (a substantially lower figure due to payment deferrals); however, it expected to make average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth nearly $678 million over the next seven years (2022-2028).",1.

According to a report published by the World Bank in April 2022, ‘[t]he energy sector, mostly represented by Électricité du Laos (EDL), accounted for over 30 percent of total PPG debt in 2021. […] EDL’s debt service obligations [were] still unsustainable [at the time], with future debt service accounting for about two fifths of EDL’s total operating revenue.’ The Laotian authorities sought and secured debt service payment deferrals from their Chinese creditors in 2020 and 2021; according to the World Bank, ‘[d]ebt service deferrals granted by major lenders in 2020-2021 amounted around 3.6 percent of GDP in 2021’ and ’[a]s a result, actual debt service payments are estimated to have declined to 48 percent of total revenues in 2021, compared to 65 percent in the 2021 [Government of Laos] plan.’  The country’s central bank (Bank of the Lao P.D.R) also made a $300 million drawdown under its currency swap agreement with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in June 2020 — when its gross reserves stood at only 1.5 months of import cover and credit rating agencies warned of a high default probability. Then, in 2021, the short-term emergency loan from the PBOC was ‘rolled over’ for another year. Around the same time, a Chinese state-owned enterprise purchased a major public infrastructure asset in Laos—a large part of the country’s electricity transmission grid—from EDL as part of an apparent debt-for-equity swap. China Southern Power Grid Co. and EDL established a joint venture known as Électricité du Laos Transmission Company Limited (EDLT) in September 2020.  China Southern Power Grid Co. purchased a 90% ownership stake in EDLT in exchange for a $600 million fee (equity infusion). Then, in March 2021, EDLT signed a 25-year concession agreement, which made it responsible for management of the country’s high-voltage transmission network above 230 kilovolts. Independent observers suggested at the time that EDL would likely use the $600 million upfront payment from China Southern Power Grid Co. to service its outstanding debts to Chinese creditors, although this has not been independently confirmed. According to the World Bank’s International Debt Statistics, the Government of Laos was responsible for making average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $232 million between 2019 and 2019 and average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $60 million between 2020 and 2021 (a substantially lower figure due to payment deferrals); however, it expected to make average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth nearly $678 million over the next seven years (2022-2028).

The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 5-year maturity and an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a margin of 3.3%. It was secured by (i.e. collateralized against) the assets of Cerro de Maimón copper and gold mine operations in the Dominican Republic. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to facilitate its acquisition of Globestar Mining Corporation, a company responsible for the Cerro de Maimón copper-gold mine in the Dominican Republic. By the end of 2010, the CDB loan had achieved a 91.2% disbursement rate ($91.2 million out of $100 million). Perilya made its first principal repayment of US$4.6 million in January 2011. The loan’s outstanding amount was $86.6 million as of December 31, 2011. Perilya, Ltd.’s acquisition of Globestar Mining Corporation was completed in December 2010.   Cerro de Maimón, is an operating copper/gold mine in the Dominican Republic. Cerro de Maimón hosts approximately 6 million tonnes of open-pit copper/gold reserves, as reported in a National Instrument 43-101 compliant technical report dated August 2007 by independent consultants. The Cerro de Maimón property, and surrounding 3,391 hectare exploitation concession, was acquired from Falconbridge Dominicana (Falcondo) in April 2002. Falcondo retained a 2% NSR of which Perilya purchased 50% in 2008. The company owns 100% of the deposit, subject to the remaining 1% NSR retained by Falcondo. The Dominican Secretary of State of Environment and Natural Resources granted the Environmental License to Perilya to mine the Cerro de Maimón mineral deposit in 2004. There is potential for expanding the reserve base of the operation from satellite deposits in Perilya's 100% owned Maimón Concession surrounding the Cerro de Maimón deposit. The Maimón Concession covers approximately 85% of the Maimón massive sulphide belt. operationsOpen pit mining operations Construction of the approximately $69 million open pit mine, processing facilities and related infrastructure began in December 2006 and was completed in October 2008. The operation has separate processing facilities for the sulphide and oxide ores. Copper is recovered from the sulphide ores with co-product gold and silver. The oxide ore is treated to recover gold-silver doré. Mining is done by a contractor using a fleet of articulated trucks, rigid body trucks and hydraulic excavators. The mined ore is sent to the appropriate sulphide or oxide ore stockpiles and waste rock to one of the several waste rock disposal piles on the property. Both the sulphide and oxide plants use the same crushing and conveying system. The two-stage crushing system reduces the ore to minus ¾ inch. The sulphide ore is processed through a 1,300 tonne per day flotation circuit using large capacity circular flotation cells followed by a re-cleaner flotation column. Primary grinding is done with a 12' x 14' ball mill with 80% passing 150 microns. A second 11' x 13' regrind mill grinds the rougher flotation concentrate to 80% passing 35 microns. The overflow from the regrind cyclone passes directly to the cleaner cells before going to the flotation column. The concentrate from the flotation column is then thickened and filtered in order to reduce the final moisture content of the concentrate to about 6%. View of processing facilities at Cerro de Maimón Concentrate is trucked to the port of Río Haina on the southern coast of the Dominican Republic where it is loaded and shipped to customers overseas. The oxide ore is processed via grinding in an 8' x 15' ball mill followed by conventional agitated cyanide leaching, counter current decantation thickening and Merrill-Crowe gold and silver recovery at a rate of 700 tonnes per day. Tailings and potentially acid generating (PAG) waste rock are deposited in a co-disposal facility designed by Golder Associates.   Perilya practices concurrent reclamation at the Cerro de Maimón property. As soon as an affected area is ready for reclamation, previously reserved topsoil is replaced and the area is re-planted with native species grown in the Company's nursery. At mine closure all infrastructure will be removed and affected areas covered with topsoil and re-vegetated. At Cerro de Maimón, Perilya has been working with local government and communities since 2005 in order to meet the Company's environmental and sustainable development objectives. Activities undertaken by Perilya include: Over 80% percent of employees at Cerro de Maimón come from within Monseñor Nouel Province. Perilya is committed to Interior view of sulphide flotation plant building   employment and training of people from local communities.

92483,ENERGY,Bank of China participates in $781 million syndicated debt financing package for 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project (Linked to Project ID#62217 and #92481),"The Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant first emerged in a 1999 study of hydropower dam potential in the Nam Theun, Sekong, and Sesan River basins in Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). However, the ADB did not follow up on the project due to its marginal financial viability and its potentially serious environmental and social impacts, especially on migratory fish stocks and fishing livelihoods. Then, in June 2007, the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy (MIME) of Cambodia granted permission for Electricité du Viet Nam (EVN) to conduct a detailed feasibility study. The study was implemented by a consulting firm, Power Engineering Consulting Joint Stock Company 1 (PECC1), in collaboration and consultation with technical ministries/agencies of the Royal Government of Cambodia. Then, on November 26, 2012, The Government of Cambodia and Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and joint venture of the Royal Group of Cambodia (39%), Hydrolancang International Energy (51%), and Vietnam Electricity (EVN) (10%) — signed an implementation agreement (IA) for the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project. On the same day, Électricité du Cambodge (EDC) and Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Under these two agreements, Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. was granted a 45-year concession (40 years of operation and a construction period of 5 years) and it was specified that the electricity generated by Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. — through the Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant — would be sold to EDC at the fixed price of 6.95 US cents per kilowatt-hour. These agreements also specified that, after 40 years of operation, the ownership of the Lower Sesan II dam will be transferred to the Government of Cambodia. On December 12, 2012, the Government of Cambodia also agreed to guarantee the payment (power purchase) obligations of EDC and Cambodia’s Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy to Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd under the PPA and the IA.  The total cost of the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project, which was implemented on a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis, was $978 million and it was financed with a mix of debt and equity. In December 2013, China Development Bank (captured via Project ID#62217), ICBC (captured via Project ID#92481), and Bank of China (captured via Project ID#92483) provided a $781 million debt financing package (with a 17-year maturity and an interest rate of 6.5%) to Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. for the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project. The financing was structured in the 2 tranches: (i) an initial bridge financing with ICBC under a financial leasing structure (the first for an infrastructure project in Cambodia); and (ii) a subsequent project financing by China Development Bank and Bank of China. Sinosure provided credit insurance. The Government of Cambodia issued a sovereign guarantee in the event on non-payment by EDC.  The purpose of this project was to construct a hydroelectric power plant in the northeastern province of Stung Treng on the Se San River. Its locational coordinates are 13°32′59.5″N 106°15′49.4″E. The Lower Sesan II Dam is 80 meters tall and occupies a 36,000-hectare plot. The plant has eight turbines and each turbine has an installed capacity of 50 megawatts (400 MW total capacity). Upon completion, the plant was expected to produce 1.9 billion kilowatt-hours per year, boost electricity production in the country by 20%, and bring installed hydropower capacity to 1328MW.  PowerChina HuaDong Engineering Corporation Limited (HDEC) was the contractor responsible for project design. Sinohydro Bureau 8 Co., Ltd was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began in December 2013. The watergate was officially closed on September 25, 2017. The first turbine began producing electricity in November 2017. The dam was officially opened on December 18, 2018.   The Chinese banks that financed the project divided environmental and social risks control into specific segments, including pre-loan investigation, loan review, contract management, loan issuance and post-loan management. They also required an environmental impact assessment (EIA) after the completion of the project. CDB went even further by introducing a standard review procedure. Sinosure also required that the project developer pay special attention to social and environmental responsibilities -- in particular, by resolving controversies around the dam through public consultation. The project developer held several public consultations with the affected communities in line with the guidelines of the Chinese banks. In July 2015, as requested by the local staff members of the CDB, the project developer held a dialogue with 140 people representing communities affected by the 400MW Lower Sesan II hydropower plant, Cambodian government representatives at national and sub-national levels, and NGOs to discuss their concerns and other issues related to the project. The participants then paid a visit on July 27, 2014 to the resettlement site to inspect on the quality of the housing construction, agricultural land, and dam construction. During the visit, community representatives and media held an informal on-site dialogue and raised questions to the Ministry of Mine and Energy’s secretary of state, project development, and the Stung Treng Deputy Governor in charge of Resettlement and Compensation Committee.   Nevertheless, the project was affected by protests from thousands of villagers who were at risk of being displaced or losing their livelihoods. On February 13, 2014, villagers living in the dam reservoir lodged a petition to the Chinese embassy in Phnom Penh, relevant ministries of the Cambodian government, and the developer to discuss compensation and resettlement conditions in detail. On August 10, 2021, Human Rights Watch released a report about the various ways in which the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project allegedly harmed the lives and livelihoods of thousands of indigenous and ethnic minority people. The report claims that the construction of the Lower Sesan 2 dam displaced nearly 5,000 people without adequately providing compensation or livelihood assistance.
