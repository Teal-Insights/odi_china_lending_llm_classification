38342,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides $405.8 million preferential buyer’s credit for Multi Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project (Linked to Project ID #52873 and #55046) [BRI],"On June 9, 2014, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, visited China and the Chinese Government and the Government of Bangladesh signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on the Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project. Then, on November 14, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed an RMB 1,950,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement and a $405.8 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project. The GCL carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a grace period of 5 years, and a 0.2% commitment fee. The PBC carries the following terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a grace period of 5 years, and a 0.2% commitment fee. Project ID#55046 captures the GCL, while Project ID#38342 captures the PBC. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the GCL and the PBC to finance a commercial contract between the Government of Bangladesh’s Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges and China Communication Construction Company (CCCC), which was signed in June 2015. The GCL had disbursed RMB 936,1890,000 as of June 30, 2018, RMB 1,557,869,000 as of June 30, 2019, RMB 1,950,000,000 as of June 30, 2020, and RMB 1,950,000,000 as of June 30, 2021. No repayments on the GCL had been made as of June 30, 2019 or June 30, 2021. As of June 30, 2021, the PBC had disbursed $165.559 million and no repayments had been made.   The purpose of the project, which is also known as the Multilane Karnaphuli Tunnel Project, is to construct a 3.4-kilometer-long, 10 meter-wide tunnel under the Karnaphuli River near the Port of Chittagong. The total length of the proposed tunnel will be around 9.092 kilometers, including a 3.40-kilometer tunnel under the Karnaphuli River with an approach road of 4.89 kilometers alongside 740 meters of bridges linking the main port city, and western side of the Karnaphuli along with the eastern side of the river. Upon completion, the tunnel will connect the port of Chittagong to the industrial area of the city and thereby relieve pressure on the three existing bridges. The total area of the project is 382.03 acres. More than 360.64 acres of land were acquired for the construction of roads and installments of utility lines.  A total of 2,275 families are affected by this project, and 1,660 were given compensation. China Communication Construction Company (CCCC) is the general (EPC) contractor responsible for project implementation. On November 24, 2015, the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) approved the Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project. Construction began on February 24, 2017.  Two years later, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh officially inaugurated boring works on the tunnel on February 24, 2019. The project had achieved a 40% physical completion rate by May 2019, including the installation of over 150 meters of the first tunnel and much of the above-ground works. Then, on July 31, 2020, the project reached a key milestone with the completion of the first underwater, after a made-in-China super-diameter slurry-pressure-balance tunnel boring machine (TBM) broke through at the Karnaphuli River east bank working shaft.    The TBM, which is 94 meters long and weighs more than 2,200 tons, was developed by the Tianhe Mechanical Equipment Manufacturing Co. It was the first super-diameter slurry-pressure-balance TBM to be self-developed and exported by China. The TBM uses several self-developed technologies, such as an automatic mud water circulation system. As of October 2021, all boring-related work was completed — after the excavation of the second tube (from Anwara end of Chittagong to Patenga end) of the 3.315-km tunnel) — and the project had achieved a 73% physical completion rate. By November 2021, the project had achieved a 77.5% physical completion rate. On May 8, 2022, Harunur Rashid Chowdhury, Project Director of Karnaphuli Multilane Road Tunnel, sent a letter to the Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA). In it, he noted that Shanghai Port had remained closed since March 2022 due to Covid-19 and the Chinese Government’s zero-tolerance policy had affected project’s progress: ‘It may be noted that […] most of the goods and equipment are being manufactured/procured from Shanghai. Therefore, the closure of the Shanghai Port is causing a delay in shipments. […] The goods and equipment planned to arrive in March [2022] are still not able to reach Chittagong Port to date. Subsequent shipments will also get affected on this account.’ In the letter, Harunur Rashid Chowdhury also asked the BBA to take up the issue with the Economic Relations Division (ERD) and arrange an extension of the China Eximbank loan availability period by six months until May 6, 2023. On May 7, 2022, Li Zheng, the CCCC Project Manager of the Karnaphuli Tunnel Project Site Office, acknowledged in a letter to Harunur Rashid Chowdhury that the delay in shipments from Shanghai was the result of China’s ‘zero Covid’ measures. Then, in June 2022, BBA announced that two sub-contractors hired CCCC to complete two project components — a management software system for BBA and the service area (east) — had violated their contractual obligations. According to a letter from Harunur Rashid Chowdhury, Project Director of Karnaphuli Multilane Road Tunnel, to the BBA, ‘CCCC was instructed to undertake this work, but they employed sub-contractors to do so.  CCCC selected these sub-contractors and is responsible for any default of the sub-contractors. […] Unfortunately, CCCC has not effectively monitored or exercised control over both these sub-contractors.’ The Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project was originally expected to reach completion by the end of 2020. However, in 2018, the project’s expected completion date was pushed back to December 4, 2022.    Upon completion, the underwater tunnel is expected to reduce the time it takes to drive from Hittagong Shah Amanat International Airport to the Hittagong industrial park from four hours to 20 minutes.",1.

59363,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides $99.79 million loan for Gibe III-Addis Ababa Power Transmission Lines Project (Linked to Project ID#59365 and ID#34447),"On March 23, 2011, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed a $188,300,000 loan agreement for the Gibe III-Addis Ababa Power Transmission Lines Project and the Gibe III-Addis Ababa Substations Project. The Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified the agreement under Proclamation No. 717/2011 on June 16, 2011 and the proclamation entered into force on July 18, 2011. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 2%, a grace period of 8 years, and a maturity of 21 years. $99,790,000 was earmarked for the Gibe III-Addis Ababa Power Transmission Lines Project (as captured via Project ID#59363) and $88,510,000 was earmarked for Gibe III-Addis Ababa Substations Project (as captured via Project ID#59365).  According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $99.79 million (ETB 1,366,986,301) loan the the Gibe III-Addis Ababa Power Transmission Lines Project achieved a 117% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 6 loan disbursements (worth ETB 1,594,690,001) between 2012 and 2015: an ETB 345,236,851 disbursement on January 8, 2012, an ETB 494,548,393 disbursement on July 7, 2012, an ETB 547,277,798 disbursement on January 28, 2013, an ETB 86,931,818 disbursement on October 8, 2013, an ETB 19,685,039 disbursement on July 8, 2014 and an ETB 101,010,101  disbursement on January 8, 2015. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s AMP,  China Eximbank made 8 loan disbursements (worth ETB 1,430,840,952) between 2012 and 2016 for the Gibe III-Addis Ababa Substations Project: an ETB 306,242,215 disbursement on January 8, 2012, an ETB 314,011,517 disbursement on January 8, 2013, an ETB 426,716,141 disbursement on April 8, 2013, an ETB 136,837,684 disbursement on July 7, 2013,  an ETB 132,196,970 disbursement on October 8, 2013, an ETB 104,597,701 disbursement on January 8, 2014, an ETB 2,047,745 disbursement on July 7, 2015, and an ETB 8,190,980 disbursement on January 7, 2016.   The purpose of the Gibe III-Addis Ababa Power Transmission Lines Project was to evacuate power from the ICBC-financed 1870MW Gilgel Gibe III hydroelectric dam (captured via Project ID#34447) to the capital city of Addis Ababa. It was designed and implemented in two ‘lots’. One of the lots involved the construction of a 293 km transmission line from Wolayta Sodo (also known as Sodo) to Sebeta via Akaki. The other lot involved the construction of a 50.3 km and 51 km double circuit transmission line from the Gibe III hydroelectric dam to the Wolayta Sodo distribution station. The Gibe III-Addis Ababa Substations Project involved the construction two new 400kv electricity distribution substations in Wolayta Sodo (Welata Sodo) and Akaki, and the expansion of an existing electricity distribution substations in Sebeta.   TBEA Co. Ltd was the EPC contractor responsible for the implementation of Gibe III-Addis Ababa Power Transmission Lines Project. Shanghai Electric Group and Sinohydro were the EPC contractors responsible for the implementation of the Gibe III-Addis Ababa Substations Project.  These projects were originally scheduled for completion by April 2013. However, they were ultimately completed in December 2015 and officially inaugurated on September 14, 2016. This project reportedly brought increased power to the southern part of the country’s electricity grid and reduced local power shortages.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Gibe III-Addis Ababa Power Transmission Lines Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023.","1. This project is also known as the 400km Transmission Lines and Substations Associated with the Gibe III Hydropower Station Project. The Chinese project title is 吉布3水电站. 2. The ICBC loan for Gibe III Hydropower Project is captured via Project ID#34447.3. According to the Gibe III project website, TBEA Co. Ltd  signed a $34,007,472.41 commercial contract on July 24, 2009, of which 85% was to be financed by China Eximbank. It is likely that the proceeds of the China Eximbank loan for the Gibe III-Addis Ababa Power Transmission Lines Project were used to finance this contract. However, this issue requires further investigation.4.

It was designed and implemented in two ‘lots’. One of the lots involved the construction of a 293 km transmission line from Wolayta Sodo (also known as Sodo) to Sebeta via Akaki. The other lot involved the construction of a 50.3 km and 51 km double circuit transmission line from the Gibe III hydroelectric dam to the Wolayta Sodo distribution station. The Gibe III-Addis Ababa Substations Project involved the construction two new 400kv electricity distribution substations in Wolayta Sodo (Welata Sodo) and Akaki, and the expansion of an existing electricity distribution substations in Sebeta.   TBEA Co. Ltd was the EPC contractor responsible for the implementation of Gibe III-Addis Ababa Power Transmission Lines Project. Shanghai Electric Group and Sinohydro were the EPC contractors responsible for the implementation of the Gibe III-Addis Ababa Substations Project.  These projects were originally scheduled for completion by April 2013. However, they were ultimately completed in December 2015 and officially inaugurated on September 14, 2016. This project reportedly brought increased power to the southern part of the country’s electricity grid and reduced local power shortages.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Gibe III-Addis Ababa Power Transmission Lines Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023.

The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 90% of the cost of a $239 million commercial (EPC) contract between Huazhong Power International Economic and Trade Co., Ltd. — a subsidiary of China Electric Power Technology Equipment Co., Ltd. — and Electricite du Laos (EDL), which was signed in December 2015. EDL is considered to be the project owner.   The purpose of the project is to reconstruct the 115 kV Donekoy substation (ສະ​ຖາ​ນີ​ໄຟ​ຟ້າ​ດອນກອຍ), the 115 kV Sokpaluang substation (ສະຖານີໄຟຟ້າໂສກປ່າຫລວງ), and the transmission line works (a 40 km 230kV line and a 50 km 500kV line) between the two substations in the capital city of Vientiane.   Huazhong Power International Economic and Trade Co., Ltd. is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Project implementation commenced on April 19, 2019. The project is still under implementation; but on July 24, 2021, the first station of the Laos substation was put online. The expected completion date of the project is April 2022.  There are some indications that the CDB loan for the Vientiane Power Grid Modernization Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. Laos’ gross foreign exchange reserves were dangerously low between 2019 and 2021, hovering between 1.4 and 2.3 months of import cover, and total public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt increased from 68 percent of GDP ($12.5 billion) in 2019 to 88 percent in 2021 of GDP (or $14.5 billion). According to a report published by the World Bank in April 2022, ‘[t]he energy sector, mostly represented by Électricité du Laos (EDL), accounted for over 30 percent of total PPG debt in 2021. […] EDL’s debt service obligations [were] still unsustainable [at the time], with future debt service accounting for about two fifths of EDL’s total operating revenue.’ The Laotian authorities sought and secured debt service payment deferrals from their Chinese creditors in 2020 and 2021; according to the World Bank, ‘[d]ebt service deferrals granted by major lenders in 2020-2021 amounted around 3.6 percent of GDP in 2021’ and ’[a]s a result, actual debt service payments are estimated to have declined to 48 percent of total revenues in 2021, compared to 65 percent in the 2021 [Government of Laos] plan.’  The country’s central bank (Bank of the Lao P.D.R) also made a $300 million drawdown under its currency swap agreement with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in June 2020 — when its gross reserves stood at only 1.5 months of import cover and credit rating agencies warned of a high default probability. Then, in 2021, the short-term emergency loan from the PBOC was ‘rolled over’ for another year. Around the same time, a Chinese state-owned enterprise purchased a major public infrastructure asset in Laos—a large part of the country’s electricity transmission grid—from EDL as part of an apparent debt-for-equity swap. China Southern Power Grid Co. and EDL established a joint venture known as Électricité du Laos Transmission Company Limited (EDLT) in September 2020.  China Southern Power Grid Co. purchased a 90% ownership stake in EDLT in exchange for a $600 million fee (equity infusion). Then, in March 2021, EDLT signed a 25-year concession agreement, which made it responsible for management of the country’s high-voltage transmission network above 230 kilovolts. Independent observers suggested at the time that EDL would likely use the $600 million upfront payment from China Southern Power Grid Co. to service its outstanding debts to Chinese creditors, although this has not been independently confirmed. According to the World Bank’s International Debt Statistics, the Government of Laos was responsible for making average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $232 million between 2019 and 2019 and average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $60 million between 2020 and 2021 (a substantially lower figure due to payment deferrals); however, it expected to make average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth nearly $678 million over the next seven years (2022-2028).",1.
