This project entry captures the USD-denominated loan and project #1243 captures the RMB-denominated loan.

The loan terms captured in this project entry, however, are those of the supplier credit from CWE to Ghana.

Some media sources indicate that Ghana’s Parliament approved the supplier credit agreement in December 1999 rather than March 2000.

In the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020, it records a maturity of 11 years for this supplier credit but does not record an interest rate or grace period. AidData records the maturity (10 years), interest rate (2%), and grace period (3 years) reported at the time that Ghana’s Parliament approved the supplier credit. The 11-year maturity recorded by SAIS-CARI appears to refer to the term of the export seller’s credit that CWE secured from China Eximbank rather than the term of the supplier credit that CWE provided to the Government of Ghana.","# Sector
