The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of a $142.28 million commercial contact between Zambia's Road Development Agency and China Harbour Engineering Limited, Ltd (CHEC), which was signed in July 2016. As of July 2022, the loan from China Eximbank had achieved a 10.1% disbursement rate ($13,219,206.11 out of $129,734,105.49).    The purpose of the project is to upgrade a 122 km stretch of the D019 road between Kawambwa to Mporokoso from gravel to the bituminous standard. CHEC is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 27, 2017. However, virtually no progress was made during 2018, with a project completion rate of 2%. Consequently, the project’s intended completion date was pushed back until July 23, 2021. According the Zambian Road Development Agency's 2020 Work Plan, construction is ongoing, but a March 9, 2020 media report says the project experienced further delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   This project has also been plagued by allegations of corruption. In June 2019, Christopher Siwakwi, an investigations officer from Zambia’s Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), told the Lusaka Magistrates’ Court that foreign currency (USD) moved from a CHEC bank account to purchase two properties allegedly owned by Zambian Infrastructure and Housing Minister Ronald Chitotela. Siwakwi, however, testified that the properties — lot number 148 of farm 50A and subdivision A of lot 22183 /M  Ibex Hill — were established to be in the names of the previous owners, Mary Lubinga and Former Labour Minister Austin Liato.  Ronald Chitotela, Gregory Chibanga and Brut Holdings were charged with two counts of concealing the two properties while Diris Mukange was charged with two counts of possession of the same properties, which are suspected to be proceeds of crime. They all pled not guilty. During the trial before principal resident magistrate David Simusamba, Christopher Siwakwi said his investigations established that the contract for the sale of the properties was in the name of Diris Mukange (as a buyer for both properties), while the negotiations for the prices were done by Ronald Chitotela and his wife when he was Deputy Minister for Sports and Youth Development. Siwakwi said the price of the property in Makeni was K1.6 million while the Ibex Hill one was purchased at K1.8 million, adding that the source of income to buy the same was tracked back to CHEC. Siwakwi recounted how ACC in June 2017 received a complaint that Ronald Chitotela was in possession of property suspected to have been proceeds of crime and had received a bribe from CHEC. Siwakwi said ACC also received additional information that the money used to purchase the properties originated from CHEC. Siwakwi said the ACC team embarked on investigations to establish whether the allegations were founded. Siwakwi said he visited the Bank of China where he established that China Harbour had a U.S. dollar account with the bank which transferred $300,000 to Andrews and Partners on July 27, 2016 at its FNB bank account which was payment for legal services and attached to the bank statement was a contract for the upgrading of Kawambwa-Mporokoso road.   On July 29, 2022, the Ministry of Finance & National Planning (MOFNP) of Zambia announced that it was seeking lender approval to formally cancel the loan’s undisbursed balance ($116,514,899.38); however, it also noted that it had not yet secured formal lender approval for this action. This announcement came approximately 21 months after the Government of Zambia defaulted on its repayment obligations to Eurobond holders and approximately 6 weeks after China, France, and 14 other countries formed a creditor committee to discuss the Zambian authorities’ request for a debt treatment under ‘the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the DSSI’ endorsed by the G20 and the Paris Club.","1.

(2014) 6 TOTAL NO. (300)] with Cameroon's Ministry of Economy, Planning, and Regional Development (MINEPAT) for the Kribi-Lolabe Highway Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a commitment fee of 0.25%, a management fee of 0.25%, a grace period of 5 years, and a maturity of 20 years. The borrower agreed to deposit project-related revenues in a special account to facilitate repayment. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the total cost ($453,892,716.00) of a commercial contract between the Steering and Monitoring Committee of the Kribi Industrial and Port Complex of Cameroon and China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd., which was signed on November 28, 2012. The remaining 15% was to be covered by the Government of Cameroon's MINEPAT.   As of December 31, 2020, the loan (PBC) had achieved a 80.6% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 40.1 billion). The loan’s outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 163.5 billion as of December 31, 2020.   The purpose of this 38.5 km (+4.5km) highway construction project is to facilitate access to the Kribi deep-sea port. It involves construction of a 38.5 km 2x2-lane highway, starting from Mboro village and running to Bibolo in the Kribi II district. It also includes the construction of 4.5 km of road that connects Kribi-Lolabe highway to the Edéa-Kribi highway (or Nationale 7 Edéa-Kribi).   China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. is the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction commenced on January 1, 2015. However, it was temporarily halted on November 26, 2018 due to (a) the failure to appoint a highway operator, (b) the failure to sign an escrow account agreement, and (c) and accumulated payment arrears worth CFA 75.5 billion. As of March 2019, the project had achieved an 88% completion rate. Then, during last few months of 2019, construction was again temporarily halted before resuming in January 2020. CHEC and the Cameroon Ministry of Public Works stated that the project had achieved an 88.14% completion as of January 2020. Then, on December 30, 2020, Cameroon’s Minister of Public Works and Minister of Finance signed a public-private partnership (PPP) contract with CHEC to finance the Cameroonian Government’s 15% of the project cost, tacitly acknowledging that the Cameroonian Government could not honor its commitment to finance 15% of the commercial contract cost due to a series of crises. The timeline for completion of the project was subsequently revised to August 2021. As of November 3, 2021, the project had achieved a 98.19% completion rate. The project achieved provisional acceptance (completion) on December 31, 2021.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Kribi-Lolabe Highway Construction Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.’","1.

The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the total cost ($453,892,716.00) of a commercial contract between the Steering and Monitoring Committee of the Kribi Industrial and Port Complex of Cameroon and China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd., which was signed on November 28, 2012. The remaining 15% was to be covered by the Government of Cameroon's MINEPAT.   As of December 31, 2020, the loan (PBC) had achieved a 80.6% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 40.1 billion). The loan’s outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 163.5 billion as of December 31, 2020.   The purpose of this 38.5 km (+4.5km) highway construction project is to facilitate access to the Kribi deep-sea port. It involves construction of a 38.5 km 2x2-lane highway, starting from Mboro village and running to Bibolo in the Kribi II district. It also includes the construction of 4.5 km of road that connects Kribi-Lolabe highway to the Edéa-Kribi highway (or Nationale 7 Edéa-Kribi).   China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. is the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction commenced on January 1, 2015. However, it was temporarily halted on November 26, 2018 due to (a) the failure to appoint a highway operator, (b) the failure to sign an escrow account agreement, and (c) and accumulated payment arrears worth CFA 75.5 billion. As of March 2019, the project had achieved an 88% completion rate. Then, during last few months of 2019, construction was again temporarily halted before resuming in January 2020. CHEC and the Cameroon Ministry of Public Works stated that the project had achieved an 88.14% completion as of January 2020. Then, on December 30, 2020, Cameroon’s Minister of Public Works and Minister of Finance signed a public-private partnership (PPP) contract with CHEC to finance the Cameroonian Government’s 15% of the project cost, tacitly acknowledging that the Cameroonian Government could not honor its commitment to finance 15% of the commercial contract cost due to a series of crises. The timeline for completion of the project was subsequently revised to August 2021. As of November 3, 2021, the project had achieved a 98.19% completion rate. The project achieved provisional acceptance (completion) on December 31, 2021.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Kribi-Lolabe Highway Construction Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.’

It is a subsidiary of Zonergy, itself a subsidiary of ZTE Corporation. On December 21, 2015, China Eximbank, China Bohai Bank, and CEPL signed a term facility agreement with three tranches. China Eximbank provided two different loan tranches to CEPL: (1) an RMB 100 million loan tranche with a 2.65% interest rate and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#54283) and (2) a $40.81 million loan with an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 4.2% margin and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#53988). China Bohai Bank Co Limited provided a loan worth $56.19 million with an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 4.35% margin and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#54284). The $149,457,000 project was financed with a debt:equity ratio of 75:25. These three loans from China Eximbank and China Bohai Bank constitute the debt component. It is unclear how the equity portion was financed.   On June 27, 2015, CEPL signed EPC contracts with China First Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd. and MCC Ruba International Construction Company Pvt. Ltd. to build, own, and operate a 100 MW AC Solar powered electric generation facility in the Solar Park. The cumulative EPC contract value is RMB 984 million. The plant began commercial operations on July 31, 2016.   However, this project appears to have encountered debt repayment and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. On October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this “[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).","1. According to multiple, official sources, the Government of Pakistan has issued sovereign guarantees in support of all loans issued by Chinese state-owned banks for independent power projects (IPPs) in Pakistan (see https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cepk/chn/zbgx/t1735166.htm and http://pk.chineseembassy.org/eng/zbgx/202110/t20211010_9558510.htm and https://www.dropbox.com/s/bmx3w2b38o7guxm/Debt%20Pricing%20of%20IPPs%20%28002%29.pdf?dl=0). As such, AidData assumes that the loan captured in this record is backed by a sovereign guarantee from the Government of Pakistan. 2. On November 8, 2014, the Chinese Government and the Government of Pakistan signed a CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement. According to Article 5 of the Agreement, ‘the Pakistani Party agrees that a revolving account shall be opened with 30 days of commercial operation of the respective project, into which the money, no less than the 22 per cent of the monthly payments for the respective power project under the agreement shall be deposited to provide cover for the shortfall in power bill recoveries from the date of power generation of the said projects agreements subject to the condition that the additional direct and indirect expenses incurred in maintaining the revolving account would be compensated by the producers through a discount arrangement to be mutually agreed.’ Subsequently, the Finance Division, in consultation with the Power Division, finalized a mechanism for the Revolving Account (RA) with the approval of The Minister of Finance in a letter dated June 22, 2015. Then, in September 2017, the Power Division forwarded a draft Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) to be signed between Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guaranteed (CPPA-G) and power producer(s) to the Finance Division. CPPA-G subsequently executed the finalized draft of RAA with multiple CPEC IPPs. The Government of Pakistan also guaranteed the funding obligations of the CPPA with respect to the RAA, through Supplemental Implementation Agreements signed between the Government of Pakistan — through the Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) — and the respective IPPs. 3. This is one of ten solar power plants at Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park financed by CDB and China Eximbank (captured via Umbrella Project ID#50939). 4. AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate for the $40.81 million loan by adding 4.2% to average 6-month LIBOR in December 2015 (0.764%). AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate for the $56.19 million loan by adding 4.35% to average 6-month LIBOR in December 2015 (0.764%).","# Sector

Crest Energy Pakistan Limited (CEPL) is a special purpose vehicle designed to facilitate the construction of a 100 MW Solar PV Power Plant located at Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park at Lal Sohanra in Cholistan, District Bahawalpur in the Province of Punjab. It is a subsidiary of Zonergy, itself a subsidiary of ZTE Corporation. On December 21, 2015, China Eximbank, China Bohai Bank, and CEPL signed a term facility agreement with three tranches. China Eximbank provided two different loan tranches to CEPL: (1) an RMB 100 million loan tranche with a 2.65% interest rate and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#54283) and (2) a $40.81 million loan with an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 4.2% margin and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#53988). China Bohai Bank Co Limited provided a loan worth $56.19 million with an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 4.35% margin and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#54284). The $149,457,000 project was financed with a debt:equity ratio of 75:25. These three loans from China Eximbank and China Bohai Bank constitute the debt component. It is unclear how the equity portion was financed.   On June 27, 2015, CEPL signed EPC contracts with China First Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd. and MCC Ruba International Construction Company Pvt. Ltd. to build, own, and operate a 100 MW AC Solar powered electric generation facility in the Solar Park. The cumulative EPC contract value is RMB 984 million. The plant began commercial operations on July 31, 2016.   However, this project appears to have encountered debt repayment and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. On October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this “[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).

1. According to multiple, official sources, the Government of Pakistan has issued sovereign guarantees in support of all loans issued by Chinese state-owned banks for independent power projects (IPPs) in Pakistan (see https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cepk/chn/zbgx/t1735166.htm and http://pk.chineseembassy.org/eng/zbgx/202110/t20211010_9558510.htm and https://www.dropbox.com/s/bmx3w2b38o7guxm/Debt%20Pricing%20of%20IPPs%20%28002%29.pdf?dl=0). As such, AidData assumes that the loan captured in this record is backed by a sovereign guarantee from the Government of Pakistan. 2. On November 8, 2014, the Chinese Government and the Government of Pakistan signed a CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement. According to Article 5 of the Agreement, ‘the Pakistani Party agrees that a revolving account shall be opened with 30 days of commercial operation of the respective project, into which the money, no less than the 22 per cent of the monthly payments for the respective power project under the agreement shall be deposited to provide cover for the shortfall in power bill recoveries from the date of power generation of the said projects agreements subject to the condition that the additional direct and indirect expenses incurred in maintaining the revolving account would be compensated by the producers through a discount arrangement to be mutually agreed.’ Subsequently, the Finance Division, in consultation with the Power Division, finalized a mechanism for the Revolving Account (RA) with the approval of The Minister of Finance in a letter dated June 22, 2015. Then, in September 2017, the Power Division forwarded a draft Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) to be signed between Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guaranteed (CPPA-G) and power producer(s) to the Finance Division. CPPA-G subsequently executed the finalized draft of RAA with multiple CPEC IPPs. The Government of Pakistan also guaranteed the funding obligations of the CPPA with respect to the RAA, through Supplemental Implementation Agreements signed between the Government of Pakistan — through the Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) — and the respective IPPs. 3. This is one of ten solar power plants at Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park financed by CDB and China Eximbank (captured via Umbrella Project ID#50939). 4. AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate for the $40.81 million loan by adding 4.2% to average 6-month LIBOR in December 2015 (0.764%).

China Eximbank lends $18.22 million for industrial development projects in PNG

# Description
In 1996, China Eximbank and the Government of Papua New Guinea (PNG) signed a preferential loan framework agreement to support industrial development projects in PNG. Then, in 2002, China’s Economic and Commercial Counsellor in PNG, Fang Zhimin, disclosed that China Eximbank had issued loans worth $18.22 million to support two forestry projects — the Veneer Factory Project managed by Heybridge Pty. Ltd. and a Logging Project managed by Fusen Industries [PNG] Pty. Ltd. — under the framework agreement.   The purpose of the 29.8 million Kina (US$ 8,567,500) Veneer Factory Project was to build a factory — located in the village of Yawasoro outside of Wewak Town in East Sepik Province — with the capacity to produce 30,000 cubic meters of dried veneer each year. The project was expected create job opportunities for about 300 Papua New Guineans. A groundbreaking ceremony for the project took place on September 25, 2001. The ceremony was attended by Chinese Ambassador to Papua New Guinea Zhao Zhenyu and East Sepik Governor Arthur Somare. Governor Somare said the veneer project was part of a package that includes a sawmill project and a coconut-activated carbon factory (to be used to purify water) and logging operations to bring in the timber. He said these would create 700 new jobs in the province.

85359,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",Bank of China contributes to a $884 million USD syndicated loan for Tangguh Liquefied Natural Gas Project (Linked to Project ID#97811),"On October 29, 2007, a syndicate of banks (including Bank of China, BTMU, DNB, Intesa San Paulo, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., and Royal Bank of Scotland) signed an $884 million loan agreement with a trustee [HSBC USA (New York)] and Japan International Finance Management (Tangguh) Corporation — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) — for the Tangguh Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project. The loan carried a maturity of 13.6 years and an interest rate of LIBOR (October 2007 6M LIBOR: 5.051%) plus a 0.335% margin. China National Offshore Oil Corporation  (CNOOC) — a Chinese state-owned enterprise — issued a corporate guarantee in support of the loan. Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., served as the facility agent for the loan.   The $884 million loan, known as the ‘Fujian tranche,’ is ring-fenced from the rest of the project and the revenues to service it will be drawn from the 25-year contract to supply 2.6 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG to CNOOC, initially through the latter’s Fujian LNG-receiving terminal. Under the trustee borrowing structure, loans are repaid from an agreed portion of gross proceeds under identified offtake contracts. The buyers make payments directly to the trustee and paying agent [HSBC USA (New York)]. The trustee is also the borrower under the loan agreement with the lenders, and the debt service payments are made from the trustee accounts. Except as otherwise provided, the lenders look to this source of debt service for all loans, with no recourse to the project and no security interest in the project assets or contracts.   Prior to the issuance of this loan, several other loans were issued for the same project: a $1.2 billion loan from Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), a $350 million loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), a $1.066 billion syndicated loan from a group of commercial banks, and an August 2006 $1.3 billion USD syndicated term loan from a syndicate of five Chinese state-owned banks — Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), China Construction Bank Corporation (CCB), China Development Bank (CB), the Export-Import Bank of China, and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) — as captured via Project ID#97811.  The debt financing package involves a complex multi-tranche Indonesian trustee borrowing structure. Repayment of the loans is supported by revenues from long-term LNG sale and purchase agreements with K-Power in South Korea, POSCO in South Korea and Sempra Energy via a receiving terminal in Mexico.   The purpose of the project is to construct an integrated greenfield liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility — with two LNG process trains (Train 1 and 2) — on the south side of Bintuni Bay in Teluk Bintuni Regency within Papua Barat Province. The LNG plant is comprised of two main components: (i) the offshore gas production facilities including 14 producing wells, 2 platforms (“trains”), and subsea pipelines to feed gas to the onshore facilities; and (ii) the onshore LNG production facilities and associated facilities, which include two identical production trains (Train 1 and 2), storage tanks for LNG (2 x 170,000 m3 ) and condensate (1 x 120,000 barrel), marine berthing facilities, utilities, offices and living facilities, off-site camp, airfield and jetty. Design optimizations together with deferral of the airfield and associated access road almost halved the site footprint. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the project would have 7.6 million tons per annum (mtpa) of production capacity to the existing Tangguh LNG facility.   The Tangguh Liquefied Natural Gas Project took shape in the mid-1990s upon the discovery of substantial gas reserves in the area. Proven reserves are around 14.4 trillion cubic feet (TCF). The project was initiated in 1997 by Atlantic Richfield Company (a US oil company) and Pertamina (a state-owned oil and gas enterprise). In April 1999, BP Plc (BP) acquired Atlantic Richfield Company and took over its lead role. Its 7 gas fields, under production-sharing contracts (PSCs), are developed under a partnership between consortia of international contractors (the PSC Contractors) and BPMIGAS as the governmental counterparty. The PSC Contractors, led by BP Berau as the Operator, operate jointly in upstream development and LNG processing for export to international markets. In May 2003, BP approached multilateral and bilateral financial institutions to seek financial assistance together with a commitment to assist the project in implementing best practices following international environmental and social guidelines.    The project began construction following the resettlement in July 2004 of Tanah Merah village (the LNG plant site). Engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contracts were entered into with a consortium of Kellogg Overseas Corporation, JGC, and PT Pertafenikki (KJP; for onshore facilities) and with PT Saipem Indonesia (for offshore facilities) in March 2005, followed by immediate issuance of the notice to proceed to start the construction. As of March 2007, the project had achieved a 70% completion rate. The offshore facilities were handed over to the project owner by May 2007. The onshore facilities were ready for start-up in January 2009 (Train 1) and June (Train 2) 2009. The first LNG production (first drop) occurred in Train 1 in June 2009. The first LNG shipment was made on July 6, 2009 using the Tangguh Foja LNG carrier.  Following the project’s achievement of ready for start-up status in 2009, the start-up process continued until mid-2011 to address technical issues, perform modification works, and ensure the stable operation and higher production efficiency of the LNG plant. Over a 3-year period from first drop in June 2009 up to June 2012 the project had produced a total of 37.8 million m3 of LNG and 5.1 million barrels of condensate.

92552,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,Africa Growing Together Fund provides EUR 42.6 million loan for Transport Sector Support Programme — Phase III: Construction of the Ring Road (Linked to Project ID#36104),"On May 22, 2014, the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the People's Bank of China (PBOC) signed an agreement for the Africa Growing Together Fund (AGTF) (see Umbrella Project ID#36104). The purpose of this $2 billion loan facility was to finance large development projects in Africa between 2014 and 2024. The AGTF is sponsored by the PBOC and the administered by AfDB. Then, on June 18, 2021, AGTF signed an EUR 42.6 million million loan agreement ) with the Government of Cameroon for the Transport Sector Support Programme — Phase III: Construction of the Ring Road. On the same day, the AfDB issued a EUR 161.6 million loan to the Government of Cameroon for the same project.    The borrowing terms of the AGTF loan are as follows: a 25-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month EURIBOR plus a 1% margin, a 0.25% upfront (management) fee, and a 0.25% commitment fee.    The purpose of the project is to support part of a 365-kilometer Ring Road that forms a loop from Bamenda-Bambui-Ndop-Babessi-Kumbo-Nkambe-Misaje-Nyos-Wum-Bafut back to Bamenda. It crosses five of the seven divisions of the North West Region and includes several links to the Nigerian border, including one from Misaje. Transport Sector Support Programme — Phase III: Construction of the Ring Road involves 4 components: road works; related facilities and support for women and youths; institutional support; and program management and coordination. The road works component involves (1) construction/rehabilitation of 280 kilometers of road corresponding to the Kumbo-Nkambe-Misaje section, including the  Nkambe bypass road (96 kilometers), the Misaje-Dumbo-Nigeria border section (50 kilometers) and the Wum–Bafut-Bamenda road section (80 kilometers) and the Bambui-Ndop-Babessi junction, including the Babungo-Dawaa sliproad section (54 kilometers); (2) development of parking areas along the road; (3) measures to protect the environment; (4) sensitization of the population on HIV/AIDS and other pandemics, environmental protection, as well as road safety in the program impact area; (5) implementation of the environmental and social management plan; and (6) reinstallation action plan.   The expected major positive impacts of the project are: (i) temporary and permanent jobs, and local trade opportunities during the construction phase; (ii) opening up of the area, regional integration and facilitation of the movement of people and goods; (iii) development of economic activities in the North-West Region; (iv) increase in the number of tourists; and (v)  increase in government revenue. The expected negative impacts on the natural environment are: (a) the quality of water that will be slightly altered; (b) the dust and exhaust gas emissions that the local population will have to suffer will be very limited and temporary; and (c) the risk of soil pollution, erosion, and modification of soil structure. The program’s executing agency is Cameroon’s Ministry of Public Works (MINTP), through the CSEPR-BAD/BM set up in 1998 by the AfDB.

Africa Growing Together Fund provides EUR 42.6 million loan for Transport Sector Support Programme — Phase III: Construction of the Ring Road (Linked to Project ID#36104)

# Description
On May 22, 2014, the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the People's Bank of China (PBOC) signed an agreement for the Africa Growing Together Fund (AGTF) (see Umbrella Project ID#36104). The purpose of this $2 billion loan facility was to finance large development projects in Africa between 2014 and 2024. The AGTF is sponsored by the PBOC and the administered by AfDB. Then, on June 18, 2021, AGTF signed an EUR 42.6 million million loan agreement ) with the Government of Cameroon for the Transport Sector Support Programme — Phase III: Construction of the Ring Road. On the same day, the AfDB issued a EUR 161.6 million loan to the Government of Cameroon for the same project.    The borrowing terms of the AGTF loan are as follows: a 25-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month EURIBOR plus a 1% margin, a 0.25% upfront (management) fee, and a 0.25% commitment fee.    The purpose of the project is to support part of a 365-kilometer Ring Road that forms a loop from Bamenda-Bambui-Ndop-Babessi-Kumbo-Nkambe-Misaje-Nyos-Wum-Bafut back to Bamenda. It crosses five of the seven divisions of the North West Region and includes several links to the Nigerian border, including one from Misaje. Transport Sector Support Programme — Phase III: Construction of the Ring Road involves 4 components: road works; related facilities and support for women and youths; institutional support; and program management and coordination. The road works component involves (1) construction/rehabilitation of 280 kilometers of road corresponding to the Kumbo-Nkambe-Misaje section, including the  Nkambe bypass road (96 kilometers), the Misaje-Dumbo-Nigeria border section (50 kilometers) and the Wum–Bafut-Bamenda road section (80 kilometers) and the Bambui-Ndop-Babessi junction, including the Babungo-Dawaa sliproad section (54 kilometers); (2) development of parking areas along the road; (3) measures to protect the environment; (4) sensitization of the population on HIV/AIDS and other pandemics, environmental protection, as well as road safety in the program impact area; (5) implementation of the environmental and social management plan; and (6) reinstallation action plan.   The expected major positive impacts of the project are: (i) temporary and permanent jobs, and local trade opportunities during the construction phase; (ii) opening up of the area, regional integration and facilitation of the movement of people and goods; (iii) development of economic activities in the North-West Region; (iv) increase in the number of tourists; and (v)  increase in government revenue. The expected negative impacts on the natural environment are: (a) the quality of water that will be slightly altered; (b) the dust and exhaust gas emissions that the local population will have to suffer will be very limited and temporary; and (c) the risk of soil pollution, erosion, and modification of soil structure. The program’s executing agency is Cameroon’s Ministry of Public Works (MINTP), through the CSEPR-BAD/BM set up in 1998 by the AfDB. The CSEPR BAD/BM’s powers were gradually extended in 2008  to cover World  Bank-financed projects and, since 2015, to projects funded by other Technical and Financial Partners (TFPs).

China Railway Engineering Corporation (CRECG) was the contractor responsible for implementation. It was awarded a $5 million contract (ID#ACGT/DG/003/2017) on July 1, 2017. The project commenced on April 7, 2017 and its originally expected completion date was 45 days late (May 22, 2017). The paving of the boulevards was completed and provisionally accepted on May 12, 2017. Additional work received provisional acceptance on January 21, 2018. The whole project was completed on January 26, 2018.
