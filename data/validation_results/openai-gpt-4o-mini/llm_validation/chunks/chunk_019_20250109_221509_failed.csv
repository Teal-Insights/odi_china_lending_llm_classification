64776,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides $321 million government concessional loan for Banha-Sekong Power Transmission Project,"On May 16, 2017, China Eximbank and the Ministry of Finance of Laos signed a $321 million government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Banha-Sekong Power Transmission Project. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance a $321 million commercial (EPC) contract between Électricité du Laos (EDL) — the state corporation of Laos that owns and operates the country's electricity generation, electricity transmission and electricity distribution assets — and China Gezhouba Group Company Limited (CGGC), which was signed on October 13, 2016.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 237-kilometer 500kV high-voltage transmission lines (measuring 237 km in length) and two 230kv substations in Champasak, Attapeu, Saravan, and Sekong provinces. Ultimately, the project sought to connect the power grids in the southern and central regions of Laos, improve the supply and stability of power to the southern region, and increase the export of electricity to earn foreign exchange.   China Energy Construction Guangxi Institute was the contractor responsible for project design. CGGC was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Project implementation commenced on January 12, 2018. On October 7, 2019, the 230 kV Banha Substation which is part of the project, was put into operation. Then, on November 1, 2020, a 18.573 km 500Kv double-circuit transmission line from Banha substation to the Cambodian border was completed.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Banha-Sekong Power Transmission Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. Laos’ gross foreign exchange reserves were dangerously low between 2019 and 2021, hovering between 1.4 and 2.3 months of import cover, and total public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt increased from 68 percent of GDP ($12.5 billion) in 2019 to 88 percent in 2021 of GDP (or $14.5 billion). According to a report published by the World Bank in April 2022, ‘[t]he energy sector, mostly represented by Électricité du Laos (EDL), accounted for over 30 percent of total PPG debt in 2021. […] EDL’s debt service obligations [were] still unsustainable [at the time], with future debt service accounting for about two fifths of EDL’s total operating revenue.’ The Laotian authorities sought and secured debt service payment deferrals from their Chinese creditors in 2020 and 2021; according to the World Bank, ‘[d]ebt service deferrals granted by major lenders in 2020-2021 amounted around 3.6 percent of GDP in 2021’ and ’[a]s a result, actual debt service payments are estimated to have declined to 48 percent of total revenues in 2021, compared to 65 percent in the 2021 [Government of Laos] plan.’  The country’s central bank (Bank of the Lao P.D.R) also made a $300 million drawdown under its currency swap agreement with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in June 2020 — when its gross reserves stood at only 1.5 months of import cover and credit rating agencies warned of a high default probability. Then, in 2021, the short-term emergency loan from the PBOC was ‘rolled over’ for another year. Around the same time, a Chinese state-owned enterprise purchased a major public infrastructure asset in Laos—a large part of the country’s electricity transmission grid—from EDL as part of an apparent debt-for-equity swap. China Southern Power Grid Co. and EDL established a joint venture known as Électricité du Laos Transmission Company Limited (EDLT) in September 2020.  China Southern Power Grid Co. purchased a 90% ownership stake in EDLT in exchange for a $600 million fee (equity infusion). Then, in March 2021, EDLT signed a 25-year concession agreement, which made it responsible for management of the country’s high-voltage transmission network above 230 kilovolts. Independent observers suggested at the time that EDL would likely use the $600 million upfront payment from China Southern Power Grid Co. to service its outstanding debts to Chinese creditors, although this has not been independently confirmed. According to the World Bank’s International Debt Statistics, the Government of Laos was responsible for making average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $232 million between 2019 and 2019 and average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $60 million between 2020 and 2021 (a substantially lower figure due to payment deferrals); however, it expected to make average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth nearly $678 million over the next seven years (2022-2028).","1.

54066,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",China Eximbank provides $884 million loan for the Aromatic Hydrocarbons Complex Construction Project at the Atyrau Refinery via the restricted portion of a master loan facility with Development Bank of Kazakhstan JSC (Linked to Project ID#54797),"On August 1, 2009, the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank) entered into a master facility agreement with the Development Bank of Kazakhstan JSC (DBK). China Eximbank permitted DBK to draw down up to $5 billion from a master facility agreement (MFA), which included an unrestricted $1.5 billion tranche and a restricted $3.5 billion tranche. The agreement was for a period of up to 15 years and it prohibited DBK from incurring indebtedness exceeding 25% of its assets or disposing of over 25% of its assets, in addition to a change of control clause favoring China Eximbank. The restricted portion of the MFA was for projects with a Chinese component, whereas the unrestricted portion was for DBK’s general purposes.   The restricted portion of the China Eximbank MFA was aimed at the development of energy, transport and communication infrastructure and the funding of strategic projects in the metallurgy, chemical, and oil industries. The proceeds from this credit facility were also be used for investment projects of Kazakhstani companies, including the exporting of industrial output, services and equipment to China. Under the restricted portion of the China Eximbank MFA (as captured via Project ID#54797), DBK entered into a $884 million individual credit agreement with China Eximbank on December 12, 2009. The maturity date of this individual credit agreement was July 21, 2023. Principal and interest under the agreement was to be paid semi-annually. The loan was prepaid in full in July 2019.  DBK then used these loan proceeds to on-lend to Atyrau Refinery LLP (a project company and special purpose vehicle responsible for the financing, design, and construction of the Aromatic Hydrocarbons Complex Construction Project at the Atyrau Refinery) as part of a larger $1.63 billion loan agreement. This loan agreement with Atyrau Refinery LLP, which is a subsidiary of KazMunayGas (a state-owned oil and gas company in Kazakhstan), was divided into a $691.4 million tranche with an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 4.5% margin, a $40.4 million tranche with an interest rate of 7.72% per annum (payable in KZT), and a ₸58.536 million KZT tranche with an interest rate of 10.99% per annum (payable in KZT).   Atyrau Refinery LLP was expected to use the loan proceeds to finance a $1.04 billion commercial contract that it signed with Sinopec Engineering on October 29, 2009. DBK also offered a ₸26.401 million KZT credit line for the project, while Atyrau Refinery LLP contributed $66.63 million.   The purpose of the Aromatic Hydrocarbons Complex Construction Project was to construct an aromatic hydrocarbons complex at the Atyrau Refinery capable of producing benzol and paraxylene. It also sought to increase the plant's balanced capacity to 5 million tons per year and produce motor fuels that meet K3 environmental requirements.   Sinopec Tenth Construction Co Ltd was the contractor responsible for project implementation.
