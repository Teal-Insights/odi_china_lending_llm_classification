Then, on September 6, 2018, Liu-Yan, President of China National Complete Plant Import Export Corporation (COMPLANT) and Ally Coulibaly, Cote d’Ivoire’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, signed a protocol to mobilize CFA 262 billion (EUR 399.4 million or USD 473.4 million) for the Ferkessédougou Dry Port Construction Project. On January 30, 2020, ICBC and the Government of Cote d’Ivoire signed a loan agreement worth CFA 254,171,513,219.12 Ferkessédougou Dry Port Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the loan is backed by a Sinosure credit insurance policy. The borrower is expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance a CFA 254,171,513,995 commercial (EPC) contract (for Lot 1) between the Government of Cote d’Ivoire and China National Complete Plant Import Export Corporation (COMPLANT), which was signed on May 22, 2019.   According to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the ICBC had not disbursed as of December 31, 2022.  The project is divided into two ‘lots’. Lot 1 involves site remediation and development activities as well as the construction of a (multimodal) logistics platform — with warehouses, cold chain equipment, etc. — and hydrocarbon depot. Lot 2 involves the construction of a slaughterhouse, a cattle market, and an industrial zone for the development and processing of agricultural and mining products. The project site is spread over an area of ​​3185 hectares and located in the village of Dékovogo, approximately 5 km from the capital of Tchologo and near the northern city of Ferkessédougou. Upon completion, the dry port of Ferkessédougou is expected to relieve congestion and bring the autonomous port of Abidjan closer to its regional partners such as Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. It is also expected to make a lasting contribution to the development of the northern regions of the country and to the enhancement of the economic potential of the Poro, Tchologo, and Bagoué regions in Savanes District, and Bounkani, and Gontougo regions in Zanzan district. The project is also expected to generate more than 71,000 direct jobs that will directly benefit young men and women.  Lot 2 is being financed and implemented on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis. Lot 1, which is spread over an area of 732 hectares, is not. COMPLANT is the contractor responsible for the implementation of Lot 1.  A foundation-laying ceremony took place on May 21, 2021. However, according to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), this project faced implementation delays due to resource mobilization problems related to the host government’s counterpart financing contribution and the credit insurance policy with Sinosure. Then, in June 2022, the Government of Cote d’Ivoire partially met its counterpart financing commitment (by providing 68.4% of the required amount: CFA 26 billion out of CFA 38 billion).  Lot 1 was originally expected to take 30 months to complete (November 21, 2023). The project as a whole (Lots 1 and 2) was originally expected to reach completion on December 31, 2025.","1.

ICBC provides CFA 254.1 billion loan for Ferkessédougou Dry Port Construction Project

# Description
On August 31, 2018, Cote d’Ivoire’s President Alassane Ouattara and Chinese President Xi Jinping signed an MOU regarding the Ferkessédougou Dry Port Construction Project. Then, on September 6, 2018, Liu-Yan, President of China National Complete Plant Import Export Corporation (COMPLANT) and Ally Coulibaly, Cote d’Ivoire’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, signed a protocol to mobilize CFA 262 billion (EUR 399.4 million or USD 473.4 million) for the Ferkessédougou Dry Port Construction Project. On January 30, 2020, ICBC and the Government of Cote d’Ivoire signed a loan agreement worth CFA 254,171,513,219.12 Ferkessédougou Dry Port Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the loan is backed by a Sinosure credit insurance policy. The borrower is expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance a CFA 254,171,513,995 commercial (EPC) contract (for Lot 1) between the Government of Cote d’Ivoire and China National Complete Plant Import Export Corporation (COMPLANT), which was signed on May 22, 2019.   According to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the ICBC had not disbursed as of December 31, 2022.  The project is divided into two ‘lots’. Lot 1 involves site remediation and development activities as well as the construction of a (multimodal) logistics platform — with warehouses, cold chain equipment, etc. — and hydrocarbon depot. Lot 2 involves the construction of a slaughterhouse, a cattle market, and an industrial zone for the development and processing of agricultural and mining products. The project site is spread over an area of ​​3185 hectares and located in the village of Dékovogo, approximately 5 km from the capital of Tchologo and near the northern city of Ferkessédougou. Upon completion, the dry port of Ferkessédougou is expected to relieve congestion and bring the autonomous port of Abidjan closer to its regional partners such as Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. It is also expected to make a lasting contribution to the development of the northern regions of the country and to the enhancement of the economic potential of the Poro, Tchologo, and Bagoué regions in Savanes District, and Bounkani, and Gontougo regions in Zanzan district. The project is also expected to generate more than 71,000 direct jobs that will directly benefit young men and women.  Lot 2 is being financed and implemented on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis. Lot 1, which is spread over an area of 732 hectares, is not. COMPLANT is the contractor responsible for the implementation of Lot 1.  A foundation-laying ceremony took place on May 21, 2021. However, according to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), this project faced implementation delays due to resource mobilization problems related to the host government’s counterpart financing contribution and the credit insurance policy with Sinosure. Then, in June 2022, the Government of Cote d’Ivoire partially met its counterpart financing commitment (by providing 68.4% of the required amount: CFA 26 billion out of CFA 38 billion).  Lot 1 was originally expected to take 30 months to complete (November 21, 2023). The project as a whole (Lots 1 and 2) was originally expected to reach completion on December 31, 2025.

60747,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides RMB 810 million government concessional loan for Port Gentil-Omboué Road and Bridge Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#73174),"On September 9, 2013, the Government of Gabon and China Eximbank signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 810 million (or approximately $121 million) for the Port Gentil-Omboue Road and Booué Bridge Construction Project. This loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. In 2013, the Government of Gabon and China Eximbank also signed a USD-denominated preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the Port Gentil-Omboué Road and Ogooué River Booué Bridge Construction Project.  The face value of the PBC was approximately 254.4 billion CFA francs, or approximately $534,582,600. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. The proceeds from the GCL and the PBC were used to finance a $663 million EPC contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC). Approximately 95% of the cost of this project was financed by China Eximbank while the remaining 5% was financed by the Government of Gabon itself.  The GCL that supported this project is captured in Project ID#60747. The PBC that supported this project is captured in Project ID#73174.   The project involved the construction of a 93.26 km two-way, two-lane highway from Port Gentil to Omboué (with an asphalt concrete surface, a subgrade width of 12 meters, and a subgrade width of 10 meters), the construction of three bridges (the 4707 meter Ogooué River Bridge, the 367 meter Booué Bridge, and the 4577 meter Nkomi Laguna Bridge) measuring 13 km in length, and the construction of 141 culverts.   CRBC was the contractor responsible for project implementation. It received an order to commence construction on March 20, 2014. Then, a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 3, 2014. The project was handed over on December 23, 2020.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loans for the Port Gentil-Omboue Road and Bridge Construction Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In mid-2014, a decline in international oil prices generated sharp reductions in Gabon’s oil exports and fiscal revenues. The country’s rising fiscal deficit led to the accumulation of arrears to external creditors. By 2017, the stock of the Government of Gabon’s external arrears stood at $115 million, including arrears to China, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Israel, and South Korea. All of these arrears were successfully cleared by 2020. However, the Government of Gabon accumulated $3 million of additional arrears to Chinese creditors in 2020.  By the end of May 2021, ‘the stock of [the Government of] Gabon’s external arrears stood at CFAF 98.03 billion (US$182.1 million), including CFAF 23.8 billion (US$44.2 million) vis-à-vis multilaterals and CFAF 21.05 billion (US$39.1 million) vis-à-vis government agencies and private creditors insured with companies from Paris Club member countries and from China [ICBC and China Construction Bank] CFAF 1.3 billion (US$2.42 million). The Government's strategy for the clearance of existing external arrears consists of focusing primarily on multilateral debt, bilateral debt, insured commercial commitments and seeking agreements with other creditors prior to the IMF Board meeting. Accordingly, we will clear the arrears vis-à-vis the multilaterals. We will also clear bilateral and commercial-insured arrears as follows: (i) Austria CFAF 6.83 billion (US$12.69 million); (ii) France CFAF 11.9 billion (US$22.11 million); (iii) Israel CFAF 2.23 billion (US$4.13 million); and Spain CFAF 0.09 billion (US$0.17 million). Regarding the other commercial arrears vis-à-cis AFREXIMBANK (CFAF 7.52 billion or US$13.97 million, and commercial non-insured vis-à-vis France CFAF 0.7 billion (US$1.24 million), Austria CFAF 8.71 billion (US$16.18 million), and Morocco CFAF 1.01 billion (US$1.87 million), we contacted these creditors individually to obtain from them the non-objection agreement. The same communication was made with China to which our bilateral payment arrears are about CFAF 34.01 billion (US$63.17 million).’ Then, in 2022, the IMF reported that the Government of Gabon’s external arrears to Chinese creditors stood at $23.9 million as of December 2021 and $1 million in June 2022.","1. This project is also known as the Port Gentil-Omboué Road and Ogooué River Booué Bridge Construction Project, the PO Project, and the Libreville-Port-Gentil Road Project. The French project title is Port-Gentil-Omboué et du Pont sur l’Ogooué à Booué or the Route POG Omboué. The Chinese project title is 加蓬 让蒂尔港-翁布韦段公路 or 让蒂尔港-翁布埃沿海路及博韦大桥项目.2.  In the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020, it only identifies a single (concessional) loan for this project worth $134 million. However, the Government of Gabon, the Chinese Government and CRBC all report that China Eximbank covered approximately 95% of this $663 million project with a government concessional loan and a preferential buyer’s credit. Therefore, AidData records both of these loans.   3. Some sources indicate that this project also supported the construction of a 243 km road from Omboué to Yombi. However, these appear to be references to a second phase of the project.  The extension from Omboué to Yombi will eventually allow this road to link up with the Nationale No. 1, Gabon’s main road from Libreville to the south of the country (Lambaréné, Ndendé) and Congo-Brazzaville.","# Sector

Approximately 95% of the cost of this project was financed by China Eximbank while the remaining 5% was financed by the Government of Gabon itself.  The GCL that supported this project is captured in Project ID#60747. The PBC that supported this project is captured in Project ID#73174.   The project involved the construction of a 93.26 km two-way, two-lane highway from Port Gentil to Omboué (with an asphalt concrete surface, a subgrade width of 12 meters, and a subgrade width of 10 meters), the construction of three bridges (the 4707 meter Ogooué River Bridge, the 367 meter Booué Bridge, and the 4577 meter Nkomi Laguna Bridge) measuring 13 km in length, and the construction of 141 culverts.   CRBC was the contractor responsible for project implementation. It received an order to commence construction on March 20, 2014. Then, a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 3, 2014. The project was handed over on December 23, 2020.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loans for the Port Gentil-Omboue Road and Bridge Construction Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In mid-2014, a decline in international oil prices generated sharp reductions in Gabon’s oil exports and fiscal revenues. The country’s rising fiscal deficit led to the accumulation of arrears to external creditors. By 2017, the stock of the Government of Gabon’s external arrears stood at $115 million, including arrears to China, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Israel, and South Korea. All of these arrears were successfully cleared by 2020. However, the Government of Gabon accumulated $3 million of additional arrears to Chinese creditors in 2020.  By the end of May 2021, ‘the stock of [the Government of] Gabon’s external arrears stood at CFAF 98.03 billion (US$182.1 million), including CFAF 23.8 billion (US$44.2 million) vis-à-vis multilaterals and CFAF 21.05 billion (US$39.1 million) vis-à-vis government agencies and private creditors insured with companies from Paris Club member countries and from China [ICBC and China Construction Bank] CFAF 1.3 billion (US$2.42 million). The Government's strategy for the clearance of existing external arrears consists of focusing primarily on multilateral debt, bilateral debt, insured commercial commitments and seeking agreements with other creditors prior to the IMF Board meeting. Accordingly, we will clear the arrears vis-à-vis the multilaterals. We will also clear bilateral and commercial-insured arrears as follows: (i) Austria CFAF 6.83 billion (US$12.69 million); (ii) France CFAF 11.9 billion (US$22.11 million); (iii) Israel CFAF 2.23 billion (US$4.13 million); and Spain CFAF 0.09 billion (US$0.17 million). Regarding the other commercial arrears vis-à-cis AFREXIMBANK (CFAF 7.52 billion or US$13.97 million, and commercial non-insured vis-à-vis France CFAF 0.7 billion (US$1.24 million), Austria CFAF 8.71 billion (US$16.18 million), and Morocco CFAF 1.01 billion (US$1.87 million), we contacted these creditors individually to obtain from them the non-objection agreement. The same communication was made with China to which our bilateral payment arrears are about CFAF 34.01 billion (US$63.17 million).’ Then, in 2022, the IMF reported that the Government of Gabon’s external arrears to Chinese creditors stood at $23.9 million as of December 2021 and $1 million in June 2022.

(2012) 10TOTAL NO.(198) 1420303052012210261] for Phase 1 of the Yaounde-Douala Highway Project.  The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.30% commitment fee, and a 0.30% management fee. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan (PBC) to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $568,000,000 commercial (EPC) contract between Cameroon’s Ministry of Public Works of the Republic of Cameroon and China First Highway Engineering Co. Ltd. (CFHEC), which was signed on August 8, 2011.   As of December 31, 2020, the loan had achieved a 73.2% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 69.4 billion). The loan’s amount outstanding was equivalent to CFA 188.1 billion as of December 31, 2020.   The purpose of the Yaounde-Douala highway project is to facilitate the construction of a 215 km road linking Douala on the western coast with capital Yaounde. Phase 1 will involve construction of a 68.3 km long road, which will run from Yaoundé to Bot Makak/Bibodi. The six-lane highway will be the first new motorway since the country's independence. The project seeks to replace the existing hazardous two-lane highway, and it aims to boost domestic and sub-regional trade as well as shorten the distance between Douala and Yaounde from 265 km to 215 km.   CFHEC was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Phase 1 construction activities began on April 15, 2014, and the originally expected project completion date was October 13, 2018; however, by April 29, 2014, there was reportedly a protracted conflict between China First Highway Engineering Co. Ltd. (CFHEC) and the Control Mission led by the SCET-Tunisie/Louis Berger. Project implementation was delayed by unpaid indemnity owed to those living along the first 10 km of highway. The Cameroonian authorities also reportedly made modifications to the specifications of the project by increasing the speed limit from 100 km/hour to 110 km/hour and adding extra lanes, leading the EPC contractor to assert that according to the budget only 47 km of the road could be constructed under such conditions. By January 2015, construction had recommenced, as reported by the China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) who noted that tree felling had taken place along 40 km of the road’s route and that earthworks had started not long before. Then, in 2017, delays in payment to the contractor led to a one month suspension of construction beginning on May 2, 2017 and concluding in June 2017 after settlements were paid.  As of May 2019, Phase 1 had achieved a 74% completion rate. As of February 2020, the project had achieved a 80% completion rate and 6 of 36 engineering structures were not yet finished. In April 2020, the company in charge of supervising the works, SCET-TUNISIE, reported that the project was scheduled to reach completion by December 2020 in spite of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of August 2021, the project had achieved a 98% completion rate.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the Yaounde-Douala Highway Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed).

'Many companies that want to invest in the country have backed off due to this restraint,' Samuel told Fortune. The new decision was passed after having a serious debate with the officials of the National Bank of Ethiopia,” Samuel said. The companies were also frustrated by the directive, which limited them from obtaining loans from international creditors. “Since international creditors require the forex account of borrowers as a requirement for loan approval, the companies, especially Poly-GCL, have been continuously calling for the reversal of the directive,' said Samuel. Poly GCL, which discovered crude oil reserves in three wells in the Hilala region and launched test production in June 2018, has been filing complaint letters with the government for the past two years. The companies have been transferring foreign currency into their local accounts to finance their oil and gas exploration activities and withdrawing cash in local currency for their expenditures.","# Sector

The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. Then, in 2017, ICBC and the Government of Zambia signed a $59.58 million loan agreement for the Ndola International Airport Construction Project (captured via Project ID#57092). The borrowing terms of the ICBC loan are unknown. The proceeds of the China Eximbank PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $397,201,694 commercial (EPC) contract between Zambia Airports Corporation Limited (ZACL) and AVIC International Holding Corporation, which was signed on September 11, 2013 and amended on August 25, 2014. The proceeds of the ICBC loan were to be used by the borrower to finance 15% of the cost of the $397,201,694 commercial (EPC) contract between Zambia Airports Corporation Limited (ZACL) and AVIC International Holding Corporation. As of July 2022, the China Eximbank loan had achieved a 57.1% disbursement rate ($192,785,140.88 out of $337,621,439.90).   The project involved the construction of a 12,000 square meter terminal building, 3 aero bridges, a 3.5 kilometer runway, a cargo terminal, a 50-room hotel, a new fire and rescue station, a cargo terminal, an aircraft maintenance hangar, and a fuel farm. AVIC International Holding Corporation was the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. It reportedly fulfilled the government policy of having 20 percent sub-contracting to local contractors by engaging 60 local sub-contractors. 2,700 people were employed during the project construction period.   A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on June 25, 2017. However, the construction site was not handed over to the EPC contractor until September 28, 2017. The EPC contract went into effect and construction began on October 26, 2017. By December 17, 2019, the overall project had achieved a 58% completion rate; the passenger terminal completion rate was 61%, the business complex completion rate was 49%, the air traffic control building completion rate was 54%, the runway, taxiway and apron completion rate was 98%, and the viaduct completion rate was 80%. As of March 2020, the project had achieved an overall completion rate of 60%. As of April 2021, the project had achieved an overall completion rate of 88.9%. The project was originally expected to reach completion on October 20, 2020. However, due to implementation delays related to financing problems and the COVID-19 pandemic, the intended project completion date was pushed out to January 31, 2022. The airport was officially commissioned on August 5, 2021, but the airport was still reportedly waiting for operational certifications at that time. This project has also been plagued by financial problems due to overdue contractor payments. According to Clause 43.1 of the commercial contract between AVIC International Holding Corporation and ZACL, if the client (ZACL) failed to make payment within a stipulated period of time, the EPC contractor (AVIC International Holding Corporation) was entitled to the payment of interest for the late payment, which was to be calculated from the date by which the payment should have been made until the date on which payment was made by applying the interest rate as per local practice. If the payment was delayed for more than 56 days, the EPC contractor would have the right to suspend the works or terminate the commercial contract. Contrary to the clause, AVIC International Holding Corporation had not been paid a total of $97,324,668 being outstanding interim payment certificates (IPCs) for a period of more than fourteen months. In addition, there was no documentation availed to the Auditor General of Zambia to indicate why, despite the financing agreement being in force, the lender had not paid the contractor.   On April 5, 2021, AVIC International Holding Corporation claimed interest on late payments on outstanding IPCs in amounts totaling $1,913,155. AVIC International Senior Consultant, Lei Yingqi, later confirmed that AVIC International Holding Corporation as an EPC contractor was using borrowed funds at high interest rates to ensure that the project continued to progress and the employees continued to be paid. He also indicated that ‘support from abroad was cut off or delayed’, which suggests that the source of the borrowed funds was not China Eximbank or ICBC.

Then, on December 14, 2016, a bidding consortium (joint venture) consisting of China Gezhouba Group Company Limited and China Gezhouba Group International Engineering Co. Ltd was identified as providing the most advantageous bid for the Azad Pattan Hydropower Plant Construction Project. An award was made to this bidding consortium on December 27, 2016. Approximately six months later, on June 11, 2017, the Government of Pakistan, China Gezhouba Group Company Limited, and China Gezhouba Group International Engineering Co. Ltd signed a commercial (EPC) contract for the Azad Pattan Hydropower Plant Construction Project. The EPC contract was structured as an onshore civil works contract and an offshore supply contract covering imported M&E plant and equipment for permanent installation in the power generating complex. It included provisions for adjusting the contract price for changes in costs for cement, fuel, steel reinforcement and labour due to variation in applicable prices/indices published by Pakistan Bureau of Statistics from the specified base date (November 2016) through construction to commercial operations date (COD).  On June 23, 2017, Azad Pattan Power (Private) Limited — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of China Gezhouba Group Company Limited (80% ownership stake) and Laraib Group (20%) ownership stake — submitted a tariff proposal to the Government of Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) for the Azad Pattan Hydropower Plant Construction Project. At that time, the estimated cost of the project was $1,516,170,000 and it was expected to be financed according to a 75:25 debt:equity ratio. China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd. (CGGC) agreed to partially finance the equity portion equal to $379.04 million (as captured via Project ID#54233). At the time that the tariff proposal was submitted to NEPRA, Azad Pattan Power (Private) Limited expected that a consortium of Chinese state-owned banks — consisting of China Development Bank (CDB), China Construction Bank (CCB), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and Bank of China (BOC) — would provide a $1,137,130,000 syndicated overseas investment loan in support of the project. The proposed borrowing terms included an 18-year maturity, a 6-year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.3% to 4.2%, a 0.8% commitment fee, and a 1% management fee. Repayments would be made in 24 equal semi-annual installments (over 12 years). Sinosure was also expected to provide overseas investment loan insurance for this project. Then, on November 10, 2017, a grid interconnection study for the project was approved by NTDC. A Panel of Experts (POE) constituted by PPIB approved an optimized design of the project with installed capacity of 700.7 MW on December 6, 2017. The project secured approvals from the relevant Environmental Protection Agencies (EPAs) in March 2018. The EPC stage tariff was determined by NEPRA on May 17, 2018 and amended through a review determination on October 11, 2018. On July 6, 2020, China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd. (CGGC) and the Government of Pakistan signed 30-year concession (‘project implementation’) agreement and agreed to implement the project on a Build, Own, Operate, Transfer (BOOT) basis. At the end of a 30-year concession period, the project owner (Azad Pattan Power Private Limited) will handed over the power plant to the Government of Pakistan. Azad Pattan Power Private Limited also signed a Water Use Agreement with the Government of Punjab and a Tripartite Power Purchase Agreement on July 6, 2020. Then, on December 1, 2020, Azad Pattan Power (Private) Limited and Government of Azad Jammu & Kashmir signed the GoAJ&K Implementation Agreement (GoAJ&K IA) and GoAJ&K Water Use Agreement (GoAJ&K WUA). A Term Sheet defining key terms and conditions agreed between Azad Pattan Power (Private) Limited (borrower) and the consortium of Chinese state-owned banks was executed on January 5, 2021.  Roughly one year later, on December 31, 2021, Azad Pattan Power (Private) Limited signed a $1.540 billion syndicated loan agreement (‘finance facility agreement’) with China Development Bank (Project ID#54234), China Construction Bank (Project ID#92636), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Project ID#92635), and Bank of China (Project ID#92637). At that time, the project was expected to achieve a ‘financial close’ and start construction on December 31, 2022. Construction was expected to last 69 months (October 1, 2028). In January 2022, reports emerged that Sinosure was reluctant to issue a credit insurance policy to the borrower (due to rising circular debt and the generally negative outlook for Pakistan’s power sector), which threatened to delay the achievement of financial close.  The purpose of the project is to construct a 700.7 MW hydroelectric power plant that is located about 90 km from Islamabad located on River Jhelum comprising (from upstream to downstream) Chakoti Hattian, Kohala, Mahl, Azad Pattan and Karot. Once commissioned, the power plant is expected to generate about 3.3 billion units of clean energy every year.","1. The Chinese project title is 巴基斯坦阿扎德帕坦水电站项目 or 帕坦投资项目 or 阿扎德帕坦水电站BOOT项目.2.

As such, AidData assumes that the loan captured in this record is backed by a sovereign guarantee from the Government of Pakistan.4. In December 2019, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Energy Joint Working Group decided to include the 700.7 MW Azad Pattan Hydropower Plant Construction Project in their list of energy projects. 5. AidData has estimated the borrowing terms of the loan based upon the indicative terms that were recorded in the June 23, 2017 tariff proposal to NEPRA. The 6-year grace period was estimated by taking the difference between the expected maturity (18 years) and the expected duration of the repayment period (12 years). The all-in interest rate was estimated by adding 2.75% (the midpoint between 1.3% and 4.2%) to the average 6-month LIBOR rate in December 2021 (0.306%). 6. Several sources refer to a security agreement. Therefore, AidData assumes that this loan is collateralized for the time being. This issue warrants further investigation.5. The size of the contributions from CDB, ICBC, PBC, and CCB are unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes that CDB, ICBC, PBC, and CCB each contributed $385 million (i.e. equally sized contributions to the lending syndicate).","# Sector

At that time, the estimated cost of the project was $1,516,170,000 and it was expected to be financed according to a 75:25 debt:equity ratio. China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd. (CGGC) agreed to partially finance the equity portion equal to $379.04 million (as captured via Project ID#54233). At the time that the tariff proposal was submitted to NEPRA, Azad Pattan Power (Private) Limited expected that a consortium of Chinese state-owned banks — consisting of China Development Bank (CDB), China Construction Bank (CCB), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and Bank of China (BOC) — would provide a $1,137,130,000 syndicated overseas investment loan in support of the project. The proposed borrowing terms included an 18-year maturity, a 6-year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.3% to 4.2%, a 0.8% commitment fee, and a 1% management fee. Repayments would be made in 24 equal semi-annual installments (over 12 years). Sinosure was also expected to provide overseas investment loan insurance for this project. Then, on November 10, 2017, a grid interconnection study for the project was approved by NTDC. A Panel of Experts (POE) constituted by PPIB approved an optimized design of the project with installed capacity of 700.7 MW on December 6, 2017. The project secured approvals from the relevant Environmental Protection Agencies (EPAs) in March 2018. The EPC stage tariff was determined by NEPRA on May 17, 2018 and amended through a review determination on October 11, 2018. On July 6, 2020, China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd. (CGGC) and the Government of Pakistan signed 30-year concession (‘project implementation’) agreement and agreed to implement the project on a Build, Own, Operate, Transfer (BOOT) basis. At the end of a 30-year concession period, the project owner (Azad Pattan Power Private Limited) will handed over the power plant to the Government of Pakistan. Azad Pattan Power Private Limited also signed a Water Use Agreement with the Government of Punjab and a Tripartite Power Purchase Agreement on July 6, 2020. Then, on December 1, 2020, Azad Pattan Power (Private) Limited and Government of Azad Jammu & Kashmir signed the GoAJ&K Implementation Agreement (GoAJ&K IA) and GoAJ&K Water Use Agreement (GoAJ&K WUA). A Term Sheet defining key terms and conditions agreed between Azad Pattan Power (Private) Limited (borrower) and the consortium of Chinese state-owned banks was executed on January 5, 2021.  Roughly one year later, on December 31, 2021, Azad Pattan Power (Private) Limited signed a $1.540 billion syndicated loan agreement (‘finance facility agreement’) with China Development Bank (Project ID#54234), China Construction Bank (Project ID#92636), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Project ID#92635), and Bank of China (Project ID#92637). At that time, the project was expected to achieve a ‘financial close’ and start construction on December 31, 2022. Construction was expected to last 69 months (October 1, 2028). In January 2022, reports emerged that Sinosure was reluctant to issue a credit insurance policy to the borrower (due to rising circular debt and the generally negative outlook for Pakistan’s power sector), which threatened to delay the achievement of financial close.  The purpose of the project is to construct a 700.7 MW hydroelectric power plant that is located about 90 km from Islamabad located on River Jhelum comprising (from upstream to downstream) Chakoti Hattian, Kohala, Mahl, Azad Pattan and Karot. Once commissioned, the power plant is expected to generate about 3.3 billion units of clean energy every year.

67091,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",China Eximbank and CDB provide EUR 2.5 billion of debt financing for Arctic LNG 2 Project (Linked to Project ID#89463),"On November 1, 2017, China Development Bank signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Novatek regarding the Arctic LNG 2 Project.  A special purpose vehicle (SPV) and project company — called Arctic LNG 2 LLC — has been established to finance, design, implement, and operate this project. In September 2020, a group of lenders — including France’s Bpifrance, Germany’s Euler Hermes, Italy’s SACE, Russia’s Sberbank, China Development Bank (CDB), and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) — expressed interest in financing the Arctic LNG 2 project. At the time, CDB was expected to offer a $5 billion loan in support of the $21 billion project.    Then, on April 28, 2021, Arctic LNG 2 LLC — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of NOVATEK (60%), Total (10%), CNPC (10%), CNOOC (10%) and the Japan Arctic LNG, consortium of Mitsui & Co, Ltd. and JOGMEC (10%) — announced the signing of an EUR 3.11 billion loan agreement with a syndicate of Russian banks, including PJSC Sberbank, Gazprombank (Joint Stock Company) and its subsidiary Bank GPB International S.A., State Development Corporation VEB.RF and «Bank Otkritie Financial Corporation» (Public Joint-Stock Company). This loan carries a 15-year maturity and it is apparently collateralized against NOVATEK’s 60% equity stake in Arctic LNG-2 LLC. As of September 30, 2021, about 52% of the total planned capital expenditures of Arctic LNG 2 Project had been financed. Then, on November 30, 2021, Arctic LNG 2 LLC announced the signing of loan agreements with a group international financial institutions and commercial banks. The maximum aggregate borrowing amount under the loan facilities to be provided by the Russian and international banks is EUR 9.5 billion for up to 15 years. These credit facility agreements including buyer’s credit facility agreements with China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China worth EUR 2.5 billion. The borrower also purchased buyer’s credit insurance from Sinosure. Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) also issued a loan to Arctic LNG 2.   The loan proceeds are to be used by the borrower to finance an EPC contract with TechnipFMC, which was signed in July 2019.  The purpose of the project is to create a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility consisting of three trains, each using concrete gravity-based structures. The LNG facility will be located in the Gydan Peninsula in Siberia. Upon completion, its expected annual LNG production capacity is 19.8 million metric tons per year. TechnipFMC — a joint venture of Technip Energies, Saipem and NIPIGAS — is the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Wison Offshore and Marine Ltd is a subcontractor involved in the project; its scope of work is engineering, procurement, fabrication, and commissioning of modules in train one with a total weight of 48,000 MT. The project’s front-end engineering design (FEED) was completed in October 2018. A final investment decision (FID) made in September 2019.   On June 17, 2021, the first plane landed at the Utrenniy airport built specifically for the Arctic LNG 2 project on the Gydan Peninsula in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region.  Shanghai-based Wison Offshore and Marine Ltd, a subsidiary of privately owned Chinese conglomerate Wison Group, shipped the first two of four giant industrial modules for the Arctic LNG 2 project of Novatek, the largest independent natural gas producer of Russia, on August 26, 2021. The modules dispatched from Zhoushan shipyard were slated to arrive in Russia's Arctic port city of Murmansk after 25 days. On September 21, 2021. Arctic LNG 2 LLC announced that the first modules for LNG Train 1 were successfully delivered. The two first pipe-rack modules weighing approximately nine thousand tons each were shipped from the Zhoushan port in China to the NOVATEK-Murmansk LNG Construction Center and were to be further skidded onto the Gravity Base Structure, or GBS, platform of LNG Train 1. The next two modules were loaded onto a transport ship and put in transit to Murmansk. Overall, 14 modules are schedule to be delivered from contractors' shipyards for the first LNG train. By the end of the third quarter 2021, the project had achieved a 52% completion rate and the first train was roughly 69% complete.   However, the project encountered significant implementation obstacles and delays in 2022. Technip Energies warned in April 2022 that international sanctions (resulting from Russia's military invasion of Ukraine), would complicate the completion of the project. Technip’s CEO Arnaud Pieton said at the time that '[t]he European sanctions now target LNG goods and technology and services more directly, I would say, making the execution of [Arctic LNG 2] more complicated, maybe even highly complicated.' Then, work on train three was halted on on April 29, 2022 and work on train two was halted on May 27, 2022. All foreign workers were to leave their work sites by the end of May 2022, which placed the borrowing institution (Arctic LNG 2 LLC) and its contractors in a race against time to procure essential equipment and technology before deliveries to Russia became much harder or impossible. However, in January 2023, Novatek ordered Chinese yards to restart work on LNG modules destined for the Arctic LNG 2 Project, after an eight-month hiatus in activities related European sanctions on Russia.   There are also indications that the Arctic LNG 2 Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of its lenders. In February 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued Directive 3 Under Executive Order 14024, which prohibited U.S. persons from engaging in all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of greater than 14 days maturity and new equity issued by 13 Russian state-owned enterprises and entities, as well as their subsidiaries, on or after March 26, 2022. The entities included Transneft, Sberbank, AlfaBank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Rostelecom, RusHydro, Alrosa, Sovcomflot, and Russian Railways. Then, on March 5, 2022, the Russian Government issued Presidential Decree No. 95, which required that Russian borrowers make payments to foreign creditors from ‘unfriendly states’—including most countries that imposed sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine—in Russian rubles (irrespective of the currency of the loan), unless a permission to make direct payments in the contractual currency was granted by either the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) or Russia’s Ministry of Finance. This measure made it substantially more difficult for Russian borrowers to make timely payments on foreign- and local-currency debt to certain international creditors in their original currencies of denomination.  Then, in June 2022, the Russian Government defaulted on some of its dollar-denominated and euro-denominated debt.  Two months earlier, in April 2022, France’s Total, announced a $4.1 billion impairment and Japan's Mitsui & Co, Ltd. decided to take a write-off related to its 10 percent equity stake in the Arctic LNG 2 Project. Mitsui & Co, Ltd. reported that it had recorded a loss of $162 million related to its investment in project as a result of higher loan and guarantee obligations stemming from a worsening Russian credit rating. The fact that at least two of Arctic LNG 2 LLC's lenders (Sberbank and Gazprombank) faced international sanctions in 2022 and 2023 also complicated the implementation of the project.","1.

The loan were issued by six local banks, including Turkish banks (Türkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Is Bankasi A.S., QNB Finansbank A.S., T.C. Ziraat Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. and Türkiye Vakiflar Bankasi T.A.O.). One loan will mature in December 2022 (with a fixed interest rate of 7.6%) and the other will mature in June 2024 (with a floating interest rate of LIBOR + 550 basis points).   Additionally, $600 million of equity financing was provided by Astaldi S.P.A and IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S.: $387.33 million IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S. and $193.67 million from Astaldi S.P.A. The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee, agreeing to repay the debt incurred by borrower/project company (IC Ictas-Astaldi) in the event that it defaulted on its repayment obligations. The Government of Turkey’s General Directorate of Highways (KGM) also provided a minimum traffic guarantee to the project company (to secure the payback of the debt and equity if the generated revenue was insufficient).   Then, in 2018, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's branch in Turkey (ICBC Turkey) was mandated by IC Ictas-Astaldi to lead and arrange syndication for the refinancing of $2.67 billion of debt used to construct the Third Bosphorus Bridge (or Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge) and North Marmara Motorway PPP Project. A letter of authorization for the refinancing was signed at the One Belt, One Road Investment and Financial Cooperation Summit in Ankara on July 26, 2018. Under the agreement, ICBC Turkey agreed in principle to facilitate the refinancing of the project, previously funded by the Turkish banking system, on more favorable terms.   Then, in September 2019, two syndicated loan agreements worth $4.435 billion were signed (with ICBC serving as the lead arranger) for the Kurtköy-Akyazı and Kınalı-Odayeri sections of the project: a $2,840,000,000 loan agreement was signed by KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. and a group of ten lenders (ICBC Turkey, Bank of China, Kuveyt Türk Katilim Bankasi A.S., Albaraka Türk Katılım Bankası A.Ş., Türkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Is Bankasi A.S., QNB Finansbank A.S., T.C. Ziraat Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. and Türkiye Vakiflar Bankasi T.A.O.) to refinance the $1.04 billion loan that was issued in September 2013 for the 171 km Kurtköy-Akyazı Section of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project and finance new/additional capex requirements as a result of changes in the project scope (that increased the total cost of the project’s 171 km Kurtköy-Akyazı Section to $3.646 billion); and a $1,595,000,000 loan was signed by KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. and a group of ten lenders (ICBC Turkey, Bank of China, Kuveyt Türk Katilim Bankasi A.S., Albaraka Türk Katılım Bankası A.Ş., Türkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Is Bankasi A.S., QNB Finansbank A.S., T.C. Ziraat Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. and Türkiye Vakiflar Bankasi T.A.O.) to refinance the $1.63 billion loan that was issued in September 2013 for the 90 km Kınalı-Odayeri Section of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project and finance new/additional capex requirements as a result of changes in the project scope (that increased the total cost of the project’s 90 km Kınalı-Odayeri Section to $2.077 billion). The two loans have two different maturity lengths, reflecting the different concession lengths of the two sponsors. The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee for both loans on September 16, 2019. The total amount that was reportedly provided (across both loans) by ICBC Turkey was $1 billion (as captured via Project ID#67325). Bank of China’s estimated contribution to both loans ($381,666,666) is captured via Project ID#67331.   Then, on December 2, 2021, ICBC and KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. signed a $1,198,302,550 loan agreement (captured via Project ID#96108) to refinance a $2,138,000,000 loan that was issued on May 13, 2014 signed in 2014 and a $420,000,000 loan that was issued on March 11, 2016 for the Odayeri-Paşaköy Section of the Northern Marmara Motorway (including Third Bosphorus Bridge) Project. The borrowing terms of the ICBC loan are unknown.  The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee for the $1,198,302,550 loan on December 2, 2021.  The purpose of the project was to construct a 1.408 kilometer long-span bridge to be used by road vehicles and trains to cross the Bosphorus Strait from Poyrazkoy in Asia to Garipce in Europe, as well as the construction of a section of the North Marmara Highway along the Odayeri-Pasakoy route. The bridge is 59 meters long and it stretches 1,408 meters over the Bosporus, linking the European and Asian sides of Istanbul. It has eight highway lanes (4 in each direction), divided by two high-speed rail corridors of 1,048 meters. The bridge is a critical part of the larger Northern Marmara Highway (Motorway) Project, linking to the Odayeri-Pasaköy route of the Motorway. The 261 km km Northern Marmara Highway was intended to increase economic efficiency in Turkey, allow for greater access to Istanbul Airport, provide alternate routes to going through Istanbul, and start on the western side of Istanbul and end in the eastern Marmara province of Sakarya. ICA IC İçtaş Astaldi Üçüncü Boğaz Köprüsü ve Kuzey Marmara Otoyolu Yatırım ve İşletme A.Ş. (IC Ictas-Astaldi) was responsible for project implementation. Construction began in September 2012 using the SPV's equity, and was originally expected to take 36 months. The Odayeri-Paşaköy section of the motorway was completed August 26, 2016. The Kurtköy-Akyazı section of the project was completed and opened to traffic on December 19, 2020.   On December 23, 2019, China Merchants Expressway Network & Technology Holdings Co. Ltd, China Merchants Union (BVI) Limited, Jiangsu Expressway Company Limited, Zhejiang Expressway Co. Ltd., Anhui Expressway Company Limited and Sichuan Expressway Co announced that it had entered an agreement and jointly set up a consortium company (“Consortium Company”) to acquire: (1) 51% equity stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi (the SPV responsible for the Third Bosphorus Bridge PPP Project); (2) 51% of a related shareholder loan of IC Ictas-Astaldi; and (3) 51% equity stake in Eurasia Motorway Maintenance and Operations Limited (“IC Maintenance”), a company engages in the operations and maintenance of projects operated by IC Ictas-Astaldi. Shareholders of the Consortium Company expected to invest up to $688.5 million. As a part of the acquisition, China Merchants, China Merchants United, Zhejiang Expressway, Jiangsu Expressway, Sichuan Expressway and Anhui Expressway held 31%, 20%, 17.5%, 17.5%, 7% and 7% equity stakes in the Consortium Company, respectively. Upon completion of the acquisition, the Zhejiang Expressway Co., Ltd. would indirectly hold an 8.925% equity stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi, 8.925% of the related shareholder loan of IC Ictas-Astaldi, and an 8.925% equity stake in IC Maintenance, respectively. However, the preliminary agreement that was signed on December 23, 2019 was interrupted due to the Covid-19 pandemic. ICBC, Bank of China, and China Merchants Bank subsequently indicated that they were willing to issue a $1.6 billion loan to the Consortium Company in 2021 to facilitate their acquisition of a 51% ownership stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi for $688.5 million. Their loan would mature in 2027, just before the project company’s concession expired. Sinosure would provide credit insurance. However, IJ Global reported in August 2021 that the Chinese companies in the Consortium Company requested to enter into negotiations to terminate the acquisition agreement. Then, in March 2020, Astaldi sold its stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi (the SPV) to IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S., with the latter becoming the sole owner.","1.

# Title
ICBC provides $1.2 billion loan to KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi for the construction of the Odayeri-Paşaköy Section of the Northern Marmara Motorway (including Third Bosphorus Bridge) Project

# Description
On May 29, 2012, Turkey's Ministry of Transport granted a 10-year concession agreement to ICA IC İçtaş Astaldi Üçüncü Boğaz Köprüsü ve Kuzey Marmara Otoyolu Yatırım ve İşletme A.Ş. (IC Ictas-Astaldi or ICA) — a joint venture between an Italian construction company called Astaldi S.P.A (33.33% ownership stake) and a Turkish construction company called IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S. (66.66% ownership stake) — for the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project (also known as the Third Bosphorus Bridge PPP Project and the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge PPP Project). 30 months of the 10-year concession is for bridge construction activities and the remaining period is for bridge management activities. The public-private partnership (PPP) project was implemented on a BOT (Build, Operate, Transfer) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. The original, non-recourse $2.67 billion debt financing package consisted of two syndicated loan agreements with two different special purpose vehicles (project companies): a $1.04 billion loan with Avrupa Otoyolu Yatirim ve Iletme A.S. for the 171 km Kurtköy-Akyazı Section (“Asia Section” or “NMM Asia”) of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project and a $1.63 billion loan with KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. for the 90 km Kınalı-Odayeri Section (“Europe Section” or “NMM Europe”) of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project.

62223,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,"ICBC contributes $529 million to $659 million syndicated loan for Port Elizabeth II Upgrading and Expansion Project (Linked to Project ID#62222, #62224)","On March 25, 2015, the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone signed a framework agreement with a consortium of Chinese companies — consisting of Tidfore Heavy Equipment Group Co., Ltd., China Integrity International Oceaneering, Co., Ltd., Tidfore (Tianjin) Oceaneering Equipment Co., Ltd., and Tianjin Jinhao International Trade Co., Ltd. — regarding the design and construction of the works necessary for the expansion and upgrading of Port Elizabeth II in Freetown Port (also known as ‘Queen Elizabeth II Port’). Then, on September 15, 2017, the Sierra Leone Ports Authority, the National Commission for Privatization of the Republic of Sierra Leone, the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone, Sky Rock Management Limited, and National Port Development (SL) Ltd. signed a concession agreement in connection with the Upgrade and Expansion of the Queen Elizabeth II Port in Freetown. The agreement granted National Port Development (SL) Ltd. (塞拉利昂共和国国家港口发展有限公) — a project company and special purpose vehicle (SPV) — the right to expand, upgrade, and operate Queen Elizabeth II Port for 25 years.  On November 29, 2017, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of (ICBC) and the Export-Import Bank of China signed a $659 million syndicated facility (loan) agreement with National Port Development (SL) Ltd. for the Port Elizabeth II Upgrading and Expansion Project. Of the total $659 million (captured via Umbrella Project ID#62222), China Eximbank contributed $130 million (captured via Project ID#62224) and ICBC contributed $529 million (captured via Project ID#62223). The syndicated loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus 350 basis points, a 2% default (penalty) interest rate, and a commitment fee of 0.5%. The loan is secured by (i.e. collateralized against) project revenues/port development levy fees deposited in a lender-controlled bank account, the proceeds from the borrower’s Sinosure credit insurance policy, Sky Rock Management Ltd.’s equity stake (shares) in the project company [National Port Development (SL) Ltd.], project machinery and equipment, and all movable assets (tangible or intangible) of the concessionaire in connection with the ‘New Port’ (as defined in the concession agreement and AidData’s ‘Staff Comments’). Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development issued a sovereign guarantee for the loan, and the borrower was required to use part of the loan proceeds to purchase a credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure), which insures 95% of the facility plus accrued interest against political and commercial risk.  The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower, National Port Development (SL) Ltd., to finance a $708,295,101 commercial contract that it signed with a consortium of Chinese companies -- consisting of Tidfore Heavy Equipment Group Co., Ltd. (泰富重装集), China Integrity International Oceaneering, Co., Ltd., Tidfore (Tianjin) Oceaneering Equipment Co., Ltd., and Tianjin Jinhao International Trade Co., Ltd.-- which was signed on March 8, 2017 and amended on November 29, 2017. In order to facilitate loan repayment, Tidifore will collect a ‘development levy fee,’ which will be charged over and above the usual port handling charges. This fee is expected to generate $950 million over a 16 year period. Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development has reportedly flagged that this fee could raise the cost using the port to such a high level that shippers will avoid using it, thereby leading to an overall loss of revenue and threatening the borrower’s ability to repay the loan (thus raising concerns about the Government of Sierra Leone’s contingent liability).  The purpose of the Port Elizabeth II Upgrading Project is to renovate the facilities at Queen Elizabeth II Quay in Freetown, which is operated by Sierra Leone Ports Authority. It involves the design and construction of four new terminals and yards for the quay. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on November 29, 2017, and construction began in December 2017.  This project has become a source of local controversy and scrutiny. In 2018, the implementation of the project was reportedly halted (at least temporarily) after reports emerged that the legal entity responsible for the project—National Port Development (SL) Ltd.—was owned by Israeli businessman who had generously contributed to the President of Sierra Leone’s reelection campaign during the previous year. The IMF also sounded the alarm after learning that Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee in support of a syndicated loan, which placed an extraordinarily large contingent liability (worth 15% of the country’s GDP) on the government’s books.","1. This project is also known as the Queen Elizabeth II Quay Upgrading Project. The Chinese project title is 重装塞拉利昂弗里敦伊丽莎白二世港改扩建工程建 or 塞拉利昂弗里敦伊丽莎白二世港改扩建工程建 or 弗里敦伊丽莎白二世港口改扩建工程 or 非洲塞拉利昂港口改扩建项目 or 弗里敦伊丽莎白二世港改扩建 or 弗里敦伊丽莎白二世港改扩建.2. AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate (5.126%) by adding 3.5% to average 6-month LIBOR rate during the month (November 2017) when the loan agreement was finalized (1.626%).3. This loan is not included in the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020.4. No sources explicitly state that this is a buyer's credit loan. AidData assumes this is the case for the following reasons: (1) The loan is provided to a foreign borrower, (2) the loan is denominated in USD, (3) the face value of the loan is explicitly identified in multiple official sources, (4) the loan is used to finance a commercial contract with a Chinese company, and (5) the loan was insured by Sinosure via its export buyer's credit insurance service, which is specifically used when banks are providing buyer's credit financing.5. The syndicated loan agreement can be accessed in its entirety via https://www.dropbox.com/s/9s9cun72yezhkds/ICBC%20Facility%20Agreement%20with%20National%20Port%20Development%20%28SL%29%20LTD..pdf?dl=0.6.

The concession agreement can be accessed in its entirety via https://www.dropbox.com/s/asxeufc4d8ekfhp/Concession%20Agreement%20No.354.pdf?dl=0.8. The Facility Agreement references the following Security Documents: (a) Share Pledge Agreement: Sky Rock Ltd., the foreign investor, enters a share pledge agreement ‘in respect of their shares in the Borrower in favour of the Security Agent, in form and substance satisfactory to the Facility Agent’ (p. 18). The Share Pledge Agreement is separate from the Facility Agreement and not publicly available, so it is unknown under what circumstances ownership in the project company could be transferred from the foreign investor to the creditors. (b) Mortgage over Assets: The Borrower enters a mortgage agreement over ‘equipment and other assets of the Borrower in relation to the Project […] in favour of the Finance Parties, in form and substance satisfactory to the Facility Agent’ (p. 13). The Mortgage Agreement is separate from the Facility Agreement and not public, so it is unknown which assets are pledged. (c) Other security documents which evidence or create ‘security over any asset of the Borrower to secure any obligation of the Borrower under the Finance Documents’ (p. 17). Since no other security documents are publicly available, no further details are known. In addition to the Security Documents, the Facility Agreement references an Account Agreement. Again, this is a separate document that is not publicly available. Cross references in the Facility Agreement show that ICBC and China Eximbank can designate ‘a bank outside the jurisdiction of Sierra Leone’ at which the ‘Bank Accounts are opened and maintained’ (p. 1). The conditions of utilization further reveal that the Borrower is required to transfer project revenue into this account so that the account balance at all times meets the minimum debt service coverage of ‘all principal scheduled to be paid and all interested expected to be payable under the Facility on the next Interest Payment Date’ (p. 16). In addition, the repayment of the loan is fully guaranteed by Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance. In particular, the Ministry ‘guarantees to ensure that if […] the balance of the Borrower Collection Account falls to an amount that is less than is required to meet the next Scheduled Debt Service payment […], the Guarantor shall pay, or procure to be paid, into that account, such amount as may be necessary to ensure that the balance of the account is equal to the amount of the next Scheduled Debt Service payment’ (p. 143). The Concession Agreement specifies that ‘the Concessionaire shall be entitled to create Security over its rights, title, and interest in the Port Development Levy Fees and the New Port Assets in favor of the Finance Parties for the purpose of the Financing provided that any such Security shall not continue for a period exceeding the Concession Term. The Concessionaire may enter into all such transactions, and may become party to the related debt obligations that may be evidenced or secured by the Finance Documents.’ Through the agreement, the Government of Sierra Leone granted the Concessionaire ‘a first ranking Security over all Port Development Levy Fees and New Port Assets.’ The concession agreement defines the ‘New Port’ as ‘four (4) Berths, and container, bulk Cargo or vehicle handling facilities (including quay walls and other infrastructure and superstructure and all fixtures, fittings and machinery, apparatus, equipment and any other moveable assets of any nature), navigation and navaid facilities, storage yards or warehouse, or any ancillary or auxiliary works relating to such Berths to be developed and constructed by the Concessionaire at the Queen Elizabeth II Quay in Freetown Siena Leone’; ‘New Port Assets’ as ‘any and all machinery and equipment attached to the land within the Exclusive Area and all movable assets (tangible or intangible) of the Concessionaire in connection with the New Port’; the ‘Existing Port Development Levy Fee’ as ‘the fees charged by the Concessionaire to the Existing Port Carriers in connection with the use of the Existing Port by the Existing Port Carriers in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Existing Port Development Levy Fee Act; the ‘New Port Development Levy Fee’ as the fee charged by the Concessionaire to the New Port Carriers in connection with the transhipment of containers, bulk Cargos or vehicles at the New Port by are New Port Carriers in accordance with the term of this Agreement and the New Port Development Levy Fee Act’; ‘Port Development Levy Fees’ as ‘the Existing Port Development Levy Fee and the New Port Development Levy Fee’; and ‘Security’ as ‘mortgage, charge, pledge, lien, or other security interest securing any obligation of any Person or any other agreement or arrangement having a similar effect.’ The Government of Sierra Leone granted the Concessionaire ‘a first ranking Security over all Port Development Levy Fees and New Port Assets’.

ICBC contributes $529 million to $659 million syndicated loan for Port Elizabeth II Upgrading and Expansion Project (Linked to Project ID#62222, #62224)

# Description
On March 25, 2015, the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone signed a framework agreement with a consortium of Chinese companies — consisting of Tidfore Heavy Equipment Group Co., Ltd., China Integrity International Oceaneering, Co., Ltd., Tidfore (Tianjin) Oceaneering Equipment Co., Ltd., and Tianjin Jinhao International Trade Co., Ltd. — regarding the design and construction of the works necessary for the expansion and upgrading of Port Elizabeth II in Freetown Port (also known as ‘Queen Elizabeth II Port’). Then, on September 15, 2017, the Sierra Leone Ports Authority, the National Commission for Privatization of the Republic of Sierra Leone, the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone, Sky Rock Management Limited, and National Port Development (SL) Ltd. signed a concession agreement in connection with the Upgrade and Expansion of the Queen Elizabeth II Port in Freetown. The agreement granted National Port Development (SL) Ltd. (塞拉利昂共和国国家港口发展有限公) — a project company and special purpose vehicle (SPV) — the right to expand, upgrade, and operate Queen Elizabeth II Port for 25 years.  On November 29, 2017, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of (ICBC) and the Export-Import Bank of China signed a $659 million syndicated facility (loan) agreement with National Port Development (SL) Ltd. for the Port Elizabeth II Upgrading and Expansion Project. Of the total $659 million (captured via Umbrella Project ID#62222), China Eximbank contributed $130 million (captured via Project ID#62224) and ICBC contributed $529 million (captured via Project ID#62223). The syndicated loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus 350 basis points, a 2% default (penalty) interest rate, and a commitment fee of 0.5%. The loan is secured by (i.e. collateralized against) project revenues/port development levy fees deposited in a lender-controlled bank account, the proceeds from the borrower’s Sinosure credit insurance policy, Sky Rock Management Ltd.’s equity stake (shares) in the project company [National Port Development (SL) Ltd.], project machinery and equipment, and all movable assets (tangible or intangible) of the concessionaire in connection with the ‘New Port’ (as defined in the concession agreement and AidData’s ‘Staff Comments’). Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development issued a sovereign guarantee for the loan, and the borrower was required to use part of the loan proceeds to purchase a credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure), which insures 95% of the facility plus accrued interest against political and commercial risk.  The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower, National Port Development (SL) Ltd., to finance a $708,295,101 commercial contract that it signed with a consortium of Chinese companies -- consisting of Tidfore Heavy Equipment Group Co., Ltd. (泰富重装集), China Integrity International Oceaneering, Co., Ltd., Tidfore (Tianjin) Oceaneering Equipment Co., Ltd., and Tianjin Jinhao International Trade Co., Ltd.-- which was signed on March 8, 2017 and amended on November 29, 2017. In order to facilitate loan repayment, Tidifore will collect a ‘development levy fee,’ which will be charged over and above the usual port handling charges. This fee is expected to generate $950 million over a 16 year period. Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development has reportedly flagged that this fee could raise the cost using the port to such a high level that shippers will avoid using it, thereby leading to an overall loss of revenue and threatening the borrower’s ability to repay the loan (thus raising concerns about the Government of Sierra Leone’s contingent liability).  The purpose of the Port Elizabeth II Upgrading Project is to renovate the facilities at Queen Elizabeth II Quay in Freetown, which is operated by Sierra Leone Ports Authority. It involves the design and construction of four new terminals and yards for the quay. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on November 29, 2017, and construction began in December 2017.  This project has become a source of local controversy and scrutiny. In 2018, the implementation of the project was reportedly halted (at least temporarily) after reports emerged that the legal entity responsible for the project—National Port Development (SL) Ltd.—was owned by Israeli businessman who had generously contributed to the President of Sierra Leone’s reelection campaign during the previous year. The IMF also sounded the alarm after learning that Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee in support of a syndicated loan, which placed an extraordinarily large contingent liability (worth 15% of the country’s GDP) on the government’s books.

1. This project is also known as the Queen Elizabeth II Quay Upgrading Project. The Chinese project title is 重装塞拉利昂弗里敦伊丽莎白二世港改扩建工程建 or 塞拉利昂弗里敦伊丽莎白二世港改扩建工程建 or 弗里敦伊丽莎白二世港口改扩建工程 or 非洲塞拉利昂港口改扩建项目 or 弗里敦伊丽莎白二世港改扩建 or 弗里敦伊丽莎白二世港改扩建.2. AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate (5.126%) by adding 3.5% to average 6-month LIBOR rate during the month (November 2017) when the loan agreement was finalized (1.626%).3. This loan is not included in the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020.4. No sources explicitly state that this is a buyer's credit loan. AidData assumes this is the case for the following reasons: (1) The loan is provided to a foreign borrower, (2) the loan is denominated in USD, (3) the face value of the loan is explicitly identified in multiple official sources, (4) the loan is used to finance a commercial contract with a Chinese company, and (5) the loan was insured by Sinosure via its export buyer's credit insurance service, which is specifically used when banks are providing buyer's credit financing.5. The syndicated loan agreement can be accessed in its entirety via https://www.dropbox.com/s/9s9cun72yezhkds/ICBC%20Facility%20Agreement%20with%20National%20Port%20Development%20%28SL%29%20LTD..pdf?dl=0.6.

The concession agreement can be accessed in its entirety via https://www.dropbox.com/s/asxeufc4d8ekfhp/Concession%20Agreement%20No.354.pdf?dl=0.8. The Facility Agreement references the following Security Documents: (a) Share Pledge Agreement: Sky Rock Ltd., the foreign investor, enters a share pledge agreement ‘in respect of their shares in the Borrower in favour of the Security Agent, in form and substance satisfactory to the Facility Agent’ (p. 18). The Share Pledge Agreement is separate from the Facility Agreement and not publicly available, so it is unknown under what circumstances ownership in the project company could be transferred from the foreign investor to the creditors. (b) Mortgage over Assets: The Borrower enters a mortgage agreement over ‘equipment and other assets of the Borrower in relation to the Project […] in favour of the Finance Parties, in form and substance satisfactory to the Facility Agent’ (p. 13). The Mortgage Agreement is separate from the Facility Agreement and not public, so it is unknown which assets are pledged. (c) Other security documents which evidence or create ‘security over any asset of the Borrower to secure any obligation of the Borrower under the Finance Documents’ (p. 17). Since no other security documents are publicly available, no further details are known. In addition to the Security Documents, the Facility Agreement references an Account Agreement. Again, this is a separate document that is not publicly available. Cross references in the Facility Agreement show that ICBC and China Eximbank can designate ‘a bank outside the jurisdiction of Sierra Leone’ at which the ‘Bank Accounts are opened and maintained’ (p. 1). The conditions of utilization further reveal that the Borrower is required to transfer project revenue into this account so that the account balance at all times meets the minimum debt service coverage of ‘all principal scheduled to be paid and all interested expected to be payable under the Facility on the next Interest Payment Date’ (p. 16). In addition, the repayment of the loan is fully guaranteed by Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance. In particular, the Ministry ‘guarantees to ensure that if […] the balance of the Borrower Collection Account falls to an amount that is less than is required to meet the next Scheduled Debt Service payment […], the Guarantor shall pay, or procure to be paid, into that account, such amount as may be necessary to ensure that the balance of the account is equal to the amount of the next Scheduled Debt Service payment’ (p. 143). The Concession Agreement specifies that ‘the Concessionaire shall be entitled to create Security over its rights, title, and interest in the Port Development Levy Fees and the New Port Assets in favor of the Finance Parties for the purpose of the Financing provided that any such Security shall not continue for a period exceeding the Concession Term.

# Description
On August 31, 2018, Zijin Mining Group purchased a 63% ownership stake in Rudarsko-Topioničarski Basen RTB Bor Doo (or ‘RTB Bor’) — a state-owned copper mining and smelting complex located in Bor, Serbia — in a $1.26 billion deal with the Government of Serbia. The agreement was part of the Government of Serbia’s broader efforts to sell-off indebted state-run companies to help spur growth and relieve pressure on the budget, as recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). As part of the agreement, Zijin Mining Group promised to cover RTB Bor’s $200 million debt and keep 5,000 jobs at the mine. Out of the $1.26 billion, Zijin Mining Group said that $135 million would be invested in improving the environment while another $320 million in opening a new copper mine.
