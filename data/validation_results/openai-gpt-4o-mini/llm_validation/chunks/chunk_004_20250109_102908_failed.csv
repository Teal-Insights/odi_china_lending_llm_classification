64776,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides $321 million government concessional loan for Banha-Sekong Power Transmission Project,"On May 16, 2017, China Eximbank and the Ministry of Finance of Laos signed a $321 million government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Banha-Sekong Power Transmission Project. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance a $321 million commercial (EPC) contract between Électricité du Laos (EDL) — the state corporation of Laos that owns and operates the country's electricity generation, electricity transmission and electricity distribution assets — and China Gezhouba Group Company Limited (CGGC), which was signed on October 13, 2016.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 237-kilometer 500kV high-voltage transmission lines (measuring 237 km in length) and two 230kv substations in Champasak, Attapeu, Saravan, and Sekong provinces. Ultimately, the project sought to connect the power grids in the southern and central regions of Laos, improve the supply and stability of power to the southern region, and increase the export of electricity to earn foreign exchange.   China Energy Construction Guangxi Institute was the contractor responsible for project design. CGGC was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Project implementation commenced on January 12, 2018. On October 7, 2019, the 230 kV Banha Substation which is part of the project, was put into operation. Then, on November 1, 2020, a 18.573 km 500Kv double-circuit transmission line from Banha substation to the Cambodian border was completed.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Banha-Sekong Power Transmission Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. Laos’ gross foreign exchange reserves were dangerously low between 2019 and 2021, hovering between 1.4 and 2.3 months of import cover, and total public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt increased from 68 percent of GDP ($12.5 billion) in 2019 to 88 percent in 2021 of GDP (or $14.5 billion). According to a report published by the World Bank in April 2022, ‘[t]he energy sector, mostly represented by Électricité du Laos (EDL), accounted for over 30 percent of total PPG debt in 2021. […] EDL’s debt service obligations [were] still unsustainable [at the time], with future debt service accounting for about two fifths of EDL’s total operating revenue.’ The Laotian authorities sought and secured debt service payment deferrals from their Chinese creditors in 2020 and 2021; according to the World Bank, ‘[d]ebt service deferrals granted by major lenders in 2020-2021 amounted around 3.6 percent of GDP in 2021’ and ’[a]s a result, actual debt service payments are estimated to have declined to 48 percent of total revenues in 2021, compared to 65 percent in the 2021 [Government of Laos] plan.’  The country’s central bank (Bank of the Lao P.D.R) also made a $300 million drawdown under its currency swap agreement with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in June 2020 — when its gross reserves stood at only 1.5 months of import cover and credit rating agencies warned of a high default probability. Then, in 2021, the short-term emergency loan from the PBOC was ‘rolled over’ for another year. Around the same time, a Chinese state-owned enterprise purchased a major public infrastructure asset in Laos—a large part of the country’s electricity transmission grid—from EDL as part of an apparent debt-for-equity swap. China Southern Power Grid Co. and EDL established a joint venture known as Électricité du Laos Transmission Company Limited (EDLT) in September 2020.  China Southern Power Grid Co. purchased a 90% ownership stake in EDLT in exchange for a $600 million fee (equity infusion). Then, in March 2021, EDLT signed a 25-year concession agreement, which made it responsible for management of the country’s high-voltage transmission network above 230 kilovolts. Independent observers suggested at the time that EDL would likely use the $600 million upfront payment from China Southern Power Grid Co. to service its outstanding debts to Chinese creditors, although this has not been independently confirmed. According to the World Bank’s International Debt Statistics, the Government of Laos was responsible for making average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $232 million between 2019 and 2019 and average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $60 million between 2020 and 2021 (a substantially lower figure due to payment deferrals); however, it expected to make average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth nearly $678 million over the next seven years (2022-2028).","1.

China Eximbank permitted DBK to draw down up to $5 billion from a master facility agreement (MFA), which included an unrestricted $1.5 billion tranche and a restricted $3.5 billion tranche. The agreement was for a period of up to 15 years and it prohibited DBK from incurring indebtedness exceeding 25% of its assets or disposing of over 25% of its assets, in addition to a change of control clause favoring China Eximbank. The restricted portion of the MFA was for projects with a Chinese component, whereas the unrestricted portion was for DBK’s general purposes.   The restricted portion of the China Eximbank MFA was aimed at the development of energy, transport and communication infrastructure and the funding of strategic projects in the metallurgy, chemical, and oil industries. The proceeds from this credit facility were also be used for investment projects of Kazakhstani companies, including the exporting of industrial output, services and equipment to China.

89473,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,"Sinohydro provides $46.8 million — via deferred payment agreement — for Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads (Phase 1, Lot 7) Project (Linked to Project ID#60154)","On May 16, 2018, the Government of Ghana signed a master project support agreement (MPSA) with Sinohydro Corporation Limited (‘Sinohydro’) for an amount of up to $2 billion for the construction of priority infrastructure projects. The MPSA was then approved by Ghana’s Parliament on July 28, 2018. All borrowings that take place under the MPSA carry a maturity of 15 years, a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.80% margin, a 2% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.70% management fee, a 0.50% commitment fee, and a lump sum Sinosure insurance premium of 7%. Loan repayments will be made with the proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite (after the Government of Ghana establishes a bauxite processing plant), with repayments starting approximately three years after the effective date of the agreement. The proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite will be placed in an offshore escrow account by the offtaker for the benefit of Ghana Integrated Aluminium Development Corporation (GIADC) and Sinohydro.    If the value of bauxite decreases, or if bauxite reserves are lower than expected, the Government of Ghana may have to deliver higher volumes of bauxite than anticipated or find alternative means of repayment. While the Government of Ghana does not currently treat borrowings (via deferred payment agreements or DPAs) under the Sinohydro MPSA as external debt, depending on various factors and events and as a result of the deferred payment structure, they could in the future become repayment obligations of the Government of Ghana. The agreement structure seeks to ensure that the obligations of GIADC (the obligor) will not add to the Government of Ghana’s debt stock. If GIADC fails to comply with its collateral or repayment obligations, Sinohydro is entitled to prepayment of outstanding loan balances and may seize the full balance of the escrow account.   Sinohydro, which is itself borrowing from China Construction Bank to finance infrastructure projects under the MPSA, decided to approve funding for infrastructure projects under the MPSA in phases. The first phase consists of 10 road projects (underpinned by 10 EPC contracts) that are collectively worth $646,637,879.74: Accra Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 1 Project), Kumasi Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 2 Project), Tamale Interchange Project (or Phase 1, Lot 3 Project), PTC Interchange Takoradi Project (or Phase 1, Lot 4 Project and the PTC Roundabout Interchange Project, Takoradi), Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway Project (or Phase 1, Lot 5 Project and the Construction of 14 km Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway Project), Sunyani Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 6 Project), Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 7 Project), Upgrading of Selected Feeder Roads in Ashanti and Western Region Project (or Phase 1, Lot 8 Project, Rehabilitation of Oda Ofoase-Abirem Road Project (or Phase 1, Lot 9 Project and 38 km Rehabilitation of New Abirem-Afoasekuma-Akim Oda Road project), and Hohoe-Jasikan-Dodi Pepesu Road Project (or Phase 1, Lot 10 Project and 56.40 km Construction of Hohoe-Jasikan-Dodo Pepesu Road Project).    Each of these projects is being financed through a separate DPA. Under the terms of the MPSA, 'deferred payments' refer to payments due to Sinohydro under a given EPC contract to be made by Ghana's Ministry of Finance using the proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite that have been deferred up to the repayment dates stipulated in the repayment schedules of the DPAs. The DPA for the Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads (Phase 1, Lot 7) Project was signed by Ghana’s Ministry of Roads and Highways, Ghana’s Ministry of Finance, and Sinohydro on September 1, 2018. Under this DPA, which is captured via Project ID#89473, Sinohydro provided $46,852,015.86 of financing to cover 85% of the total cost of the EPC contract ($35,817,641.64) plus the cost of accrued interest and fees during the 30-month construction period.    The scope of the Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads (Phase 1, Lot 7) Project covers construction of the roads in the Western Region and Central Region (specifically, Cape Coast and Prestea inner city roads). The project, which was originally expected to be completed within a period of 30 months, involves 22 km of Cape Coast roads, 3 km of Akotokyir Area roads, 7 km of Abura New Community Area Roads, 3 km of Polytechnic Area Roads, 3 km of Apawusika Roads and Links, and 10.19 km of Prestea Town Roads.

The lenders for the project are Akbank, Finansbank, Ziraat Bank, Garanti Bank, Halk Bank, Is Bank, VakıfBank, Yapı ve Kredi Bank, Deutsche Bank, Saudi National Commercial Bank, Bank of China and Siemens Bank. The Turkish lenders (Akbank, Finansbank, Ziraat Bank, Garanti Bank, Halk Bank, Is Bank, VakıfBank, Yapı ve Kredi Bank) provided eight-ninths of the total loan amount ($4.405 billion) equally among themselves, while the four foreign lenders (Deutsche Bank, Saudi National Commercial Bank, Bank of China and Siemens Bank) provided the remaining one-ninth of the total loan amount ($550.66 million).
