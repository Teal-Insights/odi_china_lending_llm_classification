30346,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides RMB 426 million government concessional loan for Djibouti Assal Lake Salt Export Terminal Project at the Port of Goubet,"On November 11, 2012, the Chinese Government and the Government of Djibouti signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the Djibouti Assal Lake Salt Export Terminal Project at the Port of Goubet. Then, on November 19, 2012, China Eximbank and Djibouti’s Ministry of Finance signed an RMB 426,000,000 (FDJ 11,400,000,000/$63,998,908) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Djibouti Assal Lake Salt Export Terminal Project at the Port of Goubet. The borrowing terms of the GCL were as follows: a 7.5-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, a 2.5% interest rate, a 0.5% management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee. According to Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry, the GCL (loan) had achieved a 20.8% disbursement rate as of 2014 ($13,354,884 out of $63,998,908) and it ultimately achieved a 82.4% disbursement rate (FDJ 9,388,000,000 out of FDJ 11,400,000,000).  The cargo facility at the Port of Goubet was designed to facilitate the export of salt and gypsum deposits from Lake Assal, the world’s largest undeveloped salt reserve and the second most saline body of water on Earth after Don Juan Pond in Antarctica. This project sought to create a port with a depth of 14 meters, and a terminal bulk carrier located 17 meters from the extraction zone. The project also involved the rehabilitation of a 8.4 km road connecting the terminal to the extraction zone. The Port of Goubet is located 40 km south of the Gulf of Goubet, and its construction was designed to help Djibouti export 5 million tons of salt annually to Southeast Asian countries.   China Harbor Engineering Company Ltd., a subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company Ltd., was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on November 7, 2013, and the President of Djibouti inaugurated the mineral port on June 22, 2017.    The completion of this project paved the way for a longer-term commercial investment by China Harbor Engineering Company Ltd. and China Communications Construction Company Ltd.. In 2015, CCCC Resource — a joint venture of Overseas Business Department of China Communications Construction Company Ltd. and China Harbor Engineering Company Ltd. — purchased a 65% equity stake in Djibouti Salt Investment Company (吉布提鹽業投資公司 or SIS). Then, on August 22, 2017, the Government of Djibouti and Djibouti Salt Investment Company signed a concession agreement, which granted Djibouti Salt Investment Company the exclusive rights to develop and extract salt and bromine resources from Lake (Lac) Assal and develop a salt chemical (sodium bromide) industrial park for 50 years. Lake Assal reportedly contains around 2 billion tons of salt minerals that had previously been harvested only in small quantities through traditional methods.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Djibouti Assal Lake Salt Export Terminal Project at the Port of Goubet may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the stock of the Government of Djibouti's external arrears -- including arrears to China, Belgium, Spain, Iran, Italy, Saudi Arabia, and UAE -- stood at $107 million in March 2020. Then, in May 2020, a Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) by the World Bank and the IMF concluded that Djibouti was at a high risk of debt distress. Then, on November 29, 2022, the South China Morning Post reported that the Government of Djibouti had suspended debt service payment to China Eximbank. Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry responded to the South China Morning Post report by releasing a public statement on December 7, 2022.

China Eximbank provides RMB 426 million government concessional loan for Djibouti Assal Lake Salt Export Terminal Project at the Port of Goubet

# Description
On November 11, 2012, the Chinese Government and the Government of Djibouti signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the Djibouti Assal Lake Salt Export Terminal Project at the Port of Goubet. Then, on November 19, 2012, China Eximbank and Djibouti’s Ministry of Finance signed an RMB 426,000,000 (FDJ 11,400,000,000/$63,998,908) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Djibouti Assal Lake Salt Export Terminal Project at the Port of Goubet. The borrowing terms of the GCL were as follows: a 7.5-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, a 2.5% interest rate, a 0.5% management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee. According to Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry, the GCL (loan) had achieved a 20.8% disbursement rate as of 2014 ($13,354,884 out of $63,998,908) and it ultimately achieved a 82.4% disbursement rate (FDJ 9,388,000,000 out of FDJ 11,400,000,000).  The cargo facility at the Port of Goubet was designed to facilitate the export of salt and gypsum deposits from Lake Assal, the world’s largest undeveloped salt reserve and the second most saline body of water on Earth after Don Juan Pond in Antarctica. This project sought to create a port with a depth of 14 meters, and a terminal bulk carrier located 17 meters from the extraction zone. The project also involved the rehabilitation of a 8.4 km road connecting the terminal to the extraction zone. The Port of Goubet is located 40 km south of the Gulf of Goubet, and its construction was designed to help Djibouti export 5 million tons of salt annually to Southeast Asian countries.   China Harbor Engineering Company Ltd., a subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company Ltd., was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on November 7, 2013, and the President of Djibouti inaugurated the mineral port on June 22, 2017.    The completion of this project paved the way for a longer-term commercial investment by China Harbor Engineering Company Ltd. and China Communications Construction Company Ltd.. In 2015, CCCC Resource — a joint venture of Overseas Business Department of China Communications Construction Company Ltd. and China Harbor Engineering Company Ltd. — purchased a 65% equity stake in Djibouti Salt Investment Company (吉布提鹽業投資公司 or SIS). Then, on August 22, 2017, the Government of Djibouti and Djibouti Salt Investment Company signed a concession agreement, which granted Djibouti Salt Investment Company the exclusive rights to develop and extract salt and bromine resources from Lake (Lac) Assal and develop a salt chemical (sodium bromide) industrial park for 50 years. Lake Assal reportedly contains around 2 billion tons of salt minerals that had previously been harvested only in small quantities through traditional methods.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Djibouti Assal Lake Salt Export Terminal Project at the Port of Goubet may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the stock of the Government of Djibouti's external arrears -- including arrears to China, Belgium, Spain, Iran, Italy, Saudi Arabia, and UAE -- stood at $107 million in March 2020. Then, in May 2020, a Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) by the World Bank and the IMF concluded that Djibouti was at a high risk of debt distress. Then, on November 29, 2022, the South China Morning Post reported that the Government of Djibouti had suspended debt service payment to China Eximbank. Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry responded to the South China Morning Post report by releasing a public statement on December 7, 2022. The statement by the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry noted that the Government of Djibouti had honored 85% of its loan repayment obligations in 2022. It also acknowledged that, as part of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), China Eximbank agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due in 2020 and 2021 under multiple loan agreements, and that the Government of Djibouti’s debt service obligations tripled with the expiration of DSSI. Then, in 2023, Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry published a report, which identified the Government of Djibouti’s total arrears to China as being equivalent to DJF 24,104,000,000 ($135,285,797) as of December 31, 2022.

32192,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides RMB 3.53 billion overseas investment loan for 246 MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project,"On January 18, 2017, China National Heavy Machinery Corporation (CHMC) and the Cambodian Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) signed a feasibility study agreement regarding the 246 MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. The feasibility report was completed in June 2007. It was conducted by two Chinese firms: China Jikan Research Institute of Engineering Investigations and Design Co., Ltd. and Powerchina Northwest Engineering Corporation Limited. The feasibility report was then reviewed in September 2007 by a group of experts organized by China Hydropower Engineering Consulting Group Co. (CHECC) — a subsidiary of China Electric Power Construction Group Co., Ltd. — and again in February 2008 by Cambodia’s MME. Then, in June 2008, China National Heavy Machinery Corporation (CHMC) and the Cambodian Government signed a build-operate and transfer (BOT) agreement regarding the 246MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project.   The 42 year agreement includes a 5-year construction period (1 year for preparation and 4 years for construction) and a 37-year operating period. In addition, an execution agreement, power purchase agreement (PPA), and BOT land lease agreement were signed by CHMC, Cambodia’s Ministry of Economy and Finance, Cambodia’s MME, and Electricité du Cambodge (EDC) — a Cambodian state-owned power company — in June 2008. On November 17, 2008, China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) issued a letter of interest, which conveyed its willingness to provide insurance for the $540 million project. Two months later, on January 12, 2009, China Eximbank issued a letter of interest, which conveyed its willingness to provide a loan for the 246 MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. Then, in August 2009, China’s National Development and Reform Commission formally approved CHMC’s investment in the 246MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project, which enabled China Eximbank to grant credit support to the project.   On June 9, 2010, China Eximbank and Cambodian Tatay Hydropower Limited (CTHL or 柬埔寨達岱水電有限公司) — a special purpose vehicle and project company that is wholly owned by another special purpose vehicle called Beijing Sanlian International Investment Co., Ltd., which in turn is owned by China National Heavy Machinery Corporation (93.13% equity stake) and CHINT Group (6.88% equity stake) — signed an overseas investment loan (境外投资贷款) agreement worth RMB 3,533,622,000 for the 246 MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. The loan was issued in three tranches worth RMB 1,349,831,300, RMB 1,195,191,300, and RMB 988,599,400 yuan, respectively. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. The parties also signed a mortgage agreement, stipulating that CTHL would provide a mortgage guarantee for all its properties (tangible or intangible) and all rights (existing or in the future) to China Eximbank. Sinosure also provided insurance for the overseas investment loan.   The proceeds of the China Eximbank loan were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial (EPC) contract that it signed with China Gezhouba Group Company Limited (CGGC) on February 10, 2010. The purpose of the project was to construct a hydroelectric power plant with a new reservoir (whose water surface area is 16,000,000m2 with a power density of 15.375W/m2) downstream of the Tatay River in Thma Bang District and Koh Kong Province and thereby generate power from clean renewable hydropower in Koh Kong Province and contribute to the sustainability of the Phnom Penh Power Grid. It involved the installation of 3 sets of turbine and generators (3×82MW), which amount to a total capacity of 246MW and a total net electricity supply of 857,300MWh (to be sold to the Phnom Penh Power Grid). It relied upon technology manufactured by Zhejiang Fuchunjiang Hydropower Equipments Co., Ltd in China.   The project was a diversion type hydropower station. Two dams were constructed to form a new reservoir. The concrete face rock-fill dam was located on the main stream of Tatay river and the auxiliary dam was located in Stung Kep River which is a tributary of the Tatay River. The three-opening bank spillway was located on the left bank of the Stung Kep River. The headrace power system and the river-side ground powerhouse were located at the left bank of the Tatay River; access roads to the dam crest and project site were provided on the left bank. The maximum height of the main dam located on the main stream was 110 meters, and the maximum height of the dam located on the Stung Kep River was 77 meters. A new reservoir was formed with the water surface of 16,000,000m2 and the power density is 15.375W/m2 . The designed net water head for the power generation was 188 meters. The power generated by the plant was to be routed to the 230kV O-Saom Substation though a 65km 230kV transmission line to Phnom Penh power grid. The project required the excavation of 7 million m3 of earth and 900,000 m3 of stone, for an active water storage capacity estimated at 322 m3 and an overall reservoir capacity of 439 million m3.   The project is located in Thmabang District within Koh Kong (Khétt Kaôh Kông) Province, which has central geographical coordinates at powerhouse: 103°10′11″E, 11°35′23″N; dam on Tatay River: 103°15′44″E, 11°37′46″N (i.e. powerhouse: 103.1697°E, 11.5897°N; dam on Tatay River: 103.2622°E, 11.6294°N). The dam site of the proposed project is 1.4 km upstream of the junction between Tatay River and its tributary named Stung Kep and 40km away from Koh Kong City, the capital of Koh Kong Province. China Gezhouba Group Company Limited (CGGC or 中国葛洲坝集团股份有限公司) was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, Zhejiang Fuchunjiang Hydropower Equipment Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Zhefu Holding Group Ltd., was a subcontractor responsible for the dam’s three 82MW generators.    In June 2009, preliminary results from the project’s environmental impact assessment (EIA), conducted by Key Consultants Cambodia (KCC) on behalf of CTHL, were released at a public forum. The full EIA was completed in September 2010. Then, in February 2010, it was announced that CGGC had won the construction contract bid. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on May 21, 2009; however, construction did not begin until March 29, 2010. Then, on November 5, 2010, Mr. Li Ruogu, President of China Eximbank conducted a project site inspection. The main dam was finished before the 2011 rainy season, and the auxiliary dam and spillway capacity were completed one year later. The main dam was finished before the 2011 rainy season, and the auxiliary dam and spillway capacity were completed one year later. In 2012, the European consulting firm Pöyry accepted a two-year contract with CTHL to provide monitoring of dam engineering, design, construction, quality, materials, and safety until 2014. As of February 8, 2012, construction was reportedly 20% complete. The access tunnel was completed in February 2013. Then, on June 23, 2013, Cambodia experienced 50-year monsoonal rains, flooding the project and suspending much of the construction. CHMC quickly deployed rescue workers to move construction equipment and build dikes. By the next day, the flood was under control and the damage contained. By the fall of 2013, the main dam passed the gate-closing requirements as determined by a Chinese team of experts and reviewed by Pöyry. After approval, the gate was closed and water storage officially began on November 16, 2013. The diversion tunnels for both dams were also finished in November 2013.   The originally expected project completion date was November 30, 2013; however, the first of the dam’s three 82MW generators did not begin to produce electricity until August 13, 2014. CHMC Board Chairman and President Mr. Lu Wenjun, and Mr. Zhu Xu attended a grid connection and commissioning ceremony on August 13, 2014. By December 2015, all three 82MW generators were active and the dam was fully operational. A project acceptance and power generation ceremony took place on December 23, 2015. The ceremony was attended by both Prime Minister Hun Sen and Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Bu Jianguo. Then, in November 2019, China Eximbank conducted an on-site, post-loan inspection. Under terms of a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), China National Heavy Machinery Corporation (CHMC), the majority shareholder of project owner and operator CTHL’s parent company, sells the electricity generated by the power plant at 7.45 cents per kilowatt-hour to EDC, thereby generating approximately $12 million of tax revenue a year. All electric power generated by the hydropower station is sent to the Phnom Penh-Battambang transmission and distribution lines. Since operationalization, the dam’s three generators have had an average annual production capacity of 849 GW*h14 that, in 2020, represented almost 24 percent of Cambodia’s total hydropower generation (3,493 GW*h) and 10 percent of Cambodia’s total domestic electricity production (8,513 GW*h). The 246MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project qualified for Certified Emission Reduction (CER) credits via the CDM under the UNFCCC as a renewable power source. The CDM credit system projected the dam would provide an annual greenhouse gas emission reduction of 393,329 tons of CO2 equivalents. The CER credits guaranteed by the project were then sold to the Netherlands via Gazprom Marketing & Trading Singapore between September 2013 and 2020. The project was recently re-certified by Shenzhen CTI International Certification to allow the same credits to be sold to the Netherlands for the next seven years between September 2020 to August 2027.","1.

It purchased 98% of the plant's assets, saving the over 100-year-old plant from bankruptcy.    In order to support the acquisition from Železara Smederevo, the Hebei Branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) provided an EUR 27.6 million acquisition loan (captured via Project ID#95965) and an EUR 50 million working capital loan  (captured via Project ID#95935)  to Hesteel Group Company Limited. These loans were backed by a credit insurance policy from Sinosure. Then, in June 2016, Bank of China extended a $600 million loan  (captured via Project ID#67013) to Hesteel Group Company Limited to support the Zelezara Steel Mill Modernization Project.    The purpose of the project was to modernize the Zelezara Steel Mill in the city of Smederevo. Renamed Hesteel Serbia, the plant now employs over 5,000 workers, bringing local unemployment rates down to 6 percent from 18 percent. In 2017, the plant was expected to generate revenue of $800 million and a profit of $20 million. In 2018, the plant produced 1.77 million metric tons of steel, becoming Serbia’s largest exporter with sales of 750 million euros.    However, the Zelezara Steel Mill Modernization Project has also provoked local controversy. According to a November 2021 report from Reuters: “a few hundred meters from the huge furnaces of the Chinese-owned Smedrevo steel mill in central Serbia, the village of Radinac is covered in thick red dust. Cancer rates have quadrupled in under a decade, and residents want the plant to clean up or shut down. Zoran, 70, a throat cancer patient who speaks with a voice prosthesis after his larynx was removed, said residents must dry their laundry indoors and use vinegar to clean the dust from their cars. ‘Water cannot wash it off,’ he said. ‘We do not go out. We do not dare.’  According to data from the Smederevo public health body, which a watchdog called Tvrdjava obtained through a freedom of information request and shared with Reuters, the municipality of around 100,000 people reported 6,866 cancer cases in 2019, up from 1,738 in 2011. The plant says it has invested 300 million euros in technology and pollution reduction since China's biggest steelmaker, Hesteel […], bought it from the Serbian state for 46 million euros ($53 million) five years ago. ‘We are all citizens of Smederevo.... Would we be working despite pollution, against ourselves and our children?’ the plant's manager for environmental protection, Ljubica Drake, said in a statement to Reuters. Three new production facilities will significantly reduce pollution after their completion in 2022, she said. It was ‘not correct’ to conclude that higher cancer rates were caused by the plant's activities, she said, adding that the disease could be a result of NATO's bombing of Serbia in 1999 during a war in Kosovo. But activists say the plant is an example of Chinese-owned industrial firms ignoring pollution standards.    Nikola Krstic, the head of Tvrdjava, an environmental group whose name means The Fort, said an analysis of the red dust in September [2021] showed high concentration of heavy metals. ‘The air in the town is far below European standards for 120 days per year,’ he told Reuters. ‘Red dust is greasy, it sticks to lungs, makes breathing difficult.’  […] The authorities in Belgrade say they are prepared to challenge Chinese-owned companies over pollution’.",1.

ICBC provides EUR 27.6 million loan to Hesteel Group for acquisition of Zelezara steel mill (Linked to Project ID#67788, #52821, #67013, ID#95935)

# Description
On April 18, 2016, the Zelezara steel mill was bought by Hesteel Group Company Limited (also known as Hebei Iron and Steel Group Co., Ltd., HBIS, or 河北钢铁集团有限公司) — a Chinese state-owned steel company — for EUR 46 million. It purchased 98% of the plant's assets, saving the over 100-year-old plant from bankruptcy.    In order to support the acquisition from Železara Smederevo, the Hebei Branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) provided an EUR 27.6 million acquisition loan (captured via Project ID#95965) and an EUR 50 million working capital loan  (captured via Project ID#95935)  to Hesteel Group Company Limited. These loans were backed by a credit insurance policy from Sinosure. Then, in June 2016, Bank of China extended a $600 million loan  (captured via Project ID#67013) to Hesteel Group Company Limited to support the Zelezara Steel Mill Modernization Project.    The purpose of the project was to modernize the Zelezara Steel Mill in the city of Smederevo. Renamed Hesteel Serbia, the plant now employs over 5,000 workers, bringing local unemployment rates down to 6 percent from 18 percent. In 2017, the plant was expected to generate revenue of $800 million and a profit of $20 million. In 2018, the plant produced 1.77 million metric tons of steel, becoming Serbia’s largest exporter with sales of 750 million euros.    However, the Zelezara Steel Mill Modernization Project has also provoked local controversy. According to a November 2021 report from Reuters: “a few hundred meters from the huge furnaces of the Chinese-owned Smedrevo steel mill in central Serbia, the village of Radinac is covered in thick red dust.

The first is an RMB 400 million syndicated loan agreement with a 2.65% interest rate and a 10-year maturity. China Eximbank's contribution to the RMB-denominated facility is captured in Project ID#53985 and CDB's contribution to the RMB-denominated facility is captured in Project ID#92503. The second is a $62.6 million syndicated loan agreement with an interest rate of 4.96% (LIBOR plus 4.2%) and a 10-year maturity.   China Eximbank's contribution to the USD-denominated facility is captured in Project ID#54287 and CDB's contribution to the USD-denominated facility is captured in Project ID#92501. The borrower purchased credit insurance from Sinosure for both of these syndicated loans. The borrower, ASDPL, was expected to use the loan proceeds to partially finance two commercial (EPC) contracts that it signed on on June 27, 2015: an RMB 863.316 million offshore supply contract that it signed with China First Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd. and an RMB 135.683 million onshore construction contract with MCC Ruba International Construction Company (Pvt) Ltd. The total project cost was $149.154 million and it was financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 79:21. ASDPL achieved financial close on November 6, 2015, which is typically the date of the first loan disbursement.   The project was implemented on a build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) basis and it involved the construction of a 100 MW solar PV power plant located at Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park at Lal Sohanra in Cholistan within Bahawalpur District of the Province of Punjab. China First Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd and MCC Ruba International Construction Company (Pvt) Ltd were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. This project reached its commercial operations date (COD) on May 31, 2016.   However, this project has encountered debt repayment and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. In May 2022, reports emerged that the Government of Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to Zonergy and its subsidiaries/SPVs. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 10.4 billion (approximately $52 million). Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this “[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).","1. The project implementation start date is unknown. For the time being, AidData relies on the financial closure date as a proxy for the project implementation start date, since this is typically the date of the first loan disbursement. 2. According to multiple, official sources, the Government of Pakistan has issued sovereign guarantees in support of all loans issued by Chinese state-owned banks for independent power projects (IPPs) in Pakistan (see https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cepk/chn/zbgx/t1735166.htm and http://pk.chineseembassy.org/eng/zbgx/202110/t20211010_9558510.htm and https://www.dropbox.com/s/bmx3w2b38o7guxm/Debt%20Pricing%20of%20IPPs%20%28002%29.pdf?dl=0).

Then, in September 2017, the Power Division forwarded a draft Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) to be signed between Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guaranteed (CPPA-G) and power producer(s) to the Finance Division. CPPA-G subsequently executed the finalized draft of RAA with multiple CPEC IPPs. The Government of Pakistan also guaranteed the funding obligations of the CPPA with respect to the RAA, through Supplemental Implementation Agreements signed between the Government of Pakistan — through the Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) — and the respective IPPs. 5.

Then, on September 3, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Ghana signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 2.1 billion ($330 million). The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 17.2 year-maturity (final maturity date: November 21, 2025), a 5-year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2013), an interest rate of CIRR plus a margin of 0.75% (6.13%), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity (final maturity date: September 3, 2028), a 7 year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2015), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL is captured via Project ID#30801 and the BCL is captured via Project ID#183. The BCL was collateralized with (a) net revenue from a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between Bui Power Authority — an organization with a mandate to plan, execute and manage the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant Project — and the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) for the purchase of the energy to be generated from the Bui hydroelectric power plant, and (b) receivables from Ghana Cocoa Board’s sale of up to 30,000 tons of main crop cocoa and 10,000 tons of light crop cocoa per annum to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing under a 20-year, Cocoa Sales Agreement (CSA); and (c) and a mortgage of the land and building and equipment and machinery of the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant. The cocoa beans were sold at the prevailing market price rather than a fixed price, and the proceeds were to be placed in a Government of Ghana bank account to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). Then, once the dam was operational (and the cocoa agreement came to an end), 85% of the proceeds from sales of energy generated by the Bui hydroelectric power plant were to be placed in an escrow account held by China Eximbank to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). The borrower was expected to maintain a minimum cash balance in the escrow account. The escrow account balance was $27,275,000 in 2018 and $25,582,000 in 2019. The Government of Ghana bank account (for the cash proceeds from COCOBOD’s sale of cocoa to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing) had a balance of $167,816,000 in 2018 and $209,783,000 in 2019. The GCL, by contrast, was not collateralized; it was backed by the full faith and credit of the Government of Ghana. The borrower also purchased a buyer’s credit insurance policy from Sinosure at a cost of $25 million for the BCL (i.e. 8.5% of the face value of the BCL).  According to the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $293,506,062 loan (BCL) and the $330,000,000 loan (GCL) jointly achieved a 81.2% average disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 30 loan disbursements (worth $505,088,349.00) between 2009 and 2012: a $57,786,692.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #1) on May 15, 2009, a $35,217,544.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #2) on February 27, 2009, a $10,896,807.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #3) on October 26, 2009, a $27,469,679.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #4) on December 15, 2009, a $6,865,488.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #5) on January 18, 2010, a $9,390,036.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #6) on February 25, 2010, a $13,754,282.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #7) on May 9, 2010, a $18,208,899.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #8) on July 23, 2010, a $6,755,424.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #9) on July 23, 2010, a $8,919,668.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #10) on August 18, 2010, a $7,321,959.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #11) on September 20, 2010, a $6,563,979.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #12) on December 10, 2010, a $5,515,930.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #13) on December 6, 2010, a $107,904,311.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #14) on December 30, 2010, a $12,367,797.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #15) on February 28, 2011, a $8,689,838.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #16) on March 18, 2011, a $7,321,338.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #17) on April 28, 2011, a $6,870,418.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #18) on June 7, 2011, a $6,957,804.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #19) on July 22, 2011, a $16,330,457.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #20) on September 13, 2011, a $4,248,349.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #21) on October 31, 2011, a $4,071,390.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #22) on November 30, 2011, a $19,056,526.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #23) on December 28, 2011, a $5,071,871.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #24) on April 12, 2012, a $6,955,729.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #25) on April 12, 2012, a $14,889,380.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #26) on May 18, 2012, a $4,807,999.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #27) on June 22, 2012, a $48,355,586.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #28) on July 31, 2012, a $13,242,808.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #29) on October 12, 2012, and a $3,280,361.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #30) on November 30, 2012.  Two additional loans from China Eximbank were negotiated on April 30, 2012 to pay for cost overruns on the dam (the so-called ‘Supplementary Bui Hydroelectric Dam Project’): a $75.4 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) with a maturity of 20 years (final maturity date: April 30, 2032), a 5 year grace period (first repayment date: April 30, 2017), and a 2% interest rate and a $76,206,939 buyer’s credit loan (BCL) with a maturity of 13.5 years (final maturity date: November 21, 2025), a 2 year grace period (first repayment date: April 30, 2014), and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.731% in April 2012) plus a 4% margin. The $75.4 million PBC is captured via Project ID#30086 and the $76,206,939 BCL is captured via Project ID#30709. According to the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $75.4 million PBC and the $76,206,939 BCL jointly achieved a 54.7% average disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 8 loan disbursements (worth $82,949,965.55) between 2014 and 2017: a $18,800,258.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #39) on April 9, 2014, a $8,065,407.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #35) on December 19, 2014, a $1,538,389.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #36) on December 31, 2014, a $3,649,254.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #37) on December 31, 2014, a $6,937,499.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #38) on April 9, 2015, a $14,815,581.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #40) on July 16, 2015, a $12,775,468.25 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #41) on March 11, 2016, and a $16,368,109.30 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #42) on January 25, 2017.  The 2008 GCL's (principal) amount outstanding was $297,615,000 in 2018, $301,237,000 in 2019, GHS 926,830,000 ($165,505,357) in 2020, and GHS 889,400,000 ($171,038,461) in 2021. The 2012 PBC's amount outstanding was $78,582,000 in 2018, $78,583,000 in 2019, GHS 415,680,000 ($74,228,571) in 2020, and GHS 399,990,000 ($76,921,153) in 2021. The 2007 BCL’s amount outstanding was $166,166,000 in 2018, $143,051,000 in 2019, GHS 621,650,000 ($111,008,928) in 2020, and GHS 618,100,000 ($118,865,384) in 2021. The 2012 BCL’s amount outstanding was $41,348,000 in 2018, $37,137,000 in 2019, GHS 269,920,000 ($48,200,000) in 2020, and GHS 274,000,000 ($52,692,307) in 2021.  The 2008 GCL's amount outstanding was $297,615,000 in 2018 and $301,237,000 in 2019. The 2012 PBC's amount outstanding was $78,582,000 in 2018 and $78,583,000 in 2019. The 2007 BCL’s amount outstanding was $166,166,000 in 2018 and $143,051,000 in 2019. The 2012 BCL’s amount outstanding was $41,348,000 in 2018 and $37,137,000 in 2019.  The GCL and PBC were eventually rescheduled such that repayments would commence on July 15, 2023 and end on July 15, 2037, which implies a maturity extension of 8.8 years and a grace period extension of 7.8 years for the GCL and a maturity extension of 5.2 years and a grace period extension of 6.2 years for the PBC. The 2% interest rate that originally applied to both the GCL and PBC also increased to 2.7% as part of the rescheduling. The GCL rescheduling is captured via Project ID#95483. The PBC rescheduling is captured via Project ID#95484.  The Bui Dam Construction Project had six components: (1) a roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) gravity dam incorporating a 5-bay spillway; (2) three penstocks in the middle of the dam; (3) a powerhouse at the toe of the dam on the left bank; (4) two rock fill saddle dams on the right bank; (5) a switchyard; and (6) 276 km of transmission lines; and a permanent bridge downstream of the dam.   Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by Bui Power Authority. The dam was designed by the French engineering firm Coyne et Bellier, which also served as the consulting engineers on the project. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on August 24, 2007. However, construction did not begin until December 2, 2008. Then, on May 3, 2013, the first generator was inaugurated. The dam was inaugurated on December 19, 2013. However, the project was not completed and handed over to the Ghanaian authorities until November 28, 2016.   There are many indications that the China Eximbank loans for the Bui Dam Construction Project have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. First, in August 2017, the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod) — a state-owned company whose export receipts provide an important source of revenue for loan repayment to China Eximbank — told the country’s parliament it was in financial distress due to its loan repayment obligations related to the construction of the Bui Dam. Second, at least two of the four loans were rescheduled. Third, in April 2023, Samuel Kofi Dzamesi, the Chief Executive Officer of BPA revealed that the ECG had accumulated $612 million of payment arrears (overdue payments) to BPA. ECG’s payments to BPA for electricity purchases were originally intended to be the main source of revenue for repaying China Eximbank. Fourth, according to the World Bank’s International Development Statistics, the Government of Ghana had accumulated principal and interest arrears to one or more official sector Chinese creditors worth $908,337,346.70) in 2020 ($763,228,526.60 in principal arrears and $145,108,820.10 in interest arrears). Fifth, on December 19, 2022, the Government of Ghana announced a sovereign default, suspending debt service on its Eurobonds, its commercial loans, and most of its bilateral loans.","1. The precise dates on which the GCL and PBC rescheduling agreements were signed are unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes that each loan was rescheduled on the calendar day when it was originally scheduled to enter its repayment period (September 3, 2015 for the GCL and April 30, 2017 for the PBC). This issue merits further investigation.","# Sector

The 2012 PBC's amount outstanding was $78,582,000 in 2018, $78,583,000 in 2019, GHS 415,680,000 ($74,228,571) in 2020, and GHS 399,990,000 ($76,921,153) in 2021. The 2007 BCL’s amount outstanding was $166,166,000 in 2018, $143,051,000 in 2019, GHS 621,650,000 ($111,008,928) in 2020, and GHS 618,100,000 ($118,865,384) in 2021. The 2012 BCL’s amount outstanding was $41,348,000 in 2018, $37,137,000 in 2019, GHS 269,920,000 ($48,200,000) in 2020, and GHS 274,000,000 ($52,692,307) in 2021.  The 2008 GCL's amount outstanding was $297,615,000 in 2018 and $301,237,000 in 2019. The 2012 PBC's amount outstanding was $78,582,000 in 2018 and $78,583,000 in 2019. The 2007 BCL’s amount outstanding was $166,166,000 in 2018 and $143,051,000 in 2019. The 2012 BCL’s amount outstanding was $41,348,000 in 2018 and $37,137,000 in 2019.  The GCL and PBC were eventually rescheduled such that repayments would commence on July 15, 2023 and end on July 15, 2037, which implies a maturity extension of 8.8 years and a grace period extension of 7.8 years for the GCL and a maturity extension of 5.2 years and a grace period extension of 6.2 years for the PBC. The 2% interest rate that originally applied to both the GCL and PBC also increased to 2.7% as part of the rescheduling. The GCL rescheduling is captured via Project ID#95483. The PBC rescheduling is captured via Project ID#95484.  The Bui Dam Construction Project had six components: (1) a roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) gravity dam incorporating a 5-bay spillway; (2) three penstocks in the middle of the dam; (3) a powerhouse at the toe of the dam on the left bank; (4) two rock fill saddle dams on the right bank; (5) a switchyard; and (6) 276 km of transmission lines; and a permanent bridge downstream of the dam.   Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by Bui Power Authority. The dam was designed by the French engineering firm Coyne et Bellier, which also served as the consulting engineers on the project. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on August 24, 2007. However, construction did not begin until December 2, 2008. Then, on May 3, 2013, the first generator was inaugurated. The dam was inaugurated on December 19, 2013. However, the project was not completed and handed over to the Ghanaian authorities until November 28, 2016.   There are many indications that the China Eximbank loans for the Bui Dam Construction Project have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. First, in August 2017, the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod) — a state-owned company whose export receipts provide an important source of revenue for loan repayment to China Eximbank — told the country’s parliament it was in financial distress due to its loan repayment obligations related to the construction of the Bui Dam. Second, at least two of the four loans were rescheduled. Third, in April 2023, Samuel Kofi Dzamesi, the Chief Executive Officer of BPA revealed that the ECG had accumulated $612 million of payment arrears (overdue payments) to BPA. ECG’s payments to BPA for electricity purchases were originally intended to be the main source of revenue for repaying China Eximbank. Fourth, according to the World Bank’s International Development Statistics, the Government of Ghana had accumulated principal and interest arrears to one or more official sector Chinese creditors worth $908,337,346.70) in 2020 ($763,228,526.60 in principal arrears and $145,108,820.10 in interest arrears). Fifth, on December 19, 2022, the Government of Ghana announced a sovereign default, suspending debt service on its Eurobonds, its commercial loans, and most of its bilateral loans.

1. The precise dates on which the GCL and PBC rescheduling agreements were signed are unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes that each loan was rescheduled on the calendar day when it was originally scheduled to enter its repayment period (September 3, 2015 for the GCL and April 30, 2017 for the PBC). This issue merits further investigation."

Ltd. for a 100 MW Solar PV Power Plant in Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park. China Eximbank provided two loans: (1) an RMB 100 million loan with a 2.65% interest rate and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#54285) and (2) a $49.06 million loan with a 5.0058% interest rate and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#53989). Bank of Jiangsu Co. Ltd. provided the third loan worth $64.440 million with a 5.0958% interest rate and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#54286).   The borrower purchased credit insurance from Sinosure for both of these loans. The borrower, BGEPL, was expected to use the loan proceeds to partially finance two commercial (EPC) contracts that it signed on June 27, 2015: an offshore supply contract that it signed with China First Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd. and an onshore construction contract that it signed with MCC Ruba International Construction Company (Pvt) Ltd. The $150.269 million project was implemented on a build, own and operate (BOO) basis and financed according to a debt-equity ratio of 81:19. BGEPL achieved financial close on December 28, 2015, which is typically the date of the first loan disbursement.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 100 MW Solar PV Power Plant located in Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park at Lal Sohanra in Cholistan, within Bahawalpur District in the Province of Punjab. China First Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd and MCC Ruba International Construction Company (Pvt) Ltd were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. The project reached its commercial operations date (COD) on July 31, 2016.   However, this project has encountered debt repayment and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. In May 2022, reports emerged that the Government of Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to Zonergy and its subsidiaries/SPVs. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 10.4 billion (approximately $52 million). Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this “[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan.

[CPEC, IPP] Bank of Jiangsu provides $64.44 million loan for 100 MW Solar PV Power Plant in Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park (Linked to Project ID #50939, #54285, #53989)

# Description
On December 21, 2015, Best Green Energy Pakistan Limited (BGEPL) — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and wholly-owned subsidiary of Zonergy, which is itself a subsidiary of ZTE Corporation — signed three loan agreements with China Eximbank and Bank of Jiangsu Co. Ltd. for a 100 MW Solar PV Power Plant in Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park. China Eximbank provided two loans: (1) an RMB 100 million loan with a 2.65% interest rate and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#54285) and (2) a $49.06 million loan with a 5.0058% interest rate and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#53989). Bank of Jiangsu Co. Ltd. provided the third loan worth $64.440 million with a 5.0958% interest rate and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#54286).   The borrower purchased credit insurance from Sinosure for both of these loans. The borrower, BGEPL, was expected to use the loan proceeds to partially finance two commercial (EPC) contracts that it signed on June 27, 2015: an offshore supply contract that it signed with China First Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd. and an onshore construction contract that it signed with MCC Ruba International Construction Company (Pvt) Ltd. The $150.269 million project was implemented on a build, own and operate (BOO) basis and financed according to a debt-equity ratio of 81:19. BGEPL achieved financial close on December 28, 2015, which is typically the date of the first loan disbursement.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 100 MW Solar PV Power Plant located in Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park at Lal Sohanra in Cholistan, within Bahawalpur District in the Province of Punjab. China First Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd and MCC Ruba International Construction Company (Pvt) Ltd were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. The project reached its commercial operations date (COD) on July 31, 2016.   However, this project has encountered debt repayment and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. In May 2022, reports emerged that the Government of Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to Zonergy and its subsidiaries/SPVs. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 10.4 billion (approximately $52 million).

The financing organization's contribution ($2187500) was derived from dividing the full loan amount ($175 million) by the total amount of lenders (8).2. The loan's interest rate (4.458%) was derived from the sum of contemporary 3-month LIBOR (1.308%) and the margin rate (3.15%)."
60747,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides RMB 810 million government concessional loan for Port Gentil-Omboué Road and Bridge Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#73174),"On September 9, 2013, the Government of Gabon and China Eximbank signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 810 million (or approximately $121 million) for the Port Gentil-Omboue Road and Booué Bridge Construction Project. This loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. In 2013, the Government of Gabon and China Eximbank also signed a USD-denominated preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the Port Gentil-Omboué Road and Ogooué River Booué Bridge Construction Project.  The face value of the PBC was approximately 254.4 billion CFA francs, or approximately $534,582,600. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. The proceeds from the GCL and the PBC were used to finance a $663 million EPC contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC). Approximately 95% of the cost of this project was financed by China Eximbank while the remaining 5% was financed by the Government of Gabon itself.  The GCL that supported this project is captured in Project ID#60747. The PBC that supported this project is captured in Project ID#73174.   The project involved the construction of a 93.26 km two-way, two-lane highway from Port Gentil to Omboué (with an asphalt concrete surface, a subgrade width of 12 meters, and a subgrade width of 10 meters), the construction of three bridges (the 4707 meter Ogooué River Bridge, the 367 meter Booué Bridge, and the 4577 meter Nkomi Laguna Bridge) measuring 13 km in length, and the construction of 141 culverts.   CRBC was the contractor responsible for project implementation. It received an order to commence construction on March 20, 2014. Then, a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 3, 2014. The project was handed over on December 23, 2020.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loans for the Port Gentil-Omboue Road and Bridge Construction Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In mid-2014, a decline in international oil prices generated sharp reductions in Gabon’s oil exports and fiscal revenues. The country’s rising fiscal deficit led to the accumulation of arrears to external creditors. By 2017, the stock of the Government of Gabon’s external arrears stood at $115 million, including arrears to China, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Israel, and South Korea. All of these arrears were successfully cleared by 2020. However, the Government of Gabon accumulated $3 million of additional arrears to Chinese creditors in 2020.  By the end of May 2021, ‘the stock of [the Government of] Gabon’s external arrears stood at CFAF 98.03 billion (US$182.1 million), including CFAF 23.8 billion (US$44.2 million) vis-à-vis multilaterals and CFAF 21.05 billion (US$39.1 million) vis-à-vis government agencies and private creditors insured with companies from Paris Club member countries and from China [ICBC and China Construction Bank] CFAF 1.3 billion (US$2.42 million). The Government's strategy for the clearance of existing external arrears consists of focusing primarily on multilateral debt, bilateral debt, insured commercial commitments and seeking agreements with other creditors prior to the IMF Board meeting. Accordingly, we will clear the arrears vis-à-vis the multilaterals. We will also clear bilateral and commercial-insured arrears as follows: (i) Austria CFAF 6.83 billion (US$12.69 million); (ii) France CFAF 11.9 billion (US$22.11 million); (iii) Israel CFAF 2.23 billion (US$4.13 million); and Spain CFAF 0.09 billion (US$0.17 million).

The same communication was made with China to which our bilateral payment arrears are about CFAF 34.01 billion (US$63.17 million).’ Then, in 2022, the IMF reported that the Government of Gabon’s external arrears to Chinese creditors stood at $23.9 million as of December 2021 and $1 million in June 2022.","1.

30926,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides $482.8 million preferential buyer credit for Phase 1 of Yaounde-Douala Highway Project,"On March 8, 2012, China Eximbank and Cameroon's Ministry of Economy, Planning, and Regional Development (MINEPAT) signed a $482,800,000 preferential buyer credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2012) 10TOTAL NO.(198) 1420303052012210261] for Phase 1 of the Yaounde-Douala Highway Project.  The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.30% commitment fee, and a 0.30% management fee. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan (PBC) to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $568,000,000 commercial (EPC) contract between Cameroon’s Ministry of Public Works of the Republic of Cameroon and China First Highway Engineering Co. Ltd. (CFHEC), which was signed on August 8, 2011.   As of December 31, 2020, the loan had achieved a 73.2% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 69.4 billion). The loan’s amount outstanding was equivalent to CFA 188.1 billion as of December 31, 2020.   The purpose of the Yaounde-Douala highway project is to facilitate the construction of a 215 km road linking Douala on the western coast with capital Yaounde. Phase 1 will involve construction of a 68.3 km long road, which will run from Yaoundé to Bot Makak/Bibodi. The six-lane highway will be the first new motorway since the country's independence. The project seeks to replace the existing hazardous two-lane highway, and it aims to boost domestic and sub-regional trade as well as shorten the distance between Douala and Yaounde from 265 km to 215 km.   CFHEC was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Phase 1 construction activities began on April 15, 2014, and the originally expected project completion date was October 13, 2018; however, by April 29, 2014, there was reportedly a protracted conflict between China First Highway Engineering Co. Ltd. (CFHEC) and the Control Mission led by the SCET-Tunisie/Louis Berger. Project implementation was delayed by unpaid indemnity owed to those living along the first 10 km of highway. The Cameroonian authorities also reportedly made modifications to the specifications of the project by increasing the speed limit from 100 km/hour to 110 km/hour and adding extra lanes, leading the EPC contractor to assert that according to the budget only 47 km of the road could be constructed under such conditions. By January 2015, construction had recommenced, as reported by the China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) who noted that tree felling had taken place along 40 km of the road’s route and that earthworks had started not long before. Then, in 2017, delays in payment to the contractor led to a one month suspension of construction beginning on May 2, 2017 and concluding in June 2017 after settlements were paid.  As of May 2019, Phase 1 had achieved a 74% completion rate. As of February 2020, the project had achieved a 80% completion rate and 6 of 36 engineering structures were not yet finished. In April 2020, the company in charge of supervising the works, SCET-TUNISIE, reported that the project was scheduled to reach completion by December 2020 in spite of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of August 2021, the project had achieved a 98% completion rate.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the Yaounde-Douala Highway Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.’",1.

Phase 1 will involve construction of a 68.3 km long road, which will run from Yaoundé to Bot Makak/Bibodi. The six-lane highway will be the first new motorway since the country's independence. The project seeks to replace the existing hazardous two-lane highway, and it aims to boost domestic and sub-regional trade as well as shorten the distance between Douala and Yaounde from 265 km to 215 km.   CFHEC was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Phase 1 construction activities began on April 15, 2014, and the originally expected project completion date was October 13, 2018; however, by April 29, 2014, there was reportedly a protracted conflict between China First Highway Engineering Co. Ltd. (CFHEC) and the Control Mission led by the SCET-Tunisie/Louis Berger. Project implementation was delayed by unpaid indemnity owed to those living along the first 10 km of highway. The Cameroonian authorities also reportedly made modifications to the specifications of the project by increasing the speed limit from 100 km/hour to 110 km/hour and adding extra lanes, leading the EPC contractor to assert that according to the budget only 47 km of the road could be constructed under such conditions. By January 2015, construction had recommenced, as reported by the China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) who noted that tree felling had taken place along 40 km of the road’s route and that earthworks had started not long before. Then, in 2017, delays in payment to the contractor led to a one month suspension of construction beginning on May 2, 2017 and concluding in June 2017 after settlements were paid.  As of May 2019, Phase 1 had achieved a 74% completion rate. As of February 2020, the project had achieved a 80% completion rate and 6 of 36 engineering structures were not yet finished. In April 2020, the company in charge of supervising the works, SCET-TUNISIE, reported that the project was scheduled to reach completion by December 2020 in spite of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of August 2021, the project had achieved a 98% completion rate.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the Yaounde-Douala Highway Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.’

According to a letter issued by Ethiopia’s Office of the Prime Minister on June 5, 2019, Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed lifted restrictions imposed by the National Bank of Ethiopia compelling international oil and gas companies to hold a local foreign currency account. The condition was the major hurdle that restricted the country from getting foreign direct investments in the oil and mining sector, according to Samuel Urkato (PhD), minister of Mines & Petroleum. 'Many companies that want to invest in the country have backed off due to this restraint,' Samuel told Fortune. The new decision was passed after having a serious debate with the officials of the National Bank of Ethiopia,” Samuel said. The companies were also frustrated by the directive, which limited them from obtaining loans from international creditors. “Since international creditors require the forex account of borrowers as a requirement for loan approval, the companies, especially Poly-GCL, have been continuously calling for the reversal of the directive,' said Samuel. Poly GCL, which discovered crude oil reserves in three wells in the Hilala region and launched test production in June 2018, has been filing complaint letters with the government for the past two years. The companies have been transferring foreign currency into their local accounts to finance their oil and gas exploration activities and withdrawing cash in local currency for their expenditures.","# Sector

The meeting was chaired by WANG Lin, chairman of GCL Natural Gas Group, and attended by all senior management of the company. On June 2, 2020, ZHANG Lei, Deputy General Manager of Zhuhai Cold Energy Utilization Company of CNOOC Energy Development Co., Ltd led a team to visit the Beijing office of Poly-GCL Petroleum Group to exchange views with ZHOU Gan, CEO of Poly-GCL Petroleum Group, on cooperation in cold energy utilization. On the morning of June 4, 2020 (Ethiopian time), Poly-GCL Petroleum Investments Co., Ltd. and Ethiopia Minerals, Petroleum and Biofuels Corporation, Ethiopian Ministry of Mines Representative company, signed the Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. On July 16, 2020, an external panel review of GCL Natural Gas Group's Ethiopia-Djibouti natural gas project development plan was held in the Beijing office. The next day, on July 17, 2020, representatives of Beijing Guolian Energy Industrial Investment Fund and the China Agricultural Reclamation Industry Development Fund visited the Suzhou GCL Energy Center, where ZHU Gongshan, Chairman of GCL Group, met with visiting delegation. On the morning of August 20, 2020 (Ethiopia time), the first meeting of the Ministerial Steering Committee on the Ethiopian Natural Gas Project was held at the Ministry of Finance of Ethiopia. The meeting was chaired by Finance Minister Ahmed Shide, and Poly-GCL Petroleum Group Chairman Barton Yu participated through video connection. On September 14, 2020, WANG Yuanhong, Deputy Manager of the Oilfield Technical Services Branch of Xinjiang Oilfield Company, and WANG Yang, Vice President of kramay Zhongshida Joint Oil and Gas Science and Technology Research Institute, led a team of leading experts to visit the Beijing office of Poly-GCL Petroleum Group.   As of September 2021, there was no evidence that construction had begun on the pipeline. This implementation delay was reportedly related to political and security risks to the oil and gas sector in the region. POLY-GCL Petroleum Group Holdings Limited is expecting to generate $1 billion of revenue in gas exports during the pipeline’s first operational year, due to the discovery of 7 to 8 billion cubic trillion feet (TFC) of natural gas in Ethiopia's Somali regional state. The Ethiopian Government expects that production will commence in 2023.

According to a letter issued by Ethiopia’s Office of the Prime Minister on June 5, 2019, Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed lifted restrictions imposed by the National Bank of Ethiopia compelling international oil and gas companies to hold a local foreign currency account. The condition was the major hurdle that restricted the country from getting foreign direct investments in the oil and mining sector, according to Samuel Urkato (PhD), minister of Mines & Petroleum. 'Many companies that want to invest in the country have backed off due to this restraint,' Samuel told Fortune. The new decision was passed after having a serious debate with the officials of the National Bank of Ethiopia,” Samuel said. The companies were also frustrated by the directive, which limited them from obtaining loans from international creditors. “Since international creditors require the forex account of borrowers as a requirement for loan approval, the companies, especially Poly-GCL, have been continuously calling for the reversal of the directive,' said Samuel. Poly GCL, which discovered crude oil reserves in three wells in the Hilala region and launched test production in June 2018, has been filing complaint letters with the government for the past two years. The companies have been transferring foreign currency into their local accounts to finance their oil and gas exploration activities and withdrawing cash in local currency for their expenditures."

The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. Then, in 2017, ICBC and the Government of Zambia signed a $59.58 million loan agreement for the Ndola International Airport Construction Project (captured via Project ID#57092). The borrowing terms of the ICBC loan are unknown. The proceeds of the China Eximbank PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $397,201,694 commercial (EPC) contract between Zambia Airports Corporation Limited (ZACL) and AVIC International Holding Corporation, which was signed on September 11, 2013 and amended on August 25, 2014. The proceeds of the ICBC loan were to be used by the borrower to finance 15% of the cost of the $397,201,694 commercial (EPC) contract between Zambia Airports Corporation Limited (ZACL) and AVIC International Holding Corporation. As of July 2022, the China Eximbank loan had achieved a 57.1% disbursement rate ($192,785,140.88 out of $337,621,439.90).   The project involved the construction of a 12,000 square meter terminal building, 3 aero bridges, a 3.5 kilometer runway, a cargo terminal, a 50-room hotel, a new fire and rescue station, a cargo terminal, an aircraft maintenance hangar, and a fuel farm. AVIC International Holding Corporation was the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. It reportedly fulfilled the government policy of having 20 percent sub-contracting to local contractors by engaging 60 local sub-contractors. 2,700 people were employed during the project construction period.   A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on June 25, 2017. However, the construction site was not handed over to the EPC contractor until September 28, 2017. The EPC contract went into effect and construction began on October 26, 2017. By December 17, 2019, the overall project had achieved a 58% completion rate; the passenger terminal completion rate was 61%, the business complex completion rate was 49%, the air traffic control building completion rate was 54%, the runway, taxiway and apron completion rate was 98%, and the viaduct completion rate was 80%. As of March 2020, the project had achieved an overall completion rate of 60%. As of April 2021, the project had achieved an overall completion rate of 88.9%. The project was originally expected to reach completion on October 20, 2020. However, due to implementation delays related to financing problems and the COVID-19 pandemic, the intended project completion date was pushed out to January 31, 2022. The airport was officially commissioned on August 5, 2021, but the airport was still reportedly waiting for operational certifications at that time. This project has also been plagued by financial problems due to overdue contractor payments. According to Clause 43.1 of the commercial contract between AVIC International Holding Corporation and ZACL, if the client (ZACL) failed to make payment within a stipulated period of time, the EPC contractor (AVIC International Holding Corporation) was entitled to the payment of interest for the late payment, which was to be calculated from the date by which the payment should have been made until the date on which payment was made by applying the interest rate as per local practice. If the payment was delayed for more than 56 days, the EPC contractor would have the right to suspend the works or terminate the commercial contract. Contrary to the clause, AVIC International Holding Corporation had not been paid a total of $97,324,668 being outstanding interim payment certificates (IPCs) for a period of more than fourteen months. In addition, there was no documentation availed to the Auditor General of Zambia to indicate why, despite the financing agreement being in force, the lender had not paid the contractor.   On April 5, 2021, AVIC International Holding Corporation claimed interest on late payments on outstanding IPCs in amounts totaling $1,913,155. AVIC International Senior Consultant, Lei Yingqi, later confirmed that AVIC International Holding Corporation as an EPC contractor was using borrowed funds at high interest rates to ensure that the project continued to progress and the employees continued to be paid. He also indicated that ‘support from abroad was cut off or delayed’, which suggests that the source of the borrowed funds was not China Eximbank or ICBC. Then, on July 29, 2022, the Ministry of Finance & National Planning (MOFNP) of Zambia announced that it was seeking lender approval to formally cancel the China Eximbank loan’s undisbursed balance ($144,836,299.02); however, it also noted that it had not yet secured formal lender approval for this action. This announcement came approximately 21 months after the Government of Zambia defaulted on its repayment obligations to Eurobond holders and approximately 6 weeks after China, France, and 14 other countries formed a creditor committee to discuss the Zambian authorities’ request for a debt treatment under ‘the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the DSSI’ endorsed by the G20 and the Paris Club. MOFNP also announced on July 29, 2022 that it planned to finance the completion of the Ndola International Airport Construction Project with general government revenues, and it signaled its intention to rescope the project to focus on the ‘selected works’ (i.e. access road and completion of the fuel farm).","1.

In late 2021, Ndola's airport was officially moved from Itawa to a new address, 15 kilometers west of the city centre, just north of the Dag Hammarskjöld Crash Site Memorial, which is its current address. The airport's current location, while under construction, was known as the Copperbelt International Airport until late 2021, when it became the official airport of Ndola. As such, the name for Ndola's Airport (Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe International Airport) became the name for the newly built airport.

Then, in November 2012, an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (EIA) was issued for the project. A Letter of Support (LOS) for the project was issued by PPIB on June 30, 2016. Then, on December 14, 2016, a bidding consortium (joint venture) consisting of China Gezhouba Group Company Limited and China Gezhouba Group International Engineering Co. Ltd was identified as providing the most advantageous bid for the Azad Pattan Hydropower Plant Construction Project. An award was made to this bidding consortium on December 27, 2016. Approximately six months later, on June 11, 2017, the Government of Pakistan, China Gezhouba Group Company Limited, and China Gezhouba Group International Engineering Co. Ltd signed a commercial (EPC) contract for the Azad Pattan Hydropower Plant Construction Project. The EPC contract was structured as an onshore civil works contract and an offshore supply contract covering imported M&E plant and equipment for permanent installation in the power generating complex. It included provisions for adjusting the contract price for changes in costs for cement, fuel, steel reinforcement and labour due to variation in applicable prices/indices published by Pakistan Bureau of Statistics from the specified base date (November 2016) through construction to commercial operations date (COD).  On June 23, 2017, Azad Pattan Power (Private) Limited — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of China Gezhouba Group Company Limited (80% ownership stake) and Laraib Group (20%) ownership stake — submitted a tariff proposal to the Government of Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) for the Azad Pattan Hydropower Plant Construction Project. At that time, the estimated cost of the project was $1,516,170,000 and it was expected to be financed according to a 75:25 debt:equity ratio. China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd. (CGGC) agreed to partially finance the equity portion equal to $379.04 million (as captured via Project ID#54233). At the time that the tariff proposal was submitted to NEPRA, Azad Pattan Power (Private) Limited expected that a consortium of Chinese state-owned banks — consisting of China Development Bank (CDB), China Construction Bank (CCB), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and Bank of China (BOC) — would provide a $1,137,130,000 syndicated overseas investment loan in support of the project. The proposed borrowing terms included an 18-year maturity, a 6-year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.3% to 4.2%, a 0.8% commitment fee, and a 1% management fee. Repayments would be made in 24 equal semi-annual installments (over 12 years). Sinosure was also expected to provide overseas investment loan insurance for this project. Then, on November 10, 2017, a grid interconnection study for the project was approved by NTDC. A Panel of Experts (POE) constituted by PPIB approved an optimized design of the project with installed capacity of 700.7 MW on December 6, 2017. The project secured approvals from the relevant Environmental Protection Agencies (EPAs) in March 2018. The EPC stage tariff was determined by NEPRA on May 17, 2018 and amended through a review determination on October 11, 2018. On July 6, 2020, China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd. (CGGC) and the Government of Pakistan signed 30-year concession (‘project implementation’) agreement and agreed to implement the project on a Build, Own, Operate, Transfer (BOOT) basis. At the end of a 30-year concession period, the project owner (Azad Pattan Power Private Limited) will handed over the power plant to the Government of Pakistan.

# Description
On January 24, 2012, a Panel of Experts (PoE) constituted by the Government of Pakistan’s Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) approved a Feasibility Study for the Azad Pattan Hydropower Plant Construction Project. Then, in November 2012, an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (EIA) was issued for the project. A Letter of Support (LOS) for the project was issued by PPIB on June 30, 2016. Then, on December 14, 2016, a bidding consortium (joint venture) consisting of China Gezhouba Group Company Limited and China Gezhouba Group International Engineering Co. Ltd was identified as providing the most advantageous bid for the Azad Pattan Hydropower Plant Construction Project. An award was made to this bidding consortium on December 27, 2016. Approximately six months later, on June 11, 2017, the Government of Pakistan, China Gezhouba Group Company Limited, and China Gezhouba Group International Engineering Co. Ltd signed a commercial (EPC) contract for the Azad Pattan Hydropower Plant Construction Project. The EPC contract was structured as an onshore civil works contract and an offshore supply contract covering imported M&E plant and equipment for permanent installation in the power generating complex. It included provisions for adjusting the contract price for changes in costs for cement, fuel, steel reinforcement and labour due to variation in applicable prices/indices published by Pakistan Bureau of Statistics from the specified base date (November 2016) through construction to commercial operations date (COD).  On June 23, 2017, Azad Pattan Power (Private) Limited — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of China Gezhouba Group Company Limited (80% ownership stake) and Laraib Group (20%) ownership stake — submitted a tariff proposal to the Government of Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) for the Azad Pattan Hydropower Plant Construction Project. At that time, the estimated cost of the project was $1,516,170,000 and it was expected to be financed according to a 75:25 debt:equity ratio. China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd. (CGGC) agreed to partially finance the equity portion equal to $379.04 million (as captured via Project ID#54233). At the time that the tariff proposal was submitted to NEPRA, Azad Pattan Power (Private) Limited expected that a consortium of Chinese state-owned banks — consisting of China Development Bank (CDB), China Construction Bank (CCB), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and Bank of China (BOC) — would provide a $1,137,130,000 syndicated overseas investment loan in support of the project. The proposed borrowing terms included an 18-year maturity, a 6-year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.3% to 4.2%, a 0.8% commitment fee, and a 1% management fee. Repayments would be made in 24 equal semi-annual installments (over 12 years). Sinosure was also expected to provide overseas investment loan insurance for this project. Then, on November 10, 2017, a grid interconnection study for the project was approved by NTDC. A Panel of Experts (POE) constituted by PPIB approved an optimized design of the project with installed capacity of 700.7 MW on December 6, 2017. The project secured approvals from the relevant Environmental Protection Agencies (EPAs) in March 2018. The EPC stage tariff was determined by NEPRA on May 17, 2018 and amended through a review determination on October 11, 2018. On July 6, 2020, China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd. (CGGC) and the Government of Pakistan signed 30-year concession (‘project implementation’) agreement and agreed to implement the project on a Build, Own, Operate, Transfer (BOOT) basis. At the end of a 30-year concession period, the project owner (Azad Pattan Power Private Limited) will handed over the power plant to the Government of Pakistan. Azad Pattan Power Private Limited also signed a Water Use Agreement with the Government of Punjab and a Tripartite Power Purchase Agreement on July 6, 2020. Then, on December 1, 2020, Azad Pattan Power (Private) Limited and Government of Azad Jammu & Kashmir signed the GoAJ&K Implementation Agreement (GoAJ&K IA) and GoAJ&K Water Use Agreement (GoAJ&K WUA). A Term Sheet defining key terms and conditions agreed between Azad Pattan Power (Private) Limited (borrower) and the consortium of Chinese state-owned banks was executed on January 5, 2021.

# Title
China Eximbank provides $51.8 million preferential buyer’s credit for Phase 2 of Orsha Linen Mill Modernization Project

# Description
On December 30, 2015, China Eximbank and the Government of Belarus signed a $51,834,700 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK № PBC (2015) 44 (387)] for Phase 2 of the Orsha Linen Mill Modernization Project. The PBC carries a maturity of 15 years. Its interest rate and grace period are unknown. BSP-Sberbank OJSC is the loan servicing agent. The proceeds of the PBC were on-lent from the Government of Belarus to a state-owned company called RUPTP Orsha Linen Mill (РУПТП Оршанский льнокомбинат), which in turn used the proceeds to finance 85% of the cost ($60.982 million) of its commercial (EPC) contract with CITIC Construction, which was signed on May 11, 2015.   The purpose of this project was to upgrade and reconstruct the Orsha Linen Mill (Orša Flax Mill), which is a textile enterprise in the city of Orsha that processes linen fiber and produces linen fabrics. Upon completion of the project, it was envisaged that the processing capacity of the factory would increase by 80%. Labor costs were also expected to fall by 45% and value-added per worker was expected to rise to $15,100 per year.   CITIC Construction was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. This project was implemented between 2015 and 2017. On December 11, 2017, the Vitebsk State Construction Supervision Bureau of the National Standards Committee of Belarus formally issued a project acceptance certificate, which marked the successful completion of the project.

67091,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",China Eximbank and CDB provide EUR 2.5 billion of debt financing for Arctic LNG 2 Project (Linked to Project ID#89463),"On November 1, 2017, China Development Bank signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Novatek regarding the Arctic LNG 2 Project.  A special purpose vehicle (SPV) and project company — called Arctic LNG 2 LLC — has been established to finance, design, implement, and operate this project. In September 2020, a group of lenders — including France’s Bpifrance, Germany’s Euler Hermes, Italy’s SACE, Russia’s Sberbank, China Development Bank (CDB), and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) — expressed interest in financing the Arctic LNG 2 project. At the time, CDB was expected to offer a $5 billion loan in support of the $21 billion project.    Then, on April 28, 2021, Arctic LNG 2 LLC — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of NOVATEK (60%), Total (10%), CNPC (10%), CNOOC (10%) and the Japan Arctic LNG, consortium of Mitsui & Co, Ltd. and JOGMEC (10%) — announced the signing of an EUR 3.11 billion loan agreement with a syndicate of Russian banks, including PJSC Sberbank, Gazprombank (Joint Stock Company) and its subsidiary Bank GPB International S.A., State Development Corporation VEB.RF and «Bank Otkritie Financial Corporation» (Public Joint-Stock Company). This loan carries a 15-year maturity and it is apparently collateralized against NOVATEK’s 60% equity stake in Arctic LNG-2 LLC. As of September 30, 2021, about 52% of the total planned capital expenditures of Arctic LNG 2 Project had been financed. Then, on November 30, 2021, Arctic LNG 2 LLC announced the signing of loan agreements with a group international financial institutions and commercial banks. The maximum aggregate borrowing amount under the loan facilities to be provided by the Russian and international banks is EUR 9.5 billion for up to 15 years. These credit facility agreements including buyer’s credit facility agreements with China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China worth EUR 2.5 billion. The borrower also purchased buyer’s credit insurance from Sinosure. Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) also issued a loan to Arctic LNG 2.   The loan proceeds are to be used by the borrower to finance an EPC contract with TechnipFMC, which was signed in July 2019.  The purpose of the project is to create a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility consisting of three trains, each using concrete gravity-based structures. The LNG facility will be located in the Gydan Peninsula in Siberia. Upon completion, its expected annual LNG production capacity is 19.8 million metric tons per year. TechnipFMC — a joint venture of Technip Energies, Saipem and NIPIGAS — is the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Wison Offshore and Marine Ltd is a subcontractor involved in the project; its scope of work is engineering, procurement, fabrication, and commissioning of modules in train one with a total weight of 48,000 MT. The project’s front-end engineering design (FEED) was completed in October 2018. A final investment decision (FID) made in September 2019.   On June 17, 2021, the first plane landed at the Utrenniy airport built specifically for the Arctic LNG 2 project on the Gydan Peninsula in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region.  Shanghai-based Wison Offshore and Marine Ltd, a subsidiary of privately owned Chinese conglomerate Wison Group, shipped the first two of four giant industrial modules for the Arctic LNG 2 project of Novatek, the largest independent natural gas producer of Russia, on August 26, 2021. The modules dispatched from Zhoushan shipyard were slated to arrive in Russia's Arctic port city of Murmansk after 25 days. On September 21, 2021. Arctic LNG 2 LLC announced that the first modules for LNG Train 1 were successfully delivered. The two first pipe-rack modules weighing approximately nine thousand tons each were shipped from the Zhoushan port in China to the NOVATEK-Murmansk LNG Construction Center and were to be further skidded onto the Gravity Base Structure, or GBS, platform of LNG Train 1. The next two modules were loaded onto a transport ship and put in transit to Murmansk. Overall, 14 modules are schedule to be delivered from contractors' shipyards for the first LNG train. By the end of the third quarter 2021, the project had achieved a 52% completion rate and the first train was roughly 69% complete.   However, the project encountered significant implementation obstacles and delays in 2022. Technip Energies warned in April 2022 that international sanctions (resulting from Russia's military invasion of Ukraine), would complicate the completion of the project. Technip’s CEO Arnaud Pieton said at the time that '[t]he European sanctions now target LNG goods and technology and services more directly, I would say, making the execution of [Arctic LNG 2] more complicated, maybe even highly complicated.' Then, work on train three was halted on on April 29, 2022 and work on train two was halted on May 27, 2022. All foreign workers were to leave their work sites by the end of May 2022, which placed the borrowing institution (Arctic LNG 2 LLC) and its contractors in a race against time to procure essential equipment and technology before deliveries to Russia became much harder or impossible. However, in January 2023, Novatek ordered Chinese yards to restart work on LNG modules destined for the Arctic LNG 2 Project, after an eight-month hiatus in activities related European sanctions on Russia.   There are also indications that the Arctic LNG 2 Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of its lenders. In February 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued Directive 3 Under Executive Order 14024, which prohibited U.S. persons from engaging in all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of greater than 14 days maturity and new equity issued by 13 Russian state-owned enterprises and entities, as well as their subsidiaries, on or after March 26, 2022. The entities included Transneft, Sberbank, AlfaBank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Rostelecom, RusHydro, Alrosa, Sovcomflot, and Russian Railways. Then, on March 5, 2022, the Russian Government issued Presidential Decree No. 95, which required that Russian borrowers make payments to foreign creditors from ‘unfriendly states’—including most countries that imposed sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine—in Russian rubles (irrespective of the currency of the loan), unless a permission to make direct payments in the contractual currency was granted by either the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) or Russia’s Ministry of Finance. This measure made it substantially more difficult for Russian borrowers to make timely payments on foreign- and local-currency debt to certain international creditors in their original currencies of denomination.  Then, in June 2022, the Russian Government defaulted on some of its dollar-denominated and euro-denominated debt.  Two months earlier, in April 2022, France’s Total, announced a $4.1 billion impairment and Japan's Mitsui & Co, Ltd. decided to take a write-off related to its 10 percent equity stake in the Arctic LNG 2 Project. Mitsui & Co, Ltd. reported that it had recorded a loss of $162 million related to its investment in project as a result of higher loan and guarantee obligations stemming from a worsening Russian credit rating. The fact that at least two of Arctic LNG 2 LLC's lenders (Sberbank and Gazprombank) faced international sanctions in 2022 and 2023 also complicated the implementation of the project.","1.

Then, on March 5, 2022, the Russian Government issued Presidential Decree No. 95, which required that Russian borrowers make payments to foreign creditors from ‘unfriendly states’—including most countries that imposed sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine—in Russian rubles (irrespective of the currency of the loan), unless a permission to make direct payments in the contractual currency was granted by either the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) or Russia’s Ministry of Finance. This measure made it substantially more difficult for Russian borrowers to make timely payments on foreign- and local-currency debt to certain international creditors in their original currencies of denomination.  Then, in June 2022, the Russian Government defaulted on some of its dollar-denominated and euro-denominated debt.  Two months earlier, in April 2022, France’s Total, announced a $4.1 billion impairment and Japan's Mitsui & Co, Ltd. decided to take a write-off related to its 10 percent equity stake in the Arctic LNG 2 Project. Mitsui & Co, Ltd. reported that it had recorded a loss of $162 million related to its investment in project as a result of higher loan and guarantee obligations stemming from a worsening Russian credit rating. The fact that at least two of Arctic LNG 2 LLC's lenders (Sberbank and Gazprombank) faced international sanctions in 2022 and 2023 also complicated the implementation of the project.

The generators were successfully handed over to the Comorian authorities on August 5, 2010. The Chinese Government asked the Government of Comoros to pay for the cost of installing these generators, but they were unable to do so, which led to major delays in generator installation and use. China’s Ministry of Commerce subsequently agreed to provide a grant worth 200 million Comorian francs for the installation of the generators (through the so-called 'Electricity Generator Installation Project').

A contract with China Shenyang International Economic & Technical Cooperation corporation (CSYIC) was signed on September 29, 2012 to facilitate the implementation of the China Shenyang International Economic & Technical Cooperation Corporation (CSYIC). These generators were all successfully installed; however, the power plants where they were installed did not go into use until several years later. The Voidjou (Vwadju) power plant, Trenani power plant, and Wemani power plant were officially inaugurated on February 5, 2017, April 20, 2017, and May 4, 2017, respectively.   Then, in 2014, China’s Ministry of Commerce issued an RMB 29.25 million grant for the Phase 1 of Power Plant Technical Cooperation Project. The purpose of this project was to dispatch 6 engineers to maintain and operate Voidjou (Vwadju) power plant on the island of Ngazidja (Grande Comore), the the Wemani power plant in city of Fomboni on the island of Mohéli (Mwali); and the Trenani power plant on the island of Ndzuani (Anjouan). CSYIC was the contractor responsible for implementation and it completed this project between 2014 and 2016.   Then on January 8, 2016 and January 14, 2016 the Chinese Government and the Government of Comoros signed letters of exchange for Phase 2 of Power Plant Technical Cooperation Project. China’s Ministry of Commerce issued an RMB 28,970,103.80 grant for Phase 2. The purpose of Phase 2 was to dispatch technicians and engineers over a 3-year period to maintain and operate Voidjou (Vwadju) power plant on the island of Ngazidja (Grande Comore), the the Wemani power plant in city of Fomboni on the island of Mohéli (Mwali); and the Trenani power plant on the island of Ndzuani (Anjouan).    Phase 2 also involved the provision of spare parts and equipment needed for repairs. CSYIC was the contractor responsible for implementation. One official source from 2018 indicates that Phase 2 was ongoing. However, precise Phase 2 implementation start end dates are unknown.    The Electricity Generator Acquisition Project is captured via Project ID#57255. The Electricity Generator Installation Project is captured via Project ID#57251. Phase 1 of Power Plant Technical Cooperation Project is captured via Project ID#73535.  Phase 2 of Power Plant Technical Cooperation Project is captured via Project ID#57412.

The loan were issued by six local banks, including Turkish banks (Türkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Is Bankasi A.S., QNB Finansbank A.S., T.C. Ziraat Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. and Türkiye Vakiflar Bankasi T.A.O.). One loan will mature in December 2022 (with a fixed interest rate of 7.6%) and the other will mature in June 2024 (with a floating interest rate of LIBOR + 550 basis points).   Additionally, $600 million of equity financing was provided by Astaldi S.P.A and IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S.: $387.33 million IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S. and $193.67 million from Astaldi S.P.A. The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee, agreeing to repay the debt incurred by borrower/project company (IC Ictas-Astaldi) in the event that it defaulted on its repayment obligations. The Government of Turkey’s General Directorate of Highways (KGM) also provided a minimum traffic guarantee to the project company (to secure the payback of the debt and equity if the generated revenue was insufficient).   Then, in 2018, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's branch in Turkey (ICBC Turkey) was mandated by IC Ictas-Astaldi to lead and arrange syndication for the refinancing of $2.67 billion of debt used to construct the Third Bosphorus Bridge (or Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge) and North Marmara Motorway PPP Project. A letter of authorization for the refinancing was signed at the One Belt, One Road Investment and Financial Cooperation Summit in Ankara on July 26, 2018. Under the agreement, ICBC Turkey agreed in principle to facilitate the refinancing of the project, previously funded by the Turkish banking system, on more favorable terms.   Then, in September 2019, two syndicated loan agreements worth $4.435 billion were signed (with ICBC serving as the lead arranger) for the Kurtköy-Akyazı and Kınalı-Odayeri sections of the project: a $2,840,000,000 loan agreement was signed by KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. and a group of ten lenders (ICBC Turkey, Bank of China, Kuveyt Türk Katilim Bankasi A.S., Albaraka Türk Katılım Bankası A.Ş., Türkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Is Bankasi A.S., QNB Finansbank A.S., T.C. Ziraat Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. and Türkiye Vakiflar Bankasi T.A.O.) to refinance the $1.04 billion loan that was issued in September 2013 for the 171 km Kurtköy-Akyazı Section of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project and finance new/additional capex requirements as a result of changes in the project scope (that increased the total cost of the project’s 171 km Kurtköy-Akyazı Section to $3.646 billion); and a $1,595,000,000 loan was signed by KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. and a group of ten lenders (ICBC Turkey, Bank of China, Kuveyt Türk Katilim Bankasi A.S., Albaraka Türk Katılım Bankası A.Ş., Türkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Is Bankasi A.S., QNB Finansbank A.S., T.C. Ziraat Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. and Türkiye Vakiflar Bankasi T.A.O.) to refinance the $1.63 billion loan that was issued in September 2013 for the 90 km Kınalı-Odayeri Section of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project and finance new/additional capex requirements as a result of changes in the project scope (that increased the total cost of the project’s 90 km Kınalı-Odayeri Section to $2.077 billion). The two loans have two different maturity lengths, reflecting the different concession lengths of the two sponsors. The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee for both loans on September 16, 2019. The total amount that was reportedly provided (across both loans) by ICBC Turkey was $1 billion (as captured via Project ID#67325). Bank of China’s estimated contribution to both loans ($381,666,666) is captured via Project ID#67331.   Then, on December 2, 2021, ICBC and KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. signed a $1,198,302,550 loan agreement (captured via Project ID#96108) to refinance a $2,138,000,000 loan that was issued on May 13, 2014 signed in 2014 and a $420,000,000 loan that was issued on March 11, 2016 for the Odayeri-Paşaköy Section of the Northern Marmara Motorway (including Third Bosphorus Bridge) Project. The borrowing terms of the ICBC loan are unknown.  The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee for the $1,198,302,550 loan on December 2, 2021.  The purpose of the project was to construct a 1.408 kilometer long-span bridge to be used by road vehicles and trains to cross the Bosphorus Strait from Poyrazkoy in Asia to Garipce in Europe, as well as the construction of a section of the North Marmara Highway along the Odayeri-Pasakoy route. The bridge is 59 meters long and it stretches 1,408 meters over the Bosporus, linking the European and Asian sides of Istanbul. It has eight highway lanes (4 in each direction), divided by two high-speed rail corridors of 1,048 meters. The bridge is a critical part of the larger Northern Marmara Highway (Motorway) Project, linking to the Odayeri-Pasaköy route of the Motorway. The 261 km km Northern Marmara Highway was intended to increase economic efficiency in Turkey, allow for greater access to Istanbul Airport, provide alternate routes to going through Istanbul, and start on the western side of Istanbul and end in the eastern Marmara province of Sakarya. ICA IC İçtaş Astaldi Üçüncü Boğaz Köprüsü ve Kuzey Marmara Otoyolu Yatırım ve İşletme A.Ş. (IC Ictas-Astaldi) was responsible for project implementation. Construction began in September 2012 using the SPV's equity, and was originally expected to take 36 months. The Odayeri-Paşaköy section of the motorway was completed August 26, 2016. The Kurtköy-Akyazı section of the project was completed and opened to traffic on December 19, 2020.   On December 23, 2019, China Merchants Expressway Network & Technology Holdings Co. Ltd, China Merchants Union (BVI) Limited, Jiangsu Expressway Company Limited, Zhejiang Expressway Co. Ltd., Anhui Expressway Company Limited and Sichuan Expressway Co announced that it had entered an agreement and jointly set up a consortium company (“Consortium Company”) to acquire: (1) 51% equity stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi (the SPV responsible for the Third Bosphorus Bridge PPP Project); (2) 51% of a related shareholder loan of IC Ictas-Astaldi; and (3) 51% equity stake in Eurasia Motorway Maintenance and Operations Limited (“IC Maintenance”), a company engages in the operations and maintenance of projects operated by IC Ictas-Astaldi. Shareholders of the Consortium Company expected to invest up to $688.5 million. As a part of the acquisition, China Merchants, China Merchants United, Zhejiang Expressway, Jiangsu Expressway, Sichuan Expressway and Anhui Expressway held 31%, 20%, 17.5%, 17.5%, 7% and 7% equity stakes in the Consortium Company, respectively. Upon completion of the acquisition, the Zhejiang Expressway Co., Ltd. would indirectly hold an 8.925% equity stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi, 8.925% of the related shareholder loan of IC Ictas-Astaldi, and an 8.925% equity stake in IC Maintenance, respectively. However, the preliminary agreement that was signed on December 23, 2019 was interrupted due to the Covid-19 pandemic. ICBC, Bank of China, and China Merchants Bank subsequently indicated that they were willing to issue a $1.6 billion loan to the Consortium Company in 2021 to facilitate their acquisition of a 51% ownership stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi for $688.5 million. Their loan would mature in 2027, just before the project company’s concession expired. Sinosure would provide credit insurance. However, IJ Global reported in August 2021 that the Chinese companies in the Consortium Company requested to enter into negotiations to terminate the acquisition agreement. Then, in March 2020, Astaldi sold its stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi (the SPV) to IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S., with the latter becoming the sole owner.","1.

# Title
ICBC provides $1.2 billion loan to KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi for the construction of the Odayeri-Paşaköy Section of the Northern Marmara Motorway (including Third Bosphorus Bridge) Project

# Description
On May 29, 2012, Turkey's Ministry of Transport granted a 10-year concession agreement to ICA IC İçtaş Astaldi Üçüncü Boğaz Köprüsü ve Kuzey Marmara Otoyolu Yatırım ve İşletme A.Ş. (IC Ictas-Astaldi or ICA) — a joint venture between an Italian construction company called Astaldi S.P.A (33.33% ownership stake) and a Turkish construction company called IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S. (66.66% ownership stake) — for the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project (also known as the Third Bosphorus Bridge PPP Project and the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge PPP Project). 30 months of the 10-year concession is for bridge construction activities and the remaining period is for bridge management activities. The public-private partnership (PPP) project was implemented on a BOT (Build, Operate, Transfer) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. The original, non-recourse $2.67 billion debt financing package consisted of two syndicated loan agreements with two different special purpose vehicles (project companies): a $1.04 billion loan with Avrupa Otoyolu Yatirim ve Iletme A.S. for the 171 km Kurtköy-Akyazı Section (“Asia Section” or “NMM Asia”) of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project and a $1.63 billion loan with KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. for the 90 km Kınalı-Odayeri Section (“Europe Section” or “NMM Europe”) of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project.

62223,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,"ICBC contributes $529 million to $659 million syndicated loan for Port Elizabeth II Upgrading and Expansion Project (Linked to Project ID#62222, #62224)","On March 25, 2015, the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone signed a framework agreement with a consortium of Chinese companies — consisting of Tidfore Heavy Equipment Group Co., Ltd., China Integrity International Oceaneering, Co., Ltd., Tidfore (Tianjin) Oceaneering Equipment Co., Ltd., and Tianjin Jinhao International Trade Co., Ltd. — regarding the design and construction of the works necessary for the expansion and upgrading of Port Elizabeth II in Freetown Port (also known as ‘Queen Elizabeth II Port’). Then, on September 15, 2017, the Sierra Leone Ports Authority, the National Commission for Privatization of the Republic of Sierra Leone, the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone, Sky Rock Management Limited, and National Port Development (SL) Ltd. signed a concession agreement in connection with the Upgrade and Expansion of the Queen Elizabeth II Port in Freetown. The agreement granted National Port Development (SL) Ltd. (塞拉利昂共和国国家港口发展有限公) — a project company and special purpose vehicle (SPV) — the right to expand, upgrade, and operate Queen Elizabeth II Port for 25 years.  On November 29, 2017, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of (ICBC) and the Export-Import Bank of China signed a $659 million syndicated facility (loan) agreement with National Port Development (SL) Ltd. for the Port Elizabeth II Upgrading and Expansion Project. Of the total $659 million (captured via Umbrella Project ID#62222), China Eximbank contributed $130 million (captured via Project ID#62224) and ICBC contributed $529 million (captured via Project ID#62223). The syndicated loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus 350 basis points, a 2% default (penalty) interest rate, and a commitment fee of 0.5%. The loan is secured by (i.e. collateralized against) project revenues/port development levy fees deposited in a lender-controlled bank account, the proceeds from the borrower’s Sinosure credit insurance policy, Sky Rock Management Ltd.’s equity stake (shares) in the project company [National Port Development (SL) Ltd.], project machinery and equipment, and all movable assets (tangible or intangible) of the concessionaire in connection with the ‘New Port’ (as defined in the concession agreement and AidData’s ‘Staff Comments’). Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development issued a sovereign guarantee for the loan, and the borrower was required to use part of the loan proceeds to purchase a credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure), which insures 95% of the facility plus accrued interest against political and commercial risk.  The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower, National Port Development (SL) Ltd., to finance a $708,295,101 commercial contract that it signed with a consortium of Chinese companies -- consisting of Tidfore Heavy Equipment Group Co., Ltd. (泰富重装集), China Integrity International Oceaneering, Co., Ltd., Tidfore (Tianjin) Oceaneering Equipment Co., Ltd., and Tianjin Jinhao International Trade Co., Ltd.-- which was signed on March 8, 2017 and amended on November 29, 2017. In order to facilitate loan repayment, Tidifore will collect a ‘development levy fee,’ which will be charged over and above the usual port handling charges. This fee is expected to generate $950 million over a 16 year period. Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development has reportedly flagged that this fee could raise the cost using the port to such a high level that shippers will avoid using it, thereby leading to an overall loss of revenue and threatening the borrower’s ability to repay the loan (thus raising concerns about the Government of Sierra Leone’s contingent liability).  The purpose of the Port Elizabeth II Upgrading Project is to renovate the facilities at Queen Elizabeth II Quay in Freetown, which is operated by Sierra Leone Ports Authority. It involves the design and construction of four new terminals and yards for the quay. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on November 29, 2017, and construction began in December 2017.  This project has become a source of local controversy and scrutiny. In 2018, the implementation of the project was reportedly halted (at least temporarily) after reports emerged that the legal entity responsible for the project—National Port Development (SL) Ltd.—was owned by Israeli businessman who had generously contributed to the President of Sierra Leone’s reelection campaign during the previous year. The IMF also sounded the alarm after learning that Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee in support of a syndicated loan, which placed an extraordinarily large contingent liability (worth 15% of the country’s GDP) on the government’s books.","1. This project is also known as the Queen Elizabeth II Quay Upgrading Project. The Chinese project title is 重装塞拉利昂弗里敦伊丽莎白二世港改扩建工程建 or 塞拉利昂弗里敦伊丽莎白二世港改扩建工程建 or 弗里敦伊丽莎白二世港口改扩建工程 or 非洲塞拉利昂港口改扩建项目 or 弗里敦伊丽莎白二世港改扩建 or 弗里敦伊丽莎白二世港改扩建.2. AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate (5.126%) by adding 3.5% to average 6-month LIBOR rate during the month (November 2017) when the loan agreement was finalized (1.626%).3. This loan is not included in the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020.4. No sources explicitly state that this is a buyer's credit loan. AidData assumes this is the case for the following reasons: (1) The loan is provided to a foreign borrower, (2) the loan is denominated in USD, (3) the face value of the loan is explicitly identified in multiple official sources, (4) the loan is used to finance a commercial contract with a Chinese company, and (5) the loan was insured by Sinosure via its export buyer's credit insurance service, which is specifically used when banks are providing buyer's credit financing.5. The syndicated loan agreement can be accessed in its entirety via https://www.dropbox.com/s/9s9cun72yezhkds/ICBC%20Facility%20Agreement%20with%20National%20Port%20Development%20%28SL%29%20LTD..pdf?dl=0.6. The EPC contract can be accessed in its entirety via https://www.dropbox.com/s/vmrr5kscclmga0d/EPC%20Contract.pdf?dl=0.7. The concession agreement can be accessed in its entirety via https://www.dropbox.com/s/asxeufc4d8ekfhp/Concession%20Agreement%20No.354.pdf?dl=0.8. The Facility Agreement references the following Security Documents: (a) Share Pledge Agreement: Sky Rock Ltd., the foreign investor, enters a share pledge agreement ‘in respect of their shares in the Borrower in favour of the Security Agent, in form and substance satisfactory to the Facility Agent’ (p. 18). The Share Pledge Agreement is separate from the Facility Agreement and not publicly available, so it is unknown under what circumstances ownership in the project company could be transferred from the foreign investor to the creditors. (b) Mortgage over Assets: The Borrower enters a mortgage agreement over ‘equipment and other assets of the Borrower in relation to the Project […] in favour of the Finance Parties, in form and substance satisfactory to the Facility Agent’ (p. 13). The Mortgage Agreement is separate from the Facility Agreement and not public, so it is unknown which assets are pledged. (c) Other security documents which evidence or create ‘security over any asset of the Borrower to secure any obligation of the Borrower under the Finance Documents’ (p. 17). Since no other security documents are publicly available, no further details are known. In addition to the Security Documents, the Facility Agreement references an Account Agreement. Again, this is a separate document that is not publicly available. Cross references in the Facility Agreement show that ICBC and China Eximbank can designate ‘a bank outside the jurisdiction of Sierra Leone’ at which the ‘Bank Accounts are opened and maintained’ (p. 1). The conditions of utilization further reveal that the Borrower is required to transfer project revenue into this account so that the account balance at all times meets the minimum debt service coverage of ‘all principal scheduled to be paid and all interested expected to be payable under the Facility on the next Interest Payment Date’ (p. 16). In addition, the repayment of the loan is fully guaranteed by Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance. In particular, the Ministry ‘guarantees to ensure that if […] the balance of the Borrower Collection Account falls to an amount that is less than is required to meet the next Scheduled Debt Service payment […], the Guarantor shall pay, or procure to be paid, into that account, such amount as may be necessary to ensure that the balance of the account is equal to the amount of the next Scheduled Debt Service payment’ (p. 143). The Concession Agreement specifies that ‘the Concessionaire shall be entitled to create Security over its rights, title, and interest in the Port Development Levy Fees and the New Port Assets in favor of the Finance Parties for the purpose of the Financing provided that any such Security shall not continue for a period exceeding the Concession Term. The Concessionaire may enter into all such transactions, and may become party to the related debt obligations that may be evidenced or secured by the Finance Documents.’ Through the agreement, the Government of Sierra Leone granted the Concessionaire ‘a first ranking Security over all Port Development Levy Fees and New Port Assets.’ The concession agreement defines the ‘New Port’ as ‘four (4) Berths, and container, bulk Cargo or vehicle handling facilities (including quay walls and other infrastructure and superstructure and all fixtures, fittings and machinery, apparatus, equipment and any other moveable assets of any nature), navigation and navaid facilities, storage yards or warehouse, or any ancillary or auxiliary works relating to such Berths to be developed and constructed by the Concessionaire at the Queen Elizabeth II Quay in Freetown Siena Leone’; ‘New Port Assets’ as ‘any and all machinery and equipment attached to the land within the Exclusive Area and all movable assets (tangible or intangible) of the Concessionaire in connection with the New Port’; the ‘Existing Port Development Levy Fee’ as ‘the fees charged by the Concessionaire to the Existing Port Carriers in connection with the use of the Existing Port by the Existing Port Carriers in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Existing Port Development Levy Fee Act; the ‘New Port Development Levy Fee’ as the fee charged by the Concessionaire to the New Port Carriers in connection with the transhipment of containers, bulk Cargos or vehicles at the New Port by are New Port Carriers in accordance with the term of this Agreement and the New Port Development Levy Fee Act’; ‘Port Development Levy Fees’ as ‘the Existing Port Development Levy Fee and the New Port Development Levy Fee’; and ‘Security’ as ‘mortgage, charge, pledge, lien, or other security interest securing any obligation of any Person or any other agreement or arrangement having a similar effect.’ The Government of Sierra Leone granted the Concessionaire ‘a first ranking Security over all Port Development Levy Fees and New Port Assets’. The Concession Agreement also specifies that the lenders all have security over the ‘insurance proceeds until all sums due and owing by the Concessionaire to the Finance Parties shall have been paid in full.’9.

# Title
ICBC contributes $529 million to $659 million syndicated loan for Port Elizabeth II Upgrading and Expansion Project (Linked to Project ID#62222, #62224)

# Description
On March 25, 2015, the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone signed a framework agreement with a consortium of Chinese companies — consisting of Tidfore Heavy Equipment Group Co., Ltd., China Integrity International Oceaneering, Co., Ltd., Tidfore (Tianjin) Oceaneering Equipment Co., Ltd., and Tianjin Jinhao International Trade Co., Ltd. — regarding the design and construction of the works necessary for the expansion and upgrading of Port Elizabeth II in Freetown Port (also known as ‘Queen Elizabeth II Port’). Then, on September 15, 2017, the Sierra Leone Ports Authority, the National Commission for Privatization of the Republic of Sierra Leone, the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone, Sky Rock Management Limited, and National Port Development (SL) Ltd. signed a concession agreement in connection with the Upgrade and Expansion of the Queen Elizabeth II Port in Freetown. The agreement granted National Port Development (SL) Ltd. (塞拉利昂共和国国家港口发展有限公) — a project company and special purpose vehicle (SPV) — the right to expand, upgrade, and operate Queen Elizabeth II Port for 25 years.  On November 29, 2017, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of (ICBC) and the Export-Import Bank of China signed a $659 million syndicated facility (loan) agreement with National Port Development (SL) Ltd. for the Port Elizabeth II Upgrading and Expansion Project. Of the total $659 million (captured via Umbrella Project ID#62222), China Eximbank contributed $130 million (captured via Project ID#62224) and ICBC contributed $529 million (captured via Project ID#62223). The syndicated loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus 350 basis points, a 2% default (penalty) interest rate, and a commitment fee of 0.5%. The loan is secured by (i.e. collateralized against) project revenues/port development levy fees deposited in a lender-controlled bank account, the proceeds from the borrower’s Sinosure credit insurance policy, Sky Rock Management Ltd.’s equity stake (shares) in the project company [National Port Development (SL) Ltd.], project machinery and equipment, and all movable assets (tangible or intangible) of the concessionaire in connection with the ‘New Port’ (as defined in the concession agreement and AidData’s ‘Staff Comments’). Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development issued a sovereign guarantee for the loan, and the borrower was required to use part of the loan proceeds to purchase a credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure), which insures 95% of the facility plus accrued interest against political and commercial risk.  The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower, National Port Development (SL) Ltd., to finance a $708,295,101 commercial contract that it signed with a consortium of Chinese companies -- consisting of Tidfore Heavy Equipment Group Co., Ltd. (泰富重装集), China Integrity International Oceaneering, Co., Ltd., Tidfore (Tianjin) Oceaneering Equipment Co., Ltd., and Tianjin Jinhao International Trade Co., Ltd.-- which was signed on March 8, 2017 and amended on November 29, 2017. In order to facilitate loan repayment, Tidifore will collect a ‘development levy fee,’ which will be charged over and above the usual port handling charges. This fee is expected to generate $950 million over a 16 year period. Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development has reportedly flagged that this fee could raise the cost using the port to such a high level that shippers will avoid using it, thereby leading to an overall loss of revenue and threatening the borrower’s ability to repay the loan (thus raising concerns about the Government of Sierra Leone’s contingent liability).  The purpose of the Port Elizabeth II Upgrading Project is to renovate the facilities at Queen Elizabeth II Quay in Freetown, which is operated by Sierra Leone Ports Authority. It involves the design and construction of four new terminals and yards for the quay. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on November 29, 2017, and construction began in December 2017.  This project has become a source of local controversy and scrutiny. In 2018, the implementation of the project was reportedly halted (at least temporarily) after reports emerged that the legal entity responsible for the project—National Port Development (SL) Ltd.—was owned by Israeli businessman who had generously contributed to the President of Sierra Leone’s reelection campaign during the previous year. The IMF also sounded the alarm after learning that Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee in support of a syndicated loan, which placed an extraordinarily large contingent liability (worth 15% of the country’s GDP) on the government’s books.

1. This project is also known as the Queen Elizabeth II Quay Upgrading Project. The Chinese project title is 重装塞拉利昂弗里敦伊丽莎白二世港改扩建工程建 or 塞拉利昂弗里敦伊丽莎白二世港改扩建工程建 or 弗里敦伊丽莎白二世港口改扩建工程 or 非洲塞拉利昂港口改扩建项目 or 弗里敦伊丽莎白二世港改扩建 or 弗里敦伊丽莎白二世港改扩建.2. AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate (5.126%) by adding 3.5% to average 6-month LIBOR rate during the month (November 2017) when the loan agreement was finalized (1.626%).3. This loan is not included in the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020.4. No sources explicitly state that this is a buyer's credit loan. AidData assumes this is the case for the following reasons: (1) The loan is provided to a foreign borrower, (2) the loan is denominated in USD, (3) the face value of the loan is explicitly identified in multiple official sources, (4) the loan is used to finance a commercial contract with a Chinese company, and (5) the loan was insured by Sinosure via its export buyer's credit insurance service, which is specifically used when banks are providing buyer's credit financing.5. The syndicated loan agreement can be accessed in its entirety via https://www.dropbox.com/s/9s9cun72yezhkds/ICBC%20Facility%20Agreement%20with%20National%20Port%20Development%20%28SL%29%20LTD..pdf?dl=0.6. The EPC contract can be accessed in its entirety via https://www.dropbox.com/s/vmrr5kscclmga0d/EPC%20Contract.pdf?dl=0.7. The concession agreement can be accessed in its entirety via https://www.dropbox.com/s/asxeufc4d8ekfhp/Concession%20Agreement%20No.354.pdf?dl=0.8. The Facility Agreement references the following Security Documents: (a) Share Pledge Agreement: Sky Rock Ltd., the foreign investor, enters a share pledge agreement ‘in respect of their shares in the Borrower in favour of the Security Agent, in form and substance satisfactory to the Facility Agent’ (p. 18). The Share Pledge Agreement is separate from the Facility Agreement and not publicly available, so it is unknown under what circumstances ownership in the project company could be transferred from the foreign investor to the creditors. (b) Mortgage over Assets: The Borrower enters a mortgage agreement over ‘equipment and other assets of the Borrower in relation to the Project […] in favour of the Finance Parties, in form and substance satisfactory to the Facility Agent’ (p. 13). The Mortgage Agreement is separate from the Facility Agreement and not public, so it is unknown which assets are pledged. (c) Other security documents which evidence or create ‘security over any asset of the Borrower to secure any obligation of the Borrower under the Finance Documents’ (p. 17). Since no other security documents are publicly available, no further details are known. In addition to the Security Documents, the Facility Agreement references an Account Agreement. Again, this is a separate document that is not publicly available. Cross references in the Facility Agreement show that ICBC and China Eximbank can designate ‘a bank outside the jurisdiction of Sierra Leone’ at which the ‘Bank Accounts are opened and maintained’ (p. 1). The conditions of utilization further reveal that the Borrower is required to transfer project revenue into this account so that the account balance at all times meets the minimum debt service coverage of ‘all principal scheduled to be paid and all interested expected to be payable under the Facility on the next Interest Payment Date’ (p. 16). In addition, the repayment of the loan is fully guaranteed by Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance. In particular, the Ministry ‘guarantees to ensure that if […] the balance of the Borrower Collection Account falls to an amount that is less than is required to meet the next Scheduled Debt Service payment […], the Guarantor shall pay, or procure to be paid, into that account, such amount as may be necessary to ensure that the balance of the account is equal to the amount of the next Scheduled Debt Service payment’ (p. 143). The Concession Agreement specifies that ‘the Concessionaire shall be entitled to create Security over its rights, title, and interest in the Port Development Levy Fees and the New Port Assets in favor of the Finance Parties for the purpose of the Financing provided that any such Security shall not continue for a period exceeding the Concession Term. The Concessionaire may enter into all such transactions, and may become party to the related debt obligations that may be evidenced or secured by the Finance Documents.’ Through the agreement, the Government of Sierra Leone granted the Concessionaire ‘a first ranking Security over all Port Development Levy Fees and New Port Assets.’ The concession agreement defines the ‘New Port’ as ‘four (4) Berths, and container, bulk Cargo or vehicle handling facilities (including quay walls and other infrastructure and superstructure and all fixtures, fittings and machinery, apparatus, equipment and any other moveable assets of any nature), navigation and navaid facilities, storage yards or warehouse, or any ancillary or auxiliary works relating to such Berths to be developed and constructed by the Concessionaire at the Queen Elizabeth II Quay in Freetown Siena Leone’; ‘New Port Assets’ as ‘any and all machinery and equipment attached to the land within the Exclusive Area and all movable assets (tangible or intangible) of the Concessionaire in connection with the New Port’; the ‘Existing Port Development Levy Fee’ as ‘the fees charged by the Concessionaire to the Existing Port Carriers in connection with the use of the Existing Port by the Existing Port Carriers in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Existing Port Development Levy Fee Act; the ‘New Port Development Levy Fee’ as the fee charged by the Concessionaire to the New Port Carriers in connection with the transhipment of containers, bulk Cargos or vehicles at the New Port by are New Port Carriers in accordance with the term of this Agreement and the New Port Development Levy Fee Act’; ‘Port Development Levy Fees’ as ‘the Existing Port Development Levy Fee and the New Port Development Levy Fee’; and ‘Security’ as ‘mortgage, charge, pledge, lien, or other security interest securing any obligation of any Person or any other agreement or arrangement having a similar effect.’ The Government of Sierra Leone granted the Concessionaire ‘a first ranking Security over all Port Development Levy Fees and New Port Assets’. The Concession Agreement also specifies that the lenders all have security over the ‘insurance proceeds until all sums due and owing by the Concessionaire to the Finance Parties shall have been paid in full.’9.

The MOU indicated that China Eximbank was willing, in principle, to lend as much as $248 million to ADM for the project. According to the MOU, China International Water & Electric Corporation (CWE) and China Overseas Engineering Group (COVEC) would be responsible for the construction of several segments of the expressway.  The Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) also agreed to contribute KD 55 million and EUR 220 million, respectively, for the project.    The purpose of the project was to construct a two-way, four-lane, 173 km expressway from Berrechid to Beni Mellal that runs straight through the Atlas Mountains. The expressway would run parallel to highway N11 and it was designed to relieve traffic on highway N11. The Berrechid–Beni Mellal Expressway Construction Project consisted of five sections. The first section between Berrechid and Ben Ahmed (38.6 km) was built by CWE. It originates on the existing Casablanca-Settat motorway north of Berrechid. It then bypasses the city of Morjana (PK 3) from the south and passes north of the Mbarkine region. It crosses the RP 3602 and the RP3625 at the level of the Oulad Sghir locality. It then crosses, in Lourarga, the RP3606 and bypasses the mountainous area of ​​Oulad Amar to the north before crossing the RR305 at Oulad Damar (PK 35). The second section, between Ben Ahmed and Khouribga (38.5 km) and the third section between Khouribga and Oued Zem (33 km), was built by four local Moroccan contractors: Société Internationale De Travaux Maroc (SINTRAM), LRN, Seprob and the Société Nouvelle Des Conduites d'Eau (SNCE). The fourth section between Oued Zem and Kasba Tadla (40 km) was built by a Moroccan contractor, Houar. The fifth section, between Kasba Tadla and Beni Mellal (22 km) was built by COVEC.

This loan carried an interest rate of 2%. However, its grace period and maturity length are unknown. The borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $216 million commercial (EPC) contract with CWE. It also agreed to repay the loan with toll road revenue. CWE was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on April 12, 2010. However, the project did not commence until April 16, 2010. It ultimately took 63 months to complete. The road was officially opened to traffic on July 16, 2015.   With traffic estimated at 3,700 vehicles per day (as of 2018), the Berrechid–Beni Mellal (A4) Expressway serves the cities of Ben Ahmed, Khouribga, Oued Zem, Bejaad and Kasba Tadla.

China Eximbank provides $68 million loan to Serbia Zijin Copper Doo Bor for its working capital needs

# Description
On August 31, 2018, Zijin Mining Group purchased a 63% ownership stake in Rudarsko-Topioničarski Basen RTB Bor Doo (or ‘RTB Bor’) — a state-owned copper mining and smelting complex located in Bor, Serbia — in a $1.26 billion deal with the Government of Serbia. The agreement was part of the Government of Serbia’s broader efforts to sell-off indebted state-run companies to help spur growth and relieve pressure on the budget, as recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). As part of the agreement, Zijin Mining Group promised to cover RTB Bor’s $200 million debt and keep 5,000 jobs at the mine. Out of the $1.26 billion, Zijin Mining Group said that $135 million would be invested in improving the environment while another $320 million in opening a new copper mine.   Then, in 2021, the Paris Branch of China Eximbank and Serbia Zijin Copper Doo Bor (塞尔维亚紫金铜业) — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of Zijin Mining Group (63% ownership stake) and Rudarsko-Topioničarski Basen RTB Bor Doo (37% ownership stake) — signed a $68 million term loan facility agreement. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was expected to use the loan proceeds for its working capital needs. Zijin Mining Group issued a corporate guarantee in support of this loan.

57288,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides $129.7 million buyer’s credit for 122 km Kawambwa to Mporokoso (D019) Road Upgrade Project,"On June 27, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Zambia signed a $129,734,105.49 million buyer’s credit (loan) agreement for the 122 km Kawambwa to Mporokoso (D019) Road Upgrade Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of a $142.28 million commercial contact between Zambia's Road Development Agency and China Harbour Engineering Limited, Ltd (CHEC), which was signed in July 2016. As of July 2022, the loan from China Eximbank had achieved a 10.1% disbursement rate ($13,219,206.11 out of $129,734,105.49).    The purpose of the project is to upgrade a 122 km stretch of the D019 road between Kawambwa to Mporokoso from gravel to the bituminous standard. CHEC is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 27, 2017. However, virtually no progress was made during 2018, with a project completion rate of 2%. Consequently, the project’s intended completion date was pushed back until July 23, 2021. According the Zambian Road Development Agency's 2020 Work Plan, construction is ongoing, but a March 9, 2020 media report says the project experienced further delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   This project has also been plagued by allegations of corruption. In June 2019, Christopher Siwakwi, an investigations officer from Zambia’s Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), told the Lusaka Magistrates’ Court that foreign currency (USD) moved from a CHEC bank account to purchase two properties allegedly owned by Zambian Infrastructure and Housing Minister Ronald Chitotela. Siwakwi, however, testified that the properties — lot number 148 of farm 50A and subdivision A of lot 22183 /M  Ibex Hill — were established to be in the names of the previous owners, Mary Lubinga and Former Labour Minister Austin Liato.  Ronald Chitotela, Gregory Chibanga and Brut Holdings were charged with two counts of concealing the two properties while Diris Mukange was charged with two counts of possession of the same properties, which are suspected to be proceeds of crime. They all pled not guilty. During the trial before principal resident magistrate David Simusamba, Christopher Siwakwi said his investigations established that the contract for the sale of the properties was in the name of Diris Mukange (as a buyer for both properties), while the negotiations for the prices were done by Ronald Chitotela and his wife when he was Deputy Minister for Sports and Youth Development. Siwakwi said the price of the property in Makeni was K1.6 million while the Ibex Hill one was purchased at K1.8 million, adding that the source of income to buy the same was tracked back to CHEC. Siwakwi recounted how ACC in June 2017 received a complaint that Ronald Chitotela was in possession of property suspected to have been proceeds of crime and had received a bribe from CHEC. Siwakwi said ACC also received additional information that the money used to purchase the properties originated from CHEC. Siwakwi said the ACC team embarked on investigations to establish whether the allegations were founded. Siwakwi said he visited the Bank of China where he established that China Harbour had a U.S. dollar account with the bank which transferred $300,000 to Andrews and Partners on July 27, 2016 at its FNB bank account which was payment for legal services and attached to the bank statement was a contract for the upgrading of Kawambwa-Mporokoso road.   On July 29, 2022, the Ministry of Finance & National Planning (MOFNP) of Zambia announced that it was seeking lender approval to formally cancel the loan’s undisbursed balance ($116,514,899.38); however, it also noted that it had not yet secured formal lender approval for this action. This announcement came approximately 21 months after the Government of Zambia defaulted on its repayment obligations to Eurobond holders and approximately 6 weeks after China, France, and 14 other countries formed a creditor committee to discuss the Zambian authorities’ request for a debt treatment under ‘the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the DSSI’ endorsed by the G20 and the Paris Club.","1.

(2014) 6 TOTAL NO. (300)] with Cameroon's Ministry of Economy, Planning, and Regional Development (MINEPAT) for the Kribi-Lolabe Highway Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a commitment fee of 0.25%, a management fee of 0.25%, a grace period of 5 years, and a maturity of 20 years. The borrower agreed to deposit project-related revenues in a special account to facilitate repayment. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the total cost ($453,892,716.00) of a commercial contract between the Steering and Monitoring Committee of the Kribi Industrial and Port Complex of Cameroon and China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd., which was signed on November 28, 2012. The remaining 15% was to be covered by the Government of Cameroon's MINEPAT.   As of December 31, 2020, the loan (PBC) had achieved a 80.6% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 40.1 billion). The loan’s outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 163.5 billion as of December 31, 2020.   The purpose of this 38.5 km (+4.5km) highway construction project is to facilitate access to the Kribi deep-sea port. It involves construction of a 38.5 km 2x2-lane highway, starting from Mboro village and running to Bibolo in the Kribi II district. It also includes the construction of 4.5 km of road that connects Kribi-Lolabe highway to the Edéa-Kribi highway (or Nationale 7 Edéa-Kribi).   China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. is the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction commenced on January 1, 2015. However, it was temporarily halted on November 26, 2018 due to (a) the failure to appoint a highway operator, (b) the failure to sign an escrow account agreement, and (c) and accumulated payment arrears worth CFA 75.5 billion. As of March 2019, the project had achieved an 88% completion rate. Then, during last few months of 2019, construction was again temporarily halted before resuming in January 2020. CHEC and the Cameroon Ministry of Public Works stated that the project had achieved an 88.14% completion as of January 2020. Then, on December 30, 2020, Cameroon’s Minister of Public Works and Minister of Finance signed a public-private partnership (PPP) contract with CHEC to finance the Cameroonian Government’s 15% of the project cost, tacitly acknowledging that the Cameroonian Government could not honor its commitment to finance 15% of the commercial contract cost due to a series of crises. The timeline for completion of the project was subsequently revised to August 2021. As of November 3, 2021, the project had achieved a 98.19% completion rate. The project achieved provisional acceptance (completion) on December 31, 2021.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Kribi-Lolabe Highway Construction Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.’","1.

The loan’s outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 163.5 billion as of December 31, 2020.   The purpose of this 38.5 km (+4.5km) highway construction project is to facilitate access to the Kribi deep-sea port. It involves construction of a 38.5 km 2x2-lane highway, starting from Mboro village and running to Bibolo in the Kribi II district. It also includes the construction of 4.5 km of road that connects Kribi-Lolabe highway to the Edéa-Kribi highway (or Nationale 7 Edéa-Kribi).   China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. is the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction commenced on January 1, 2015. However, it was temporarily halted on November 26, 2018 due to (a) the failure to appoint a highway operator, (b) the failure to sign an escrow account agreement, and (c) and accumulated payment arrears worth CFA 75.5 billion. As of March 2019, the project had achieved an 88% completion rate. Then, during last few months of 2019, construction was again temporarily halted before resuming in January 2020. CHEC and the Cameroon Ministry of Public Works stated that the project had achieved an 88.14% completion as of January 2020. Then, on December 30, 2020, Cameroon’s Minister of Public Works and Minister of Finance signed a public-private partnership (PPP) contract with CHEC to finance the Cameroonian Government’s 15% of the project cost, tacitly acknowledging that the Cameroonian Government could not honor its commitment to finance 15% of the commercial contract cost due to a series of crises. The timeline for completion of the project was subsequently revised to August 2021. As of November 3, 2021, the project had achieved a 98.19% completion rate. The project achieved provisional acceptance (completion) on December 31, 2021.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Kribi-Lolabe Highway Construction Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.’

It is a subsidiary of Zonergy, itself a subsidiary of ZTE Corporation. On December 21, 2015, China Eximbank, China Bohai Bank, and CEPL signed a term facility agreement with three tranches. China Eximbank provided two different loan tranches to CEPL: (1) an RMB 100 million loan tranche with a 2.65% interest rate and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#54283) and (2) a $40.81 million loan with an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 4.2% margin and a 10-year maturity (captured via Project ID#53988).

The $149,457,000 project was financed with a debt:equity ratio of 75:25. These three loans from China Eximbank and China Bohai Bank constitute the debt component. It is unclear how the equity portion was financed.   On June 27, 2015, CEPL signed EPC contracts with China First Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd. and MCC Ruba International Construction Company Pvt.

The plant began commercial operations on July 31, 2016.   However, this project appears to have encountered debt repayment and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. On October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this “[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).","1. According to multiple, official sources, the Government of Pakistan has issued sovereign guarantees in support of all loans issued by Chinese state-owned banks for independent power projects (IPPs) in Pakistan (see https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cepk/chn/zbgx/t1735166.htm and http://pk.chineseembassy.org/eng/zbgx/202110/t20211010_9558510.htm and https://www.dropbox.com/s/bmx3w2b38o7guxm/Debt%20Pricing%20of%20IPPs%20%28002%29.pdf?dl=0).

Then, in September 2017, the Power Division forwarded a draft Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) to be signed between Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guaranteed (CPPA-G) and power producer(s) to the Finance Division. CPPA-G subsequently executed the finalized draft of RAA with multiple CPEC IPPs. The Government of Pakistan also guaranteed the funding obligations of the CPPA with respect to the RAA, through Supplemental Implementation Agreements signed between the Government of Pakistan — through the Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) — and the respective IPPs. 3.

The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this “[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).

1. According to multiple, official sources, the Government of Pakistan has issued sovereign guarantees in support of all loans issued by Chinese state-owned banks for independent power projects (IPPs) in Pakistan (see https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cepk/chn/zbgx/t1735166.htm and http://pk.chineseembassy.org/eng/zbgx/202110/t20211010_9558510.htm and https://www.dropbox.com/s/bmx3w2b38o7guxm/Debt%20Pricing%20of%20IPPs%20%28002%29.pdf?dl=0). As such, AidData assumes that the loan captured in this record is backed by a sovereign guarantee from the Government of Pakistan. 2. On November 8, 2014, the Chinese Government and the Government of Pakistan signed a CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement. According to Article 5 of the Agreement, ‘the Pakistani Party agrees that a revolving account shall be opened with 30 days of commercial operation of the respective project, into which the money, no less than the 22 per cent of the monthly payments for the respective power project under the agreement shall be deposited to provide cover for the shortfall in power bill recoveries from the date of power generation of the said projects agreements subject to the condition that the additional direct and indirect expenses incurred in maintaining the revolving account would be compensated by the producers through a discount arrangement to be mutually agreed.’ Subsequently, the Finance Division, in consultation with the Power Division, finalized a mechanism for the Revolving Account (RA) with the approval of The Minister of Finance in a letter dated June 22, 2015. Then, in September 2017, the Power Division forwarded a draft Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) to be signed between Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guaranteed (CPPA-G) and power producer(s) to the Finance Division. CPPA-G subsequently executed the finalized draft of RAA with multiple CPEC IPPs. The Government of Pakistan also guaranteed the funding obligations of the CPPA with respect to the RAA, through Supplemental Implementation Agreements signed between the Government of Pakistan — through the Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) — and the respective IPPs. 3. This is one of ten solar power plants at Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park financed by CDB and China Eximbank (captured via Umbrella Project ID#50939). 4. AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate for the $40.81 million loan by adding 4.2% to average 6-month LIBOR in December 2015 (0.764%). AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate for the $56.19 million loan by adding 4.35% to average 6-month LIBOR in December 2015 (0.764%)."

85359,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",Bank of China contributes to a $884 million USD syndicated loan for Tangguh Liquefied Natural Gas Project (Linked to Project ID#97811),"On October 29, 2007, a syndicate of banks (including Bank of China, BTMU, DNB, Intesa San Paulo, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., and Royal Bank of Scotland) signed an $884 million loan agreement with a trustee [HSBC USA (New York)] and Japan International Finance Management (Tangguh) Corporation — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) — for the Tangguh Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project. The loan carried a maturity of 13.6 years and an interest rate of LIBOR (October 2007 6M LIBOR: 5.051%) plus a 0.335% margin. China National Offshore Oil Corporation  (CNOOC) — a Chinese state-owned enterprise — issued a corporate guarantee in support of the loan. Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., served as the facility agent for the loan.   The $884 million loan, known as the ‘Fujian tranche,’ is ring-fenced from the rest of the project and the revenues to service it will be drawn from the 25-year contract to supply 2.6 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG to CNOOC, initially through the latter’s Fujian LNG-receiving terminal. Under the trustee borrowing structure, loans are repaid from an agreed portion of gross proceeds under identified offtake contracts. The buyers make payments directly to the trustee and paying agent [HSBC USA (New York)]. The trustee is also the borrower under the loan agreement with the lenders, and the debt service payments are made from the trustee accounts. Except as otherwise provided, the lenders look to this source of debt service for all loans, with no recourse to the project and no security interest in the project assets or contracts.   Prior to the issuance of this loan, several other loans were issued for the same project: a $1.2 billion loan from Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), a $350 million loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), a $1.066 billion syndicated loan from a group of commercial banks, and an August 2006 $1.3 billion USD syndicated term loan from a syndicate of five Chinese state-owned banks — Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), China Construction Bank Corporation (CCB), China Development Bank (CB), the Export-Import Bank of China, and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) — as captured via Project ID#97811.  The debt financing package involves a complex multi-tranche Indonesian trustee borrowing structure. Repayment of the loans is supported by revenues from long-term LNG sale and purchase agreements with K-Power in South Korea, POSCO in South Korea and Sempra Energy via a receiving terminal in Mexico.   The purpose of the project is to construct an integrated greenfield liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility — with two LNG process trains (Train 1 and 2) — on the south side of Bintuni Bay in Teluk Bintuni Regency within Papua Barat Province. The LNG plant is comprised of two main components: (i) the offshore gas production facilities including 14 producing wells, 2 platforms (“trains”), and subsea pipelines to feed gas to the onshore facilities; and (ii) the onshore LNG production facilities and associated facilities, which include two identical production trains (Train 1 and 2), storage tanks for LNG (2 x 170,000 m3 ) and condensate (1 x 120,000 barrel), marine berthing facilities, utilities, offices and living facilities, off-site camp, airfield and jetty. Design optimizations together with deferral of the airfield and associated access road almost halved the site footprint. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the project would have 7.6 million tons per annum (mtpa) of production capacity to the existing Tangguh LNG facility.   The Tangguh Liquefied Natural Gas Project took shape in the mid-1990s upon the discovery of substantial gas reserves in the area. Proven reserves are around 14.4 trillion cubic feet (TCF). The project was initiated in 1997 by Atlantic Richfield Company (a US oil company) and Pertamina (a state-owned oil and gas enterprise). In April 1999, BP Plc (BP) acquired Atlantic Richfield Company and took over its lead role. Its 7 gas fields, under production-sharing contracts (PSCs), are developed under a partnership between consortia of international contractors (the PSC Contractors) and BPMIGAS as the governmental counterparty. The PSC Contractors, led by BP Berau as the Operator, operate jointly in upstream development and LNG processing for export to international markets. In May 2003, BP approached multilateral and bilateral financial institutions to seek financial assistance together with a commitment to assist the project in implementing best practices following international environmental and social guidelines.    The project began construction following the resettlement in July 2004 of Tanah Merah village (the LNG plant site). Engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contracts were entered into with a consortium of Kellogg Overseas Corporation, JGC, and PT Pertafenikki (KJP; for onshore facilities) and with PT Saipem Indonesia (for offshore facilities) in March 2005, followed by immediate issuance of the notice to proceed to start the construction. As of March 2007, the project had achieved a 70% completion rate. The offshore facilities were handed over to the project owner by May 2007. The onshore facilities were ready for start-up in January 2009 (Train 1) and June (Train 2) 2009. The first LNG production (first drop) occurred in Train 1 in June 2009. The first LNG shipment was made on July 6, 2009 using the Tangguh Foja LNG carrier.  Following the project’s achievement of ready for start-up status in 2009, the start-up process continued until mid-2011 to address technical issues, perform modification works, and ensure the stable operation and higher production efficiency of the LNG plant. Over a 3-year period from first drop in June 2009 up to June 2012 the project had produced a total of 37.8 million m3 of LNG and 5.1 million barrels of condensate.

The borrower was required to keep a minimum deposit balance of 15-20% of total outstanding loans in an escrow account. All subsidiary loans approved through this framework agreement were to carry the following terms: a 5-year grace period, a 20-year maturity and a 0.25% interest rate.    According to the Congolese authorities, only one subsidiary loan was ultimately approved through this framework agreement: a $1 billion loan in 2012 for the Dolisie-Brazzavile Section of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project (captured in Project ID#369). The loan’s (principal) amount outstanding was $1,000,000,000 as of December 31, 2019.  This project, which is also known as Phase 2 of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project, involved the construction of a 376 km road segment along National Route 1 (NR1) between Dolisie and PK45 north of Brazzaville.

China State Construction Engineering Corporation Ltd. (CSCEC) was the contractor responsible for the implementation of Phase 1 and Phase 2.

The four-lane, 535 km Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) was officially inaugurated on March 1, 2016.    The $1 billion China Eximbank loan that supported Phase 2 was rescheduled on April 29, 2019. Under the terms of the debt rescheduling agreement, the Republic of Congo agreed to repay 33% of its its outstanding obligations for the Phase 2 (375 km Dolisie-Brazzaville Section) of National Route 1 (RN1) Construction Project within 3 years (more specifically, by December 31, 2021). For the remaining 67% of its outstanding obligations, the Republic of Congo agreed to a new repayment schedule that involved extending the maturity the loan by 15 years (from 20 years to 35 years) and resetting the interest rate of the loan from 0.25% to to 2%.  This debt rescheduling is captured in Project ID#58340.

Under this new agreement, CSCEC is responsible for maintaining the road while the French company, Egis, is responsible for managing toll collection. The CSCEC’s upfront equity investment in this public-private partnership (PPP) helped the Republic of Congo address its balance of payments crisis.

73183,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides $6.4 million export seller's credit to CWE for Volta Lake Resettlement Township Electrification Sub-Project of the Upper West Electrification Project (linked to #1243),"On March 2, 2000, the Government of Ghana signed a supplier credit agreement worth approximately $29.5 million with China International Water & Electric Corporation (CWE) for the Volta Lake Resettlement Township Electrification Sub-Project of the Upper West Electrification Project. The CWE supplier credit was provided through an RMB-denominated tranche (RMB 162 million) and a USD-denominated tranche ($6.4 million). Both tranches carried the following terms: 2% interest rate, 10 year maturity, and a 3 year grace period. This project entry captures the USD-denominated loan and project #1243 captures the RMB-denominated loan. The proceeds from both loan tranches were used to finance the extension of electricity to 106 townships (in Brong Ahafo Region, Eastern Region, Northern Region, and Volta Region) under the Volta Lake Resettlement Scheme.   In order to finance its supplier credit agreement with the Government of Ghana, CWE secured an export seller’s credit on September 8, 2000 from China Eximbank with an 11 year maturity. The loan terms captured in this project entry, however, are those of the supplier credit from CWE to Ghana.  Feasibility studies identified a total of 171 townships along the Volta Lake to benefit from the project, but due to the large number of towns involved, the project was carried out in phases. The first phase, which involved the electrification of 106 townships, had an estimated total cost of $32.8 million. CWE provided $29.5 million, covering approximately 90 percent of the total cost. The Government of Ghana was required to contribute the remaining 10% ($2.8 million dollars) as counterpart funding. CWE was the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction began in 2002 and ended in 203. However, the precise project completion date is unknown.","1. The Chinese project title is 的沃尔特湖移民村镇电气化项目. 2. Some media sources indicate that Ghana’s Parliament approved the supplier credit agreement in December 1999 rather than March 2000. However, the Government of Ghana’s Controller & Accountant General's Department records the loan commitment year as 2000.3.  In the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020, it records a maturity of 11 years for this supplier credit but does not record an interest rate or grace period. AidData records the maturity (10 years), interest rate (2%), and grace period (3 years) reported at the time that Ghana’s Parliament approved the supplier credit. The 11-year maturity recorded by SAIS-CARI appears to refer to the term of the export seller’s credit that CWE secured from China Eximbank rather than the term of the supplier credit that CWE provided to the Government of Ghana.","# Sector

China Eximbank provides $6.4 million export seller's credit to CWE for Volta Lake Resettlement Township Electrification Sub-Project of the Upper West Electrification Project (linked to #1243)

# Description
On March 2, 2000, the Government of Ghana signed a supplier credit agreement worth approximately $29.5 million with China International Water & Electric Corporation (CWE) for the Volta Lake Resettlement Township Electrification Sub-Project of the Upper West Electrification Project. The CWE supplier credit was provided through an RMB-denominated tranche (RMB 162 million) and a USD-denominated tranche ($6.4 million). Both tranches carried the following terms: 2% interest rate, 10 year maturity, and a 3 year grace period. This project entry captures the USD-denominated loan and project #1243 captures the RMB-denominated loan. The proceeds from both loan tranches were used to finance the extension of electricity to 106 townships (in Brong Ahafo Region, Eastern Region, Northern Region, and Volta Region) under the Volta Lake Resettlement Scheme.   In order to finance its supplier credit agreement with the Government of Ghana, CWE secured an export seller’s credit on September 8, 2000 from China Eximbank with an 11 year maturity. The loan terms captured in this project entry, however, are those of the supplier credit from CWE to Ghana.  Feasibility studies identified a total of 171 townships along the Volta Lake to benefit from the project, but due to the large number of towns involved, the project was carried out in phases. The first phase, which involved the electrification of 106 townships, had an estimated total cost of $32.8 million. CWE provided $29.5 million, covering approximately 90 percent of the total cost. The Government of Ghana was required to contribute the remaining 10% ($2.8 million dollars) as counterpart funding. CWE was the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction began in 2002 and ended in 203. However, the precise project completion date is unknown.

1. The Chinese project title is 的沃尔特湖移民村镇电气化项目. 2. Some media sources indicate that Ghana’s Parliament approved the supplier credit agreement in December 1999 rather than March 2000. However, the Government of Ghana’s Controller & Accountant General's Department records the loan commitment year as 2000.3.  In the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020, it records a maturity of 11 years for this supplier credit but does not record an interest rate or grace period. AidData records the maturity (10 years), interest rate (2%), and grace period (3 years) reported at the time that Ghana’s Parliament approved the supplier credit. The 11-year maturity recorded by SAIS-CARI appears to refer to the term of the export seller’s credit that CWE secured from China Eximbank rather than the term of the supplier credit that CWE provided to the Government of Ghana."

CDB loans to China-Africa Cotton Mozambique Limited for Subué Cotton Processing Plant Project (Linked to #65901)

# Description
In 2013, China Development Bank provided a loan to China-Africa Cotton Mozambique Limited (中非棉业莫桑比克有限公司) — a project company and special purpose vehicle — for the Subué Cotton Processing Plant Project. The face value of the loan and the borrowing terms are unknown.   This project involved construction of a cotton processing plant (ginnery) in Subué posto (locality) within Sofala Province. Upon completion, it was expected that the plant would have the capacity to process 30,000 tons of raw cotton and 3,000 liters of cooking oil each year. A foundation-laying ceremony for the plant took place in May 2013. China-Africa Cotton Mozambique Limited, which is also known as CACM, is now one of the three largest cutting planting and processing enterprises in Mozambique. It provides approximately 1,000 jobs each year and supports as many as 50,000 households involved in cotton cultivate activities.   According to the CDB in 2018, since 2011, CDB has provided 9 cotton purchase loans to China Africa Cotton Development Co., Ltd. for a total of $125 million, which is mainly used to import cotton lint from Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, Mali, and Mauritius as part of a The Cotton Planting and Purchasing Project, the largest agriculture investment project in Africa (#65901). This project is likely funded under one of these 9 cotton purchase loans.

# Title
China Eximbank provides $49.12 million preferential buyer’s credit for Erdenet Thermal Power Plant 35 MW Generator Installation Project (Linked to Project ID#49148)

# Description
On November 10, 2015, China Eximbank and the Government of Mongolia signed a general loan agreement regarding the utilization of a $1 billion preferential buyer's credit (PBC) loan for various projects (captured via Umbrella Project ID#49148). Under the terms of the general loan agreement, all subsidiary (individual) loan agreements for specific projects carry identical borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0% management fee, and a 0.25% commitment fee. Then, on April 9, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Mongolia signed a subsidiary PBC agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC 2018 (13) TOTAL NO. (470)] worth $49,120,000 for the 35MW Erdenet Thermal Power Plant Expansion Project. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 95% of the cost of a $51.8 million commercial (EPC) contract between Mongolia’s Ministry of Energy, China Energy Engineering Group Hunan Power Construction Co., Ltd, and Hunan Industrial Equipment Installation Co., Limited, which was signed on January 17, 2017.  The remaining 5% of the commercial contract cost was to be directly funded by the Government of Mongolia.   The purpose of the project was to expand the Erdenet Thermal Power Plant (Эрдэнэт ДЦС or Эрдэнэтская ТЭЦ or Эрдэнэтийн дулааны цахилгаан станцын) by installing a 35MW turbine generator with a CC-50 engine, refurbishing chemical and water purification facilities, constructing a water-cooling tower, and building a 110 kV overhead transmission line (measuring 3 km in length) and substation. This power plant is located in Erdenet, capital of Mongolia's northern province of Orkhon. Upon completion, this project was expected to increase the power plant's electricity production two-fold (from 36MW to 71MW).   A groundbreaking ceremony took place on March 22, 2019 and construction originally expected to conclude by the end of 2019. However, a project completion and power plant commissioning ceremony did not take place until September 3, 2021.

73204,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",Chinese company consortium provide $870.1 million interest-free loan for Phase 1 and Phase 2 of Sicomines Copper and Cobalt Mining Project (Linked to Project ID#450 and #73145),"On September 17, 2007, a consortium consisting of China Eximbank, China Railways Construction Company (CREC), and Sinohydro and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo signed a “protocol d’accord” (or “项目换资源协议”). According to the terms of the agreement, CREC and Sinohydro would be granted a 68 percent stake in a new joint venture (JV) named the Sino–Congolais des Mines (Sicomines SARL), and a Congolese parastatal called Générale des Carrières et des Mine SARL (Gécamines SARL) would own the other 32 percent. In exchange, the CREC and Sinohydro would provide the Government of the DRC with turnkey public infrastructure projects (worth $6.56 billion) financed by China Eximbank. The terms of lending were not identified in the “protocol d’accord”.  Then, on April 22, 2008, a “convention de collaboration” (Chinese name: 关于刚果民主共和国矿业开发和基础设施建设的合作协议) was signed by the Government of the DRC and Sinohydro (on behalf of Sicomines). It specified that two tranches of infrastructure financing—reportedly worth $3 billion each—would be disbursed and that subsidiary loans approved under the first tranche and second tranche would carry the following terms: a 25-year maturity and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 100 basis points (or 3.839% at the time of the agreement). The proceeds from these loans would be disbursed to the Chinese contractors responsible for individual infrastructure projects.  The April 2008 agreement specified that ownership of the Sicomines joint venture was allocated such that CREC holds 43% ownership of the joint venture, Sinohydro holds 25%, Gécamines holds 20%, and a Mr. Gilbert Kalam Babanika (who was eventually appointed as deputy head of Sicomines) holds 12%. On June 28, 2008, an amendment to the agreement was signed, which change the ownership allocation to CREC: 28%, Sinohydro: 20%, China Metallurgical Group Corporation: 20%, Gécamines: 20%, Mr. Gilbert Kalam Babanika: 12%. On September 11, 2008, a second amendment was signed, which further changed the ownership allocation to CREC: 33%, Sinohydro: 30%, Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt: 5%, Gécamines: 20%, Mr. Gilbert Kalam Babanika: 12%.  Project ID#450 provides a list of the infrastructure projects and subsidiary loans that have been approved to date. Additionally, as part of the April 22, 2008 “convention de collaboration,” it was reported that the Chinese company consortium were to provide 2.9 billion USD in loans to cover 1) 32 million USD loan to Gécamines to cover its initial capital injection to Sicomines (the total registered capital of Sicomines in 2008 was 100 million USD); 2) 50 million USD loan to Gécamines to procure supplies; and 3) to provide a shareholder loan for the development of the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi.  The $2.9 billion was financed by a $870.1 million, interest-free shareholder loan (prêt d’actionnaire) from China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), Sinohydro Corporation and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, and a $2.0299 billion loan from China Eximbank at a fixed interest rate of 6.1%. Project ID#73204 captures the interest-free shareholder loan from China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), Sinohydro Corporation and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt. Project ID#73145 captures the loan from China Eximbank. At the end of Fiscal Year 2013, Sino–Congolais des Mines (Sicomines SARL) disclosed that it had received loan disbursements worth $423,889,454. However, it did not disclose if these disbursements came from the China Eximbank loan, the interest-free shareholder loan (prêt d’actionnaire) from China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC) and Sinohydro Corporation, or both loans. CREC likely provided 422 million USD in interest-free loans, Sinohydro provided 383.7 million USD in interest-free loans, and Zhejiang Youhua provided 64.4 million USD in interest-free loans.   The Congolese government agreed to provide a sovereign guarantee for both the infrastructure loan and the mining loan from China Eximbank. Another unique feature of the April 22, 2008 agreement was the inclusion of a $350 million signing bonus from the consortium of Chinese firms. However, following pressure from the IMF and civil society, an amendment (Avenant No. 3 à la Convention de Collaboration Relative au Developpement d’un Projet Minier et d’un Projet d’Infrastructures en République Démocratique du Congo du 22 Avril 2008) was made to the “convention de collaboration” in October 2009. It reduced size of the infrastructure loan from $6 billion to $3 billion and removed the sovereign guarantee for the copper and cobalt mining loan from China Eximbank.  The sovereign guarantee for the infrastructure loan was left in place. China Eximbank was not a party to this amended agreement, which specified that if the floating (market) interest rate on the infrastructure loan (LIBOR plus 100 basis points) rose higher than the rate (4.4%) referenced in the April 22, 2008 “convention de collaboration”, an expanded consortium of Chinese firms (CREC, Sinohydro, and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Company Ltd) would assume responsibility for the additional interest payments. The profits from the investment by SICOMINES SARL in the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi would be used to repay the loans that finance the costs of developing the copper and cobalt mine and the unrelated infrastructure projects. However, nearly four years after the October 2009 amendment was signed, the Congolese parliament had still not ratified it and China Eximbank became concerned about the risk of non-repayment. In order to limit its risk exposure, China Eximbank suggested that it take over Gécamines’ 32 percent ownership stake and that the Chinese consortium’s 68 percent ownership stake be mortgaged until the infrastructure and mining loans were repaid. The Congolese government rejected these proposed changes, and China Eximbank responded by rescinding its funding in early 2012. Then, the Chinese firms began negotiating with two alternative financiers: China Development Bank and the Bank of China. In July 2013, China Eximbank reversed its decision to halt funding for development of a copper and cobalt mine in Kolwezi. Construction of the mine began in April 2013, and on November 6, 2015 the first phase of the mining project was completed. The second phase commenced on May 21, 2020. As of July 2021, the second phase of the project had successfully produced its first batch of cathode copper. The main copper system has been completed.","1.

85,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides $70 million government concessional loan for 160MW Grand Poubara Hydroelectric Dam Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#73173),"On May 24, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Gabon signed an RMB-denominated government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth $70 million for the 160MW Grand Poubara Hydroelectric Dam Construction Project. The agreement was signed by Gabonese Finance Minister Paul Toungui and China's ambassador Hxue Jinwei. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 3% interest rate.  Also, on May 24, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Gabon also signed a USD-denominated preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement worth $300 million for the 160MW Grand Poubara Hydroelectric Dam Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. The proceeds from the GCL and the PBC were used to finance approximately $370 million of a $398 million Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contract with Sinohydro. The Government of Gabon covered the remaining $28 million cost of the EPC contract.  The Government of Gabon also issued sovereign guarantees for the two loans from China Eximbank.  Project ID#85 captures the GCL, while Project ID#73173 captures the PBC.   The project involved the construction of a dam on the Ogooué river with 4 Francis turbines capable of generating 160 MW. The dam was built in part to generate power for an iron ore mine in Belinga (see Project ID#630).  The project also involved the construction of two power transmission lines: a 15 km line from the dam site to Franceville, the country's third largest city, and another line from the dam site to Moanda (the largest manganese mining region in Gabon and in the world).  The dam is located 15 km outside of Franceville in the province of Haut-Ogooué, more than 700 km southwest of Libreville, an area where the Compagnie minière de l’Ogooué’s (COMILOG) main manganese mine is located.   Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction officially began on November 15, 2008, and it was originally anticipated that the construction process will be completed in 54 months (May 15, 2013).   The dam was impounded on April 30, 2013.  Then, the four power generating units went into operation on August 5, 2013. The dam, water diversion system and other civil works passed final inspection by the project owner on July 22, 2014. The power generator set and auxiliary equipment also passed final inspection by the project owner on August 9, 2014, effectively marking the completion of the project.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loans for the 160MW Grand Poubara Hydroelectric Dam Construction Project  may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In mid-2014, a decline in international oil prices generated sharp reductions in Gabon’s oil exports and fiscal revenues. The country’s rising fiscal deficit led to the accumulation of arrears to external creditors. By 2017, the stock of the Government of Gabon’s external arrears stood at $115 million, including arrears to China, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Israel, and South Korea. All of these arrears were successfully cleared by 2020. However, the Government of Gabon accumulated $3 million of additional arrears to Chinese creditors in 2020.  By the end of May 2021, ‘the stock of [the Government of] Gabon’s external arrears stood at CFAF 98.03 billion (US$182.1 million), including CFAF 23.8 billion (US$44.2 million) vis-à-vis multilaterals and CFAF 21.05 billion (US$39.1 million) vis-à-vis government agencies and private creditors insured with companies from Paris Club member countries and from China [ICBC and China Construction Bank] CFAF 1.3 billion (US$2.42 million). The Government's strategy for the clearance of existing external arrears consists of focusing primarily on multilateral debt, bilateral debt, insured commercial commitments and seeking agreements with other creditors prior to the IMF Board meeting. Accordingly, we will clear the arrears vis-à-vis the multilaterals. We will also clear bilateral and commercial-insured arrears as follows: (i) Austria CFAF 6.83 billion (US$12.69 million); (ii) France CFAF 11.9 billion (US$22.11 million); (iii) Israel CFAF 2.23 billion (US$4.13 million); and Spain CFAF 0.09 billion (US$0.17 million). Regarding the other commercial arrears vis-à-cis AFREXIMBANK (CFAF 7.52 billion or US$13.97 million, and commercial non-insured vis-à-vis France CFAF 0.7 billion (US$1.24 million), Austria CFAF 8.71 billion (US$16.18 million), and Morocco CFAF 1.01 billion (US$1.87 million), we contacted these creditors individually to obtain from them the non-objection agreement. The same communication was made with China to which our bilateral payment arrears are about CFAF 34.01 billion (US$63.17 million).’ Then, in 2022, the IMF reported that the Government of Gabon’s external arrears to Chinese creditors stood at $23.9 million as of December 2021 and $1 million in June 2022.","1.

58761,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides $301 million preferential buyer’s credit for N’djili Airport Terminal Construction Project,"On November 26, 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo signed a $301,098,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the N’djili Airport Terminal Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC are as follows: a 20 year maturity, 7 year grace period, 2% interest rate, and 0.75% commitment fee. The loan is reportedly secured by (collateralized against) revenues that will be generated by an airport tax (called “GoPass”). The borrower is expected to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $354,680,000 commercial (EPC) contract between Régie des Voies Aériennes de la République Démocratique du Congo) (RVA) and Weihai International Economic & Technical Cooperative Co., Ltd. (WIETEC), which was signed on September 16, 2013.     The purpose of the project is to construct a new airport terminal — with an area of ​​40,617 m2 including a ground floor for arrivals — at N'djili International Airport in Kinshasa. The project also involves the installation of check-in counters, arrival and departure baggage rooms, public areas, shopping centers, a foundation, and a parking lot (with the ability to accommodate 1200 vehicles). WIETEC is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation.     A foundation-laying ceremony took place on May 2, 2018. As of May 2020, the DRC’s Minister of Transport Didier Mazengu Mukanzu reported to Parliament that the project’s technical and topographical studies and feasibility studies were 80% complete. By September 2020, the project design process was complete and implementation was expected to start by the end of 2020. As of December 2020, all of the necessary materials and equipment were on-site to begin construction but project implementation had stalled due to the fact that the Congolese Government had not met its counterpart funding commitment. China Eximbank was also withholding loan disbursements. In August 2021, Alphonse Shungu, the Director General of the RVA, reported that the project had only achieved a 9.21% completion rate.   Then, in 2021 and 2021, Qatar Airways Group (QAG) reportedly prepared a major contract for the renovation and management of three strategic airports in the DRC: N'djili International Airport, Ndolo Airport and Lubumbashi Airport. The feasibility studies were entrusted to the Dutch company NACO, which specializes in airport infrastructure. The two parties, who signed a memorandum of understanding in March 2021, agreed on a public-private partnership (PPP) under which QAG would shoulder the cost of renovating and updating the three airports on its own, in exchange for managing it for an unspecified length of time (perhaps as long as thirty years). Under these terms, RVA would no longer manage these airports, depriving it of the bulk of its revenues, especially of the highly controversial ‘go-pass’ tax that travelers have to pay.   Also, as of September 2022, the Congolese Government was reportedly looking to end its partnership with Weihai International Economic & Technical Cooperative (WIETC) for the construction of the new N'djili airport.","1. Some sources refer to this project as the N’djili and Luano Airport Terminals Project, noting that the cost of constructing the new N’djili Airport Terminal is $354,680,000 and the cost of constructing the new Luano Airport Terminal is $201,131,205. It is unclear if China Eximbank or another financier is supporting the construction of the Luano Airport Terminal. This issue warrants further investigation. 2. The World Bank’s Debtor Reporting System (DRS) records $602,196,254 of borrowing by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo from official sector lenders from China in 2019. However, for the time being, AidData only records a single borrowing (for the $301,098,000 PBC for the N’djili Airport Terminal Construction Project) in 2019. This discrepancy merits further investigation. 3. The Chinese project title is 的金沙萨国际机场航站楼项目 or 金沙萨恩吉利国际机场航站楼现代化项目 or 金沙萨恩吉利机场新建航站楼和配套工程.

On November 26, 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo signed a $301,098,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the N’djili Airport Terminal Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC are as follows: a 20 year maturity, 7 year grace period, 2% interest rate, and 0.75% commitment fee. The loan is reportedly secured by (collateralized against) revenues that will be generated by an airport tax (called “GoPass”). The borrower is expected to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $354,680,000 commercial (EPC) contract between Régie des Voies Aériennes de la République Démocratique du Congo) (RVA) and Weihai International Economic & Technical Cooperative Co., Ltd. (WIETEC), which was signed on September 16, 2013.     The purpose of the project is to construct a new airport terminal — with an area of ​​40,617 m2 including a ground floor for arrivals — at N'djili International Airport in Kinshasa. The project also involves the installation of check-in counters, arrival and departure baggage rooms, public areas, shopping centers, a foundation, and a parking lot (with the ability to accommodate 1200 vehicles). WIETEC is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation.     A foundation-laying ceremony took place on May 2, 2018. As of May 2020, the DRC’s Minister of Transport Didier Mazengu Mukanzu reported to Parliament that the project’s technical and topographical studies and feasibility studies were 80% complete. By September 2020, the project design process was complete and implementation was expected to start by the end of 2020. As of December 2020, all of the necessary materials and equipment were on-site to begin construction but project implementation had stalled due to the fact that the Congolese Government had not met its counterpart funding commitment. China Eximbank was also withholding loan disbursements. In August 2021, Alphonse Shungu, the Director General of the RVA, reported that the project had only achieved a 9.21% completion rate.   Then, in 2021 and 2021, Qatar Airways Group (QAG) reportedly prepared a major contract for the renovation and management of three strategic airports in the DRC: N'djili International Airport, Ndolo Airport and Lubumbashi Airport. The feasibility studies were entrusted to the Dutch company NACO, which specializes in airport infrastructure. The two parties, who signed a memorandum of understanding in March 2021, agreed on a public-private partnership (PPP) under which QAG would shoulder the cost of renovating and updating the three airports on its own, in exchange for managing it for an unspecified length of time (perhaps as long as thirty years). Under these terms, RVA would no longer manage these airports, depriving it of the bulk of its revenues, especially of the highly controversial ‘go-pass’ tax that travelers have to pay.   Also, as of September 2022, the Congolese Government was reportedly looking to end its partnership with Weihai International Economic & Technical Cooperative (WIETC) for the construction of the new N'djili airport.

1. Some sources refer to this project as the N’djili and Luano Airport Terminals Project, noting that the cost of constructing the new N’djili Airport Terminal is $354,680,000 and the cost of constructing the new Luano Airport Terminal is $201,131,205. It is unclear if China Eximbank or another financier is supporting the construction of the Luano Airport Terminal. This issue warrants further investigation. 2. The World Bank’s Debtor Reporting System (DRS) records $602,196,254 of borrowing by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo from official sector lenders from China in 2019. However, for the time being, AidData only records a single borrowing (for the $301,098,000 PBC for the N’djili Airport Terminal Construction Project) in 2019. This discrepancy merits further investigation. 3. The Chinese project title is 的金沙萨国际机场航站楼项目 or 金沙萨恩吉利国际机场航站楼现代化项目 or 金沙萨恩吉利机场新建航站楼和配套工程.

63942,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides $211.2 million preferential buyer's credit for New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project,"On October 20, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Philippines signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on financing cooperation. Then, on November 15, 2017, the two parties signed a financing cooperation agreement on the New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project. The Government of Philippines’ National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Investment Coordination Committee approved the project on April 25, 2018. Approximately five months later, on September 21, 2018, the Government of Philippines submitted a loan application to China Eximbank.   Then, on November 20, 2018, China Eximbank and the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) — a government agency in the Philippines that is in charge of water privatization in Metro Manila — signed a $211,214,646.54 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [No.I420I0300202018213220 and CHINA EXIMBANK PBC 2018 NO.25 TOTAL NO.48] for the New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC are as follows: a 20-year maturity period, a 7-year grace period, an interest rate of 2%, a default (penalty) interest rate of 0%, a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee ($633,643.94). The loan effectiveness date was on November 1, 2019, and MWSS paid the entire management fee ($633,643.94) to China Eximbank on November 26, 2019. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a PHP 12,189,893,798.70 commercial (EPC) contract [No.NCWS-KDP 001-2018] between MWSS and China Energy Engineering Corporation Limited (CEEC).   The purpose of the project is to construct the Kaliwa Dam, including intake facilities and other facilities, and a 57 million cubic meter reservoir. The project involves the construction of a water conveyance tunnel that is expected to supply 2,400 million liters per day of raw water for Metro Manila, thereby reducing dependence on the Angat Dam reservoir. Upon completion, the project is also expected to benefit some 17.46 million people or about 3.49 million households of Metro Manila, Rizal, and Quezon. The Kaliwa dam is located in the municipalities of General Nakar and Infanta in Quezon Province and the municipality of Teresa in Rizal Province.   CEEC is the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. EDCOP, PRIMEX, and SMEC are also involved in the project as subcontractors. An environmental compliance certificate (ECC) [No. ECC-CO-1907-0017] for the project was issued by the Government of the Philippines’ Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) on October 11, 2019. But DENR Undersecretary Benny Antiporda was quoted as saying that “the ECC was issued because it was a priority project of the government and the agency had no recourse but to approve it.” A notice to proceed was issued to the EPC contractor on November 13, 2019.   By May 2020, there were only a few more kilometers of access road (to the planned reservoir in General Nakar town in Quezon) left to construct to reach the main dam site. As of December 31, 2020, the project had achieved a 2.48% completion rate. As of March 2021, it had achieved a 9.44% completion rate. Then, on June 29, 2021, a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place.    A June 2021 report quoted MWSS as saying that tunnel excavation for the Kaliwa Dam would be ready to begin in December 2021, with the planned arrival of the tunnel boring machine to the Port of Manila slated for July 2021. Construction continued throughout 2021, despite the fact that the project did not have permits from the appropriate government agencies, opened up the possibility that the ECC issued for the project would be revoked. According to the Commission on Audit (COA), MWSS and CEEC must first comply with the requirements of the National Integrated Protected Areas Systems Act and have a certification issued by the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples. It must also identify disposal sites of excavated materials, among others. If these requirements are not met, the COA has warned that the ECC may be cancelled, which would jeopardize the loan agreement with China Eximbank and the commercial contract with CEEC. The project has generated a great deal of local criticism, with some people warning that the dam could destroy the ecosystems and habitats of indigenous people in several Quezon province towns.   After granting the project’s ECC, the Government of the Philippines downplayed the threat of a sizable flood occurring in the case of structural damage to the dam caused by an earthquake. Public officials claimed that there are no active faults near the dam. The New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project also threatens to displace up to 10,000 members of the Dumagat-Remontado indigenous people group who live in the project area. These Dumagat communities depend on farming for a majority of their income as well as working for Sierra Madre hikers. The loss of their farmland leaves their economic future uncertain. The project site is also the location of sites sacred to the Dumagat people. The Government of the Philippines claims that only 46 families stand to be affected by the project.   In March 2019, Marcelino Tena, President of Samahan ng mga Katutubong Agta-Dumagat-Remontado na Binabaka at Ipinagtatanggol ang Lupaing Ninuno (SAGIBIN-LN), alleged that MWSS “did not follow the right process to secure the Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC),” adding that the engineering design had not been shown to them. In contrast, then-MWSS administrator Reynaldo Velasco claimed that only about 46 families would be affected, that several consultations with those who would be affected had been made, and that the project design had yet to be finalized. The controversy led to the creation of the “STOP Kaliwa Dam” (SKD) organization. Also known as Sectors and Peoples Totally Opposed to Kaliwa Dam, the organization claims representation from indigenous peoples, local communities, church leaders, academics, environmentalists, and social movements. The group has started a signature campaign from all over the Philippines to petition Duterte to stop the project.   By September 2019, the official MWSS website reported that three successful public hearings initiated by DENR-EMB and the MWSS had been conducted, as follows: at General Nakar, Quezon on August 23, 2019, at Teresa, Rizal on August 27, 2019; and at Infanta, Quezon on August 28, 2019. In connection with the free, prior, and informed consent, the site has this to say: “With regard to MWSS’ compliance with Republic Act No. 8173 or the Indigenous People’s Rights Acts, the MWSS through the National Commission of Indigenous Peoples has successfully completed the community assemblies on the six (6) clusters of IP communities in Quezon Province as part of the Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) process (emphasis supplied).” However, according to Mavic Conde, five out of six cluster communities in General Nakar—one of the two municipalities in Quezon province where the NCWS-KDP will be located (the other one is Infanta)— voted overwhelmingly no, effectively rejecting the project. The five clusters consist of those in Lumutan, Baybay, Pasanghan, Umiray, and Cablao.   Also, Aaron Pedrosa, attorney for the progressive political party Sanlakas, alleged that MWSS failed to provide proof of compliance with the procedural requirement of posting a public notice and a copy of the scoping report as proof that public scoping was conducted in the area as part of the environmental impact study. These allegations and counter-allegations have given rise to serious legal questions relating to the issuance of the ECC in the absence of a valid consultation process.","1. This project is also known as the NCWS Project, the NCWS-KDP Project and the Kaliwa Dam Project. The Chinese project title is 卡利瓦大坝 or 卡利瓦大坝项目. 2. The commitment fee is to be paid semi-annually during the availability period, and the management fee is to be paid as a lump-sum within 30 days of the PBC agreement becoming effective. 3. The Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System was previously known as the National Waterworks and Sewerage System Authority.4. In the China’s Overseas Development Finance Dataset that Boston University's Global Development Policy Center published in December 2020, it identifies the loan commitment year as 2017 (rather than 2018) and the face value of the loan as $231 million (rather than $211,214,646,54). AidData relies upon the loan commitment year and face value of the loan that is reported in the loan agreement itself.  5. NEDA’s assessment of the project in 2013 found that the standalone Kaliwa Dam would be barely viable based on its estimated economic internal rate of return (and that the integrated Laiban and Kaliwa Dam system would not be viable without water treatment plants). On the other hand, a 2012 World Bank assessment, which considered probable leakage rates as well as environmental assessment and watershed maintenance costs, singled out the Kaliwa Dam project as offering the lowest financial internal rate of return out of ten potential Metro Manila water projects. A 2021 scholarly assessment of the economic viability of the dam suggest it may become a “white elephant” project, economically burdensome to the host country. 6. The New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project (NCWS-KDP) has been on and off the government’s major infrastructure list since the 1970s. Its development stalled primarily because of environmental and socio-cultural issues relating to the planned construction. The project was first conceptualized under then-President Ferdinand Marcos but was overtaken by events with his departure in February 1986. However, the MWSS Board of Trustees decided to temporarily defer the Laiban Dam Project in December 1989 to accommodate equally important water supply projects which were determined to be urgent at that time. Technical studies about the construction of a dam in Laiban continued under the administration of President Fidel Ramos starting in 1992.  By 2007, the administration of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo had secured a loan from China to fund the project. However, a political scandal involving a Chinese firm marred the administration and caused the project to be shelved. In 2009, San Miguel Corporation, a private company, submitted an unsolicited proposal for the construction of a massive Laiban Dam with a correspondingly large reservoir slated to flood some 28,000 hectares of forest. The proposal was eventually set aside with growing public concerns that the project would increase water rates and displace indigenous people; MWSS subsequently terminated the joint-venture talks for the project.  Some years later, the project was resuscitated as the New Centennial Water Source project (NCWS) with a proposal for two dams in the Kaliwa watershed: a main Laiban Dam and a regulating Kaliwa Low Dam. Concerns about the duration and construction costs led officials to consider building them in stages under different financial schemes. Choosing this option, NEDA approved the implementation of the Kaliwa Low Dam as the first stage in 2014.  Discussions about the Kaliwa Dam resurfaced in March 2019 when parts of Metro Manila experienced significant water service interruptions lasting up to 19 hours per day.7. The Kaliwa River watershed is part of the Sierra Madre Biodiversity Corridor (SMBC). The dam is to be built within the Kaliwa River area declared as a forest reserve under Proclamation No. 573 issued in 1969. Furthermore, Proclamation No. 1636 issued in 1977 demarcated other areas to be affected by the construction as a national park, wildlife sanctuary, and a game preserve. The project’s location in protected and ecological important areas is the main driver of concerns about its impact on biodiversity.  According to the 2018 report of the Haribon Foundation—an organization founded in 1972 committed to “nature conservation through community empowerment and scientific excellence”— the construction of the multi-billion-peso Kaliwa Dam Project will not only have devastating effects on people’s lives, but it will also ravage the homes of thousands of threatened wildlife species in the Sierra Madre mountain forests. The same report states that the dam area declared as a wildlife sanctuary is a “key habitat to 15 species of amphibians, 334 bird species, 1476 fish species, 963 invertebrate species, 81 mammal species, 50 plant species, and 60 reptile species,” according to the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool curated by BirdLife International, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and the United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre. Of the species, a significant number are considered globally threatened by the IUCN, including the critically-endangered Philippine Eagle and the Hawksbill Turtle.8.

57251,ENERGY,"Chinese Government provides KMF 200 million grant for Electricity Generator Installation Project (Linked to Project ID#57255, #57412, #73535)","In 2010, China’s Ministry of Commerce provided a grant to the Government of Comoros for the Electricity Generator Acquisition Project. The monetary value of this grant commitment is unknown.   The project involved the provision of eight electricity generators with 10.6MW of power generation capacity: 4 generators (with 6MW of power generation capacity) for the Voidjou (Vwadju) power plant on the island of Ngazidja (Grande Comore); 1 generator (with (with 3MW of power generation capacity) for the Wemani power plant in city of Fomboni on the island of Mohéli (Mwali); and 2 generators (with 3MW of power generation capacity) for the Trenani power plant on the island of Ndzuani (Anjouan).   The generators were successfully handed over to the Comorian authorities on August 5, 2010. The Chinese Government asked the Government of Comoros to pay for the cost of installing these generators, but they were unable to do so, which led to major delays in generator installation and use. China’s Ministry of Commerce subsequently agreed to provide a grant worth 200 million Comorian francs for the installation of the generators (through the so-called 'Electricity Generator Installation Project').   A contract with China Shenyang International Economic & Technical Cooperation corporation (CSYIC) was signed on September 29, 2012 to facilitate the implementation of the China Shenyang International Economic & Technical Cooperation Corporation (CSYIC). These generators were all successfully installed; however, the power plants where they were installed did not go into use until several years later.

Chinese Government provides KMF 200 million grant for Electricity Generator Installation Project (Linked to Project ID#57255, #57412, #73535)

# Description
In 2010, China’s Ministry of Commerce provided a grant to the Government of Comoros for the Electricity Generator Acquisition Project. The monetary value of this grant commitment is unknown.   The project involved the provision of eight electricity generators with 10.6MW of power generation capacity: 4 generators (with 6MW of power generation capacity) for the Voidjou (Vwadju) power plant on the island of Ngazidja (Grande Comore); 1 generator (with (with 3MW of power generation capacity) for the Wemani power plant in city of Fomboni on the island of Mohéli (Mwali); and 2 generators (with 3MW of power generation capacity) for the Trenani power plant on the island of Ndzuani (Anjouan).   The generators were successfully handed over to the Comorian authorities on August 5, 2010. The Chinese Government asked the Government of Comoros to pay for the cost of installing these generators, but they were unable to do so, which led to major delays in generator installation and use. China’s Ministry of Commerce subsequently agreed to provide a grant worth 200 million Comorian francs for the installation of the generators (through the so-called 'Electricity Generator Installation Project').   A contract with China Shenyang International Economic & Technical Cooperation corporation (CSYIC) was signed on September 29, 2012 to facilitate the implementation of the China Shenyang International Economic & Technical Cooperation Corporation (CSYIC). These generators were all successfully installed; however, the power plants where they were installed did not go into use until several years later. The Voidjou (Vwadju) power plant, Trenani power plant, and Wemani power plant were officially inaugurated on February 5, 2017, April 20, 2017, and May 4, 2017, respectively.

The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance a $321 million commercial (EPC) contract between Électricité du Laos (EDL) — the state corporation of Laos that owns and operates the country's electricity generation, electricity transmission and electricity distribution assets — and China Gezhouba Group Company Limited (CGGC), which was signed on October 13, 2016.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 237-kilometer 500kV high-voltage transmission lines (measuring 237 km in length) and two 230kv substations in Champasak, Attapeu, Saravan, and Sekong provinces. Ultimately, the project sought to connect the power grids in the southern and central regions of Laos, improve the supply and stability of power to the southern region, and increase the export of electricity to earn foreign exchange.   China Energy Construction Guangxi Institute was the contractor responsible for project design. CGGC was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Project implementation commenced on January 12, 2018. On October 7, 2019, the 230 kV Banha Substation which is part of the project, was put into operation.

# Title
China Eximbank provides $321 million government concessional loan for Banha-Sekong Power Transmission Project

# Description
On May 16, 2017, China Eximbank and the Ministry of Finance of Laos signed a $321 million government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Banha-Sekong Power Transmission Project. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance a $321 million commercial (EPC) contract between Électricité du Laos (EDL) — the state corporation of Laos that owns and operates the country's electricity generation, electricity transmission and electricity distribution assets — and China Gezhouba Group Company Limited (CGGC), which was signed on October 13, 2016.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 237-kilometer 500kV high-voltage transmission lines (measuring 237 km in length) and two 230kv substations in Champasak, Attapeu, Saravan, and Sekong provinces. Ultimately, the project sought to connect the power grids in the southern and central regions of Laos, improve the supply and stability of power to the southern region, and increase the export of electricity to earn foreign exchange.   China Energy Construction Guangxi Institute was the contractor responsible for project design. CGGC was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Project implementation commenced on January 12, 2018. On October 7, 2019, the 230 kV Banha Substation which is part of the project, was put into operation. Then, on November 1, 2020, a 18.573 km 500Kv double-circuit transmission line from Banha substation to the Cambodian border was completed.

89473,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,"Sinohydro provides $46.8 million — via deferred payment agreement — for Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads (Phase 1, Lot 7) Project (Linked to Project ID#60154)","On May 16, 2018, the Government of Ghana signed a master project support agreement (MPSA) with Sinohydro Corporation Limited (‘Sinohydro’) for an amount of up to $2 billion for the construction of priority infrastructure projects. The MPSA was then approved by Ghana’s Parliament on July 28, 2018. All borrowings that take place under the MPSA carry a maturity of 15 years, a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.80% margin, a 2% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.70% management fee, a 0.50% commitment fee, and a lump sum Sinosure insurance premium of 7%. Loan repayments will be made with the proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite (after the Government of Ghana establishes a bauxite processing plant), with repayments starting approximately three years after the effective date of the agreement. The proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite will be placed in an offshore escrow account by the offtaker for the benefit of Ghana Integrated Aluminium Development Corporation (GIADC) and Sinohydro.    If the value of bauxite decreases, or if bauxite reserves are lower than expected, the Government of Ghana may have to deliver higher volumes of bauxite than anticipated or find alternative means of repayment. While the Government of Ghana does not currently treat borrowings (via deferred payment agreements or DPAs) under the Sinohydro MPSA as external debt, depending on various factors and events and as a result of the deferred payment structure, they could in the future become repayment obligations of the Government of Ghana. The agreement structure seeks to ensure that the obligations of GIADC (the obligor) will not add to the Government of Ghana’s debt stock. If GIADC fails to comply with its collateral or repayment obligations, Sinohydro is entitled to prepayment of outstanding loan balances and may seize the full balance of the escrow account.   Sinohydro, which is itself borrowing from China Construction Bank to finance infrastructure projects under the MPSA, decided to approve funding for infrastructure projects under the MPSA in phases. The first phase consists of 10 road projects (underpinned by 10 EPC contracts) that are collectively worth $646,637,879.74: Accra Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 1 Project), Kumasi Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 2 Project), Tamale Interchange Project (or Phase 1, Lot 3 Project), PTC Interchange Takoradi Project (or Phase 1, Lot 4 Project and the PTC Roundabout Interchange Project, Takoradi), Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway Project (or Phase 1, Lot 5 Project and the Construction of 14 km Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway Project), Sunyani Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 6 Project), Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 7 Project), Upgrading of Selected Feeder Roads in Ashanti and Western Region Project (or Phase 1, Lot 8 Project, Rehabilitation of Oda Ofoase-Abirem Road Project (or Phase 1, Lot 9 Project and 38 km Rehabilitation of New Abirem-Afoasekuma-Akim Oda Road project), and Hohoe-Jasikan-Dodi Pepesu Road Project (or Phase 1, Lot 10 Project and 56.40 km Construction of Hohoe-Jasikan-Dodo Pepesu Road Project).    Each of these projects is being financed through a separate DPA. Under the terms of the MPSA, 'deferred payments' refer to payments due to Sinohydro under a given EPC contract to be made by Ghana's Ministry of Finance using the proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite that have been deferred up to the repayment dates stipulated in the repayment schedules of the DPAs. The DPA for the Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads (Phase 1, Lot 7) Project was signed by Ghana’s Ministry of Roads and Highways, Ghana’s Ministry of Finance, and Sinohydro on September 1, 2018. Under this DPA, which is captured via Project ID#89473, Sinohydro provided $46,852,015.86 of financing to cover 85% of the total cost of the EPC contract ($35,817,641.64) plus the cost of accrued interest and fees during the 30-month construction period.    The scope of the Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads (Phase 1, Lot 7) Project covers construction of the roads in the Western Region and Central Region (specifically, Cape Coast and Prestea inner city roads). The project, which was originally expected to be completed within a period of 30 months, involves 22 km of Cape Coast roads, 3 km of Akotokyir Area roads, 7 km of Abura New Community Area Roads, 3 km of Polytechnic Area Roads, 3 km of Apawusika Roads and Links, and 10.19 km of Prestea Town Roads. More specifically, the project supported Amamoma Road Bypass, Amamoma Road 1, Amamoma Road 2, ATL Road, Ogua Hall Road, Amamoma Road 3, Kwaprow Link Road, Akotokyir Anglican School Road, Akotokyir Town Road, Akotokyir Road 3, Kakumdo Road, Cape Coast Polytechnic Road, Amissano Road, PPAG Road, Methodist Mission House Road, PPAG Loop, Chrisnam School Road. Ecole Francaise Road, Eyifua Road, Eyifua Link, English Arabic Road, Methodist Mission Link, GHA Road,, Academy Street, Wesley Girl's Link, and Prestea Hunni Valley Town Roads.

# Title
Sinohydro provides $46.8 million — via deferred payment agreement — for Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads (Phase 1, Lot 7) Project (Linked to Project ID#60154)

# Description
On May 16, 2018, the Government of Ghana signed a master project support agreement (MPSA) with Sinohydro Corporation Limited (‘Sinohydro’) for an amount of up to $2 billion for the construction of priority infrastructure projects. The MPSA was then approved by Ghana’s Parliament on July 28, 2018. All borrowings that take place under the MPSA carry a maturity of 15 years, a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.80% margin, a 2% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.70% management fee, a 0.50% commitment fee, and a lump sum Sinosure insurance premium of 7%. Loan repayments will be made with the proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite (after the Government of Ghana establishes a bauxite processing plant), with repayments starting approximately three years after the effective date of the agreement. The proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite will be placed in an offshore escrow account by the offtaker for the benefit of Ghana Integrated Aluminium Development Corporation (GIADC) and Sinohydro.    If the value of bauxite decreases, or if bauxite reserves are lower than expected, the Government of Ghana may have to deliver higher volumes of bauxite than anticipated or find alternative means of repayment. While the Government of Ghana does not currently treat borrowings (via deferred payment agreements or DPAs) under the Sinohydro MPSA as external debt, depending on various factors and events and as a result of the deferred payment structure, they could in the future become repayment obligations of the Government of Ghana. The agreement structure seeks to ensure that the obligations of GIADC (the obligor) will not add to the Government of Ghana’s debt stock. If GIADC fails to comply with its collateral or repayment obligations, Sinohydro is entitled to prepayment of outstanding loan balances and may seize the full balance of the escrow account.   Sinohydro, which is itself borrowing from China Construction Bank to finance infrastructure projects under the MPSA, decided to approve funding for infrastructure projects under the MPSA in phases. The first phase consists of 10 road projects (underpinned by 10 EPC contracts) that are collectively worth $646,637,879.74: Accra Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 1 Project), Kumasi Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 2 Project), Tamale Interchange Project (or Phase 1, Lot 3 Project), PTC Interchange Takoradi Project (or Phase 1, Lot 4 Project and the PTC Roundabout Interchange Project, Takoradi), Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway Project (or Phase 1, Lot 5 Project and the Construction of 14 km Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway Project), Sunyani Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 6 Project), Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 7 Project), Upgrading of Selected Feeder Roads in Ashanti and Western Region Project (or Phase 1, Lot 8 Project, Rehabilitation of Oda Ofoase-Abirem Road Project (or Phase 1, Lot 9 Project and 38 km Rehabilitation of New Abirem-Afoasekuma-Akim Oda Road project), and Hohoe-Jasikan-Dodi Pepesu Road Project (or Phase 1, Lot 10 Project and 56.40 km Construction of Hohoe-Jasikan-Dodo Pepesu Road Project).    Each of these projects is being financed through a separate DPA. Under the terms of the MPSA, 'deferred payments' refer to payments due to Sinohydro under a given EPC contract to be made by Ghana's Ministry of Finance using the proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite that have been deferred up to the repayment dates stipulated in the repayment schedules of the DPAs. The DPA for the Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads (Phase 1, Lot 7) Project was signed by Ghana’s Ministry of Roads and Highways, Ghana’s Ministry of Finance, and Sinohydro on September 1, 2018. Under this DPA, which is captured via Project ID#89473, Sinohydro provided $46,852,015.86 of financing to cover 85% of the total cost of the EPC contract ($35,817,641.64) plus the cost of accrued interest and fees during the 30-month construction period.    The scope of the Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads (Phase 1, Lot 7) Project covers construction of the roads in the Western Region and Central Region (specifically, Cape Coast and Prestea inner city roads). The project, which was originally expected to be completed within a period of 30 months, involves 22 km of Cape Coast roads, 3 km of Akotokyir Area roads, 7 km of Abura New Community Area Roads, 3 km of Polytechnic Area Roads, 3 km of Apawusika Roads and Links, and 10.19 km of Prestea Town Roads. More specifically, the project supported Amamoma Road Bypass, Amamoma Road 1, Amamoma Road 2, ATL Road, Ogua Hall Road, Amamoma Road 3, Kwaprow Link Road, Akotokyir Anglican School Road, Akotokyir Town Road, Akotokyir Road 3, Kakumdo Road, Cape Coast Polytechnic Road, Amissano Road, PPAG Road, Methodist Mission House Road, PPAG Loop, Chrisnam School Road. Ecole Francaise Road, Eyifua Road, Eyifua Link, English Arabic Road, Methodist Mission Link, GHA Road,, Academy Street, Wesley Girl's Link, and Prestea Hunni Valley Town Roads. Sinohydro is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. A formal sod turning ceremony took place on November 21, 2019. However, project implementation did not commence until December 28, 2019. As of September 2021, the project had achieved an 65% completion rate. The project was ultimately completed on September 27, 2022.

Each bank reportedly contributed $550 million. The lenders for the project are Akbank, Finansbank, Ziraat Bank, Garanti Bank, Halk Bank, Is Bank, VakıfBank, Yapı ve Kredi Bank, Deutsche Bank, Saudi National Commercial Bank, Bank of China and Siemens Bank. The Turkish lenders (Akbank, Finansbank, Ziraat Bank, Garanti Bank, Halk Bank, Is Bank, VakıfBank, Yapı ve Kredi Bank) provided eight-ninths of the total loan amount ($4.405 billion) equally among themselves, while the four foreign lenders (Deutsche Bank, Saudi National Commercial Bank, Bank of China and Siemens Bank) provided the remaining one-ninth of the total loan amount ($550.66 million). The loan maturity length is 15 years and the repayment period ends in 2030. However, all other borrowing terms are unknown. Total investment in the project was $7.3 billion, including $4.956 billion of debt, $1.5 billion of equity, and $800 million from operational revenues.   The Gebze-Orhangazi-Izmir Motorway was a toll motorway project procured by the Turkish General Directorate of Highways under a Build, Operate, and Transfer (BOT) Model and is the largest BOT project in Turkey to date. It involved the construction of a 420 km motorway between Gebze and İzmir with 208 toll booths and a 3000-meter suspension bridge crossing İzmit bay. Upon completion, it was expected that the project would reduce travel times from Istanbul to Izmir from 8-10 hours to 3.5 – 4 hours. The starting point of the motorway is Gebze and it then crosses İzmit bay located between Dilovası and Hersek through a Suspension Bridge measuring 3,000 meters in length. It then extends to Orhangazi and Gemlik and is connected to Bursa Ring Road at the Ovaakça intersection. From the Bursa Ring Road, it continues onward to Balıkesir — starting at the Bursa - Karacabey intersection and continuing through the north of Susurluk. It then continues south from the west of Balıkesir — via the Savaştepe, Soma, Kırkağaç districts — and extends to the west near Turgutlu. It runs in parallel to the İzmir-Uşak state highway and finally connects with the Anadolu Lisesi intersection over the İzmir ring road.  On September 20, 2010, Otoyol Yatırım ve İşletme A.Ş. (which was created on September 20, 2010) signed a 22.33-year concession agreement with the General Directorate of Highways of Turkey to build and operate the Gebze-Orhangazi-İzmir motorway between 2013 and 2035. Then, on October 28, 2010, the ceremony for the start of construction works in Gebze took place in the Dilovasi district of Kocaeli Province. A ceremony for the start of construction works in İzmir was held in Alsancak Cumhuriyet Square on February 27, 2011. Phase 1 of the project — a segment of the motorway that runs from Gebze (Muallimköy) intersection to the Altınova intersection and includes the Osmangazi Suspension Bridge — was opened to traffic on July 1, 2016. Phase 2A of the project — a segment of the motorway that runs from Gemlik Junction to Bursa Caglayan Junction — was completed and opened to traffic on March 12, 2017. Phase 2B of the project — a segment of the motorway that runs from  Kemalpaşa Junction to Saruhanlı Junction 01 — was completed and opened to traffic on December 1, 2018. On August 4, 2019, the entire Istanbul-Izmir motorway was put into operation.","1. This project is also known as the Otoyol 5 Project and the Istanbul-Izmir Motorway Project. The Turkish project title is Gebze-Orhangazi-İzmir (İzmit Körfez Geçişi ve Bağlantı Yolları Dahil) Otoyolu Projesi’nin  or İstanbul – İzmir Otoyolu. Given that four foreign lenders (Deutsche Bank, Saudi National Commercial Bank, Bank of China, and Siemens Bank) provided $550.66 million of total debt financing, AidData assumes for the time being that each of these lenders contributed equal amounts ($137.66 million).

# Description
In 2015, a consortium of 9 banks (including Bank of China) issued $4.956 billion of syndicated debt financing to Otoyol Yatırım ve İşletme A.Ş. — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and a joint venture that is owned by Mak-Yol Insaat (27% equity stake), Ozaltin Insaat (27% equity stake), Nurol Holding AS (27% equity stake), Astaldi (18% equity stake), and Gocay Insaat (1% equity stake) — for the Gebze-Orhangazi-İzmir Highway Project. Each bank reportedly contributed $550 million. The lenders for the project are Akbank, Finansbank, Ziraat Bank, Garanti Bank, Halk Bank, Is Bank, VakıfBank, Yapı ve Kredi Bank, Deutsche Bank, Saudi National Commercial Bank, Bank of China and Siemens Bank. The Turkish lenders (Akbank, Finansbank, Ziraat Bank, Garanti Bank, Halk Bank, Is Bank, VakıfBank, Yapı ve Kredi Bank) provided eight-ninths of the total loan amount ($4.405 billion) equally among themselves, while the four foreign lenders (Deutsche Bank, Saudi National Commercial Bank, Bank of China and Siemens Bank) provided the remaining one-ninth of the total loan amount ($550.66 million). The loan maturity length is 15 years and the repayment period ends in 2030. However, all other borrowing terms are unknown. Total investment in the project was $7.3 billion, including $4.956 billion of debt, $1.5 billion of equity, and $800 million from operational revenues.   The Gebze-Orhangazi-Izmir Motorway was a toll motorway project procured by the Turkish General Directorate of Highways under a Build, Operate, and Transfer (BOT) Model and is the largest BOT project in Turkey to date. It involved the construction of a 420 km motorway between Gebze and İzmir with 208 toll booths and a 3000-meter suspension bridge crossing İzmit bay. Upon completion, it was expected that the project would reduce travel times from Istanbul to Izmir from 8-10 hours to 3.5 – 4 hours. The starting point of the motorway is Gebze and it then crosses İzmit bay located between Dilovası and Hersek through a Suspension Bridge measuring 3,000 meters in length. It then extends to Orhangazi and Gemlik and is connected to Bursa Ring Road at the Ovaakça intersection. From the Bursa Ring Road, it continues onward to Balıkesir — starting at the Bursa - Karacabey intersection and continuing through the north of Susurluk. It then continues south from the west of Balıkesir — via the Savaştepe, Soma, Kırkağaç districts — and extends to the west near Turgutlu. It runs in parallel to the İzmir-Uşak state highway and finally connects with the Anadolu Lisesi intersection over the İzmir ring road.  On September 20, 2010, Otoyol Yatırım ve İşletme A.Ş. (which was created on September 20, 2010) signed a 22.33-year concession agreement with the General Directorate of Highways of Turkey to build and operate the Gebze-Orhangazi-İzmir motorway between 2013 and 2035. Then, on October 28, 2010, the ceremony for the start of construction works in Gebze took place in the Dilovasi district of Kocaeli Province. A ceremony for the start of construction works in İzmir was held in Alsancak Cumhuriyet Square on February 27, 2011. Phase 1 of the project — a segment of the motorway that runs from Gebze (Muallimköy) intersection to the Altınova intersection and includes the Osmangazi Suspension Bridge — was opened to traffic on July 1, 2016. Phase 2A of the project — a segment of the motorway that runs from Gemlik Junction to Bursa Caglayan Junction — was completed and opened to traffic on March 12, 2017. Phase 2B of the project — a segment of the motorway that runs from  Kemalpaşa Junction to Saruhanlı Junction 01 — was completed and opened to traffic on December 1, 2018. On August 4, 2019, the entire Istanbul-Izmir motorway was put into operation.

1. This project is also known as the Otoyol 5 Project and the Istanbul-Izmir Motorway Project. The Turkish project title is Gebze-Orhangazi-İzmir (İzmit Körfez Geçişi ve Bağlantı Yolları Dahil) Otoyolu Projesi’nin  or İstanbul – İzmir Otoyolu. Given that four foreign lenders (Deutsche Bank, Saudi National Commercial Bank, Bank of China, and Siemens Bank) provided $550.66 million of total debt financing, AidData assumes for the time being that each of these lenders contributed equal amounts ($137.66 million). This issue merits further investigation."

Then, on September 20, 2018, the Chinese Government and the Government of Guinea-Bissau signed an implementation agreement for the Bissau-Safim Motorway Project. China’s Ministry of Commerce was the source of funding and it committed $16.5 million in total. The project involves the construction of an 8.2 km highway with six lanes (three in each direction) between the cities of Bissau and Safim. Each lane is to be 3.5 meters wide. The highway is also to include lighting that is powered by photovoltaic energy. During construction, electricity cables and water pipes are to be laid and the highway is to be coated with 11 cm thick bituminous concrete. Upon completion, the highway is expected to reduce the travel times between the two cities by 50%. Construction was originally expected to start after August 2018, when Minister Óscar Barbosa and the Chinese Ambassador to China, Jin Hongjun, discussed the need for implementation of the project. It was originally expected to reach completion within 24 months (August 2020).

67062,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","China Eximbank provides EUR 4.279 billion loan Yamal Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project (euro-denominated tranche) (Linked to Project ID#67064, #67063, #67041, #67040)","On April 11, 2016, China Development Bank (CDB) and China Eximbank signed a syndicated facility (loan) agreement with OAO Yamal LNG (or JSC Yamal LNG or ОАО ""Ямал СПГ"") — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of Russia’s OAO NOVATEK (50.1% ownership stake), France's Total S.A. (20% ownership stake), and China's CNPC (20% ownership stake) and Silk Road Fund (9.9% ownership stake) — for the Yamal Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project. The facility agreement was amended on April 29, 2016. The financing from CDB and China Eximbank is part of the project finance package totaling the equivalent of $18.4 billion.  The total cost of the project is approximately $36 billion and it is being financed with a mix of debt and equity. The project reached financial close with CDB and China Eximbank in June 2016.   CDB issued both euro-denominated and RMB-denominated loans in support of this project. The euro-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67064) was worth EUR 5,057,800,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR (-0.141%, April 2016) plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage. It also carried a maturity of 15.166 years (final maturity date: June 15, 2031), a grace period of 3.66 years, (first repayment date December 15, 2019), a 2% management fee, a 1.5% commitment fee, and a default (penalty) interest rate was 1.5%. The RMB-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67063) was worth RMB 5,286,000,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage (-0.141%, April 2016) and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage. It also carried a maturity of 15.166 years (final maturity date: June 15, 2031), a grace period of 3.66 years, (first repayment date December 15, 2019), a 2% management fee, a 1.5% commitment fee, and a default (penalty) interest rate was 1.5%.   China Eximbank provided both euro-denominated and RMB-denominated loans in support of this project. The euro-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67062) was worth EUR 4,279,700,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR (-0.141%, April 2016) plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage. It also carried a maturity of 15.166 years (final maturity date: June 15, 2031), a grace period of 3.66 years, (first repayment date December 15, 2019), a 2% management fee, a 1.5% commitment fee, and a default (penalty) interest rate was 1.5%. The RMB-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67041) was worth RMB 4,472,500,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage (-0.141%, April 2016) and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage. It also carried a maturity of 15.166 years (final maturity date: June 15, 2031), a grace period of 3.66 years, (first repayment date December 15, 2019), a 2% management fee, a 1.5% commitment fee, and a default (penalty) interest rate was 1.5%.   In July 2016, OAO Yamal LNG withdrew a combined 450 million euros from the euro-dominated facilities of CDB and China Eximbank. The individual amounts withdrawn from each facility are unknown. The Yamal Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project is also being financed with a $3.069 billion loan (with a 15 year maturity) from Sberbank, a $1.023 billion loan (with a 15 year maturity) from Gazprombank, a Sinosure-insured EUR 730 million loan (with a 15 year maturity) from the Silk Road Fund (captured in Project ID#67040), an equity investment worth EUR 1.087 billion from the Silk Road Fund (captured in Project ID#67068), and an equity investment worth $5.513 billion by CNPC (captured in Project ID#67069).   The project involved the construction of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant — with 3 liquefaction trains and an annual production capacity of 16.5 million tons per annum based on the feedstock resources of the South-Tambeyskoye field — located in Sabetta at the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula. In addition to the LNG plant, the project included production at the Yuzhno-Tambeyskoye gas field, and the transport infrastructure, including the Sabetta seaport and airport. The Sabetta port is strategically located on the west bank of the Ob Bay, on the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug (YNAO). Its construction was designed to allow Novatek — Russia's second-largest (private) natural gas producer — to boost its exports to China and other Asian countries to compete with Russia’s number one gas producer Gazprom.   Technip France (France) and JGC Corporation (Japan), acting as one consortium, were the EPC contractors responsible for implementation. They are among the leading international engineering and construction companies with vast experience in front-end engineering design and execution of engineering, procurement and construction contracts for LNG plants worldwide. One of their subcontractors was China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). A groundbreaking ceremony for the Sabetta seaport was held on or around July 23, 2012; however, construction of the seaport did not begin until 2013. Despite the fact that the Russian government does not have an ownership stake in the borrowing institution (JSC Yamal LNG), when the project stalled in 2015 because of Western sanctions on Novatek, the Russian government quietly injected 150 billion rubles (approximately EUR 2.1 billion) into JSC Yamal LNG by tapping its rainy-day fund (the so-called “National Wealth Fund”). The Russian government never provided an explicit justification for the bailout, but Leonid Michelson and Gennady Timchenko are major shareholders of Novatek and personal friends of Vladimir Putin. As of April 2016, construction of the LNG plant was 65% complete. LNG production began on December 5, 2016. Then, on December 8, 2017, the commercial operation of the port and first LNG train (LNG purification facility) were launched by starting loading the first LNG carrier named after the late CEO of Total Christophe de Margerie. The loading was ceremonially launched by president Vladimir Putin in the presence of Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih. Then, in August 2018, the second production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched. In November 2018, the third production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched.   Yamal LNG has commissioned 15 LNG icebreaker/tanker ships to export its gas. Each icebreaker/tanker is designed to operate year-round from the Yamal peninsula and to break ice up to 2.5 meters thick. The ships are leased by Yamal LNG from four companies: Sovcomflot, one ship; MOL, three ships; Dynagas, five ships; and Teekay, six ships.  The tankers were designed in Finland by Aker Arctic Technology Inc. and built at the Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) shipyard in South Korea. The first icebreaker, Christophe de Margerie, traversed from Norway to South Korea across the Northern Sea Route in 19 days in August 2017.  When ice precludes shipping along the Northern Sea Route, then the Fluxys terminal at Zeebrugge, Belgium, will serve Russia as the LNG port for the Asia-Pacific region. Following the September 14, 2019 attack by Iran on Saudi Arabian oil fields at Khurais and Abqaiq (Biqayq in Arabic) during the 2019–2021 Persian Gulf crisis, the United States Government imposed sanctions under executive order 13846 against several companies including Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Seaman and Ship Management Company Ltd and the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian (大連中遠海運油品運輸有限公司) which are two Cosco Shipping Company subsidiaries that are supporting LNG shipments from Sabetta. As of late September 2019, the Joint Venture TC LNG between the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian company (50% stake) and the Canadian firm Teekay is the China LNG Shipping Ltd (CLNG) which has more than one third of Sabetta's LNG ice fleet, six ARC7 LNG tankers: Eduard Toll (Russian: «Эдуард Толль»), Rudolf Samoilovich (Russian: «Рудольф Самойлович»), Nikolay Evgenov (Russian: «Николай Евгенов»), Vladimir Voronin (Russian: «Владимир Воронин») all of which are operating, Georgy Ushakov (Russian: «Георгий Ушаков») which is going to Sabetta after sea trials, and Yakov Gakkel (Russian: «Яков Гаккель») which is under sea trials at a South Korean shipyard. Also affected were five ARC7 tankers which Dynagas will supply in a partnership between Sinotrans&CSC and CLNG (25.5% stake), as well as three ARC7 tankers from a joint venture between the Cosco subsidiary Shanghai LNG and Japan's MOL (株式会社商船三井). However, these former five and later three ARC7 tankers were not directly sanctioned but US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) rules require caution to be exercised in the former. Of the fifteen ARC7 tankers operating out of Sabetta, only Sovcomflot's Christophe de Margerie was not affected by the sanctions. Although these ships had been serviced at Honningsvåg, Norway, this was to be phased out and future LNG tanker shipments along the Northern Sea Route may occur between Murmansk and Kamchatka in Russia coastal waters.  On January 30, 2020, the United States Government lifted sanctions on Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) and its TC LNG.  There are some indications that Yamal LNG Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of its lenders. In February 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued Directive 3 Under Executive Order 14024, which prohibited U.S. persons from engaging in all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of greater than 14 days maturity and new equity issued by 13 Russian state-owned enterprises and entities, as well as their subsidiaries, on or after March 26, 2022. The entities included Transneft, Sberbank, AlfaBank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Rostelecom, RusHydro, Alrosa, Sovcomflot, and Russian Railways. Then, on March 5, 2022, the Russian Government issued Presidential Decree No. 95, which required that Russian borrowers make payments to foreign creditors from ‘unfriendly states’—including most countries that imposed sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine—in Russian rubles (irrespective of the currency of the loan), unless a permission to make direct payments in the contractual currency was granted by either the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) or Russia’s Ministry of Finance. This measure made it substantially more difficult for Russian borrowers to make timely payments on foreign- and local-currency debt to certain international creditors in their original currencies of denomination. In June 2022, the Russian Government defaulted on some of its dollar-denominated and euro-denominated debt.   The fact that at least two of OAO Yamal LNG's lenders (Sberbank and Gazprombank) faced international sanctions in 2022 and 2023 likely complicated loan repayment. Poten & Partners -- a firm that advises clients that are active in the international oil, gas and shipping markets -- noted in March 2022 that that 'latest round of sanctions has left Russian LNG sector companies and the domestic and foreign companies that provide finance and services to them struggling to assess their liabilities and exposure to counterparties. [...] Providers of the approximately [$20 billion] debt package for Yamal LNG included China Exim, CDB, Sberbank, Gazprombank, Russia’s National Wealth Fund (NWF), Russia’s ECA, Exiar, with smaller portions coming from Germany’s Euler Hermes, Sweden’s EKN, Austria’s Raiffeisen, JBIC and Intesa San Paolo. State development bank VEB also provided a US$3Bn guarantee to the project. Some of the Russian entities on the financing, including VEB, NWF and Exiar are now faced with sanctions. Novatek owns a 50.1% stake, with TotalEnergies and CNPC each holding 20% and China’s Silk Road Fund the remaining 9.9%. As the operating Yamal LNG project continues to service its loans, with a core group of lenders in Yamal LNG subject to sanctions, it will complicate arrangements. Parties who have contracts with the project such as shippers, suppliers and contractors are also potentially exposed to sanctions. It puts shareholders in a difficult position over whether to try and replace sanctioned entities. When Novatek and its partners were looking to raise funding for Yamal LNG, Russia’s annexation of Crimea forced them to makeover their financing plan. Financial advisor Societe Generale, and legal advisors White & Case and Latham & Watkins exited the project in 2014 and the financing was reworked to maximise support from Chinese and Russian lenders. It focused on using euros, Russian roubles and Chinese renminbi rather than US dollars to reduce sanctions risks. In its new form, the financing was successful, even though Novatek was subject to limited and defined US sanctions. But with the current round of restrictive measures, conditions are more challenging.'","1. This project is also known as the Sabetta Port Project. The Chinese project title is 亚马尔液化天然气项目.

49955,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides $32 million buyer’s credit loan for 75MW Mone Creek Multipurpose Dam Construction Project,"On November 20, 1998, China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) Technology Co Ltd signed an MoU with Myanmar’s Ministry of Electric Power on equipment supply and servicing for the 75MW Mone Creek Multipurpose Dam Construction Project. Then, on November 8, 2000, Sinohydro Corporation Limited and CITIC signed a $17.5 million contract for the provision of power generation equipment and technical support to the project. China Eximbank reportedly issued a $32 million buyer’s credit loan in support of the project.

China Eximbank provides $32 million buyer’s credit loan for 75MW Mone Creek Multipurpose Dam Construction Project

# Description
On November 20, 1998, China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) Technology Co Ltd signed an MoU with Myanmar’s Ministry of Electric Power on equipment supply and servicing for the 75MW Mone Creek Multipurpose Dam Construction Project. Then, on November 8, 2000, Sinohydro Corporation Limited and CITIC signed a $17.5 million contract for the provision of power generation equipment and technical support to the project. China Eximbank reportedly issued a $32 million buyer’s credit loan in support of the project. The proceeds of this loan were likely used (in part) by the borrower to finance the contract between Sinohydro Corporation Limited and CITIC.  The project involved the construction of a 75MW hydroelectric power plant and dam on the Mone Creek in Sedoktara Township (two miles north of Minbu District, Magway Division).

Among other things, the community wanted water tanks in exchange for quarrying by the Chinese contractor. I noticed that the contractor never objected to any of the community’s demands and promised to [fulfill] them. But to date, they have not done anything to the benefit of the villagers. I think the problem is that we never asked them to sign any document where they committed to anything. It was just a verbal agreement.”   Then, in May 2021, Basotho employees of CNQC went on strike, claiming that their concerns and complaints had gone unanswered. Robert Mokhahlane, Secretary-General of the Construction Mining, Quarrying and Allied Workers Union (CMQ), told a local news outlet that the CNQC workers — who are also members of CMQ — went on strike following two unanswered petitions from the workers union.

He also said that “workers are […] punished for stolen equipment without any proof and investigations on who really stole it. They have their salaries cut without having any word with them, while those Chinese are also stealing from the company themselves.” He also told a local news outlet that that workers’ salaries have a pay-as-you-earn deduction, but the tax collection was not being remitted to Lesotho Revenue Authority by CNQC. He said that “what made us realize this is the fact that workers are never given payslips to know more about their salary details.” He further noted that complaints during the first week after the Easter break when workers demanded to be paid their owed salaries that were never paid from a Covid-19 induced lockdown In January 2021.

88167,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",Bank of China provides loan for TANGO FLNG Project (Linked with Project ID#88165),"On June 23, 2015, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China ltd (ICBC) and Exmar — a Belgian shipping company that specializes in liquefied gas logistics and storage — signed a $198 million export buyer’s credit agreement for the Caribbean Floating LNG (CFLNG) Project (captured via Project ID#88165). The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown.   The purpose of the project was to build and acquire the world's first floating LNG (FLNG) storage facility. The contractors responsible for the construction of this floating LNG storage facility were Wison (Nantong) Heavy Industry Co., Ltd. and Wison Offshore Engineering Co., Ltd. The FLNG ordered by EXMAR was to be the world’s first floating natural gas liquefaction unit. It was expected to have the functions of natural gas processing, liquefaction and storage, and represents the new generation of offshore units. The unit, which was 95% complete as of March 2015, was originally expected to serve as the gas project of Pacific Rubiales Energy, which is the second biggest oil and gas company of Colombia.  However, in March 2016, Exmar and Pacific Exploration & Production (PEP) agreed to terminate a 15-year tolling agreement (liquefaction and storage agreement) because PEP was facing a possible Chapter 11 filing (bankruptcy). Miguel de Potter, Exmar’s CFO, told a media outlet that the contract termination would limit his company’s exposure to a possible bankruptcy filing by PEP. 'Looking at the latest press releases, we have a fair chance to see that they will default on their [loan] covenant and will sometime end up in a Chapter 11 situation. By terminating the contract, we can open up the vessel to other opportunities,' Potter said. In March 2016, Exmar put out a press release, which said that '[s]ince the execution of the tolling agreement, the domestic natural gas market in Colombia and international LNG market have changed substantially making the liquefaction of LNG in Colombia no longer economic for PEP.' During 2016, the export buyer’s credit agreement with ICBC was also cancelled.  Then, on July 27, 2017, Exmar announced that it had taken delivery of the CFLNG from Wison Offshore & Marine in the People’s Republic of China. The CFLNG consists of a 500,000 tons per year floating liquefaction plant with 16,000 m3 of LNG storage and will remain moored in Wison Shipyard. Then, in August 2018, Exmar agreed to deploy CFLNG as a pilot production system for LNG export in Bahía Blanca, Argentina. A contract was signed by Exmar and the Argentinian Oil and Gas Company (YPF S.A.) on November 20, 2018 and the Caribbean FLNG became the Tango FLNG. Site specific modification and reactivation works were carried out in China, where the Tango FLNG unit was laid up. It was loaded onto a semi-submersible heavy lift vessel (HLV) close to Shanghai in December 2018. In parallel, gas treatment and compression equipment was sourced and procured, and modifications to the jetty were completed. The unit arrived in Bahía Blanca in February 2019. After mooring up, commissioning activities were started, ultimately resulting in the successful delivery of a first LNG cargo on June 6, 2019.  Shortly after the cancellation of the ICBC agreement, Exmar entered into negotiations with Bank of China (BoC).

This loan, which was insured by Sinosure, was fully disbursed (drawn down) as of July 27, 2017. The agreement with BoC provides a repayment period of 12 years and the loan bears interest at a rate of six-month LIBOR plus a 3% margin. The yearly estimated debt service amounts to $21.3 million.

Bank of China provides loan for TANGO FLNG Project (Linked with Project ID#88165)

# Description
On June 23, 2015, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China ltd (ICBC) and Exmar — a Belgian shipping company that specializes in liquefied gas logistics and storage — signed a $198 million export buyer’s credit agreement for the Caribbean Floating LNG (CFLNG) Project (captured via Project ID#88165). The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown.   The purpose of the project was to build and acquire the world's first floating LNG (FLNG) storage facility. The contractors responsible for the construction of this floating LNG storage facility were Wison (Nantong) Heavy Industry Co., Ltd. and Wison Offshore Engineering Co., Ltd. The FLNG ordered by EXMAR was to be the world’s first floating natural gas liquefaction unit. It was expected to have the functions of natural gas processing, liquefaction and storage, and represents the new generation of offshore units. The unit, which was 95% complete as of March 2015, was originally expected to serve as the gas project of Pacific Rubiales Energy, which is the second biggest oil and gas company of Colombia.  However, in March 2016, Exmar and Pacific Exploration & Production (PEP) agreed to terminate a 15-year tolling agreement (liquefaction and storage agreement) because PEP was facing a possible Chapter 11 filing (bankruptcy). Miguel de Potter, Exmar’s CFO, told a media outlet that the contract termination would limit his company’s exposure to a possible bankruptcy filing by PEP. 'Looking at the latest press releases, we have a fair chance to see that they will default on their [loan] covenant and will sometime end up in a Chapter 11 situation. By terminating the contract, we can open up the vessel to other opportunities,' Potter said. In March 2016, Exmar put out a press release, which said that '[s]ince the execution of the tolling agreement, the domestic natural gas market in Colombia and international LNG market have changed substantially making the liquefaction of LNG in Colombia no longer economic for PEP.' During 2016, the export buyer’s credit agreement with ICBC was also cancelled.  Then, on July 27, 2017, Exmar announced that it had taken delivery of the CFLNG from Wison Offshore & Marine in the People’s Republic of China. The CFLNG consists of a 500,000 tons per year floating liquefaction plant with 16,000 m3 of LNG storage and will remain moored in Wison Shipyard. Then, in August 2018, Exmar agreed to deploy CFLNG as a pilot production system for LNG export in Bahía Blanca, Argentina. A contract was signed by Exmar and the Argentinian Oil and Gas Company (YPF S.A.) on November 20, 2018 and the Caribbean FLNG became the Tango FLNG. Site specific modification and reactivation works were carried out in China, where the Tango FLNG unit was laid up. It was loaded onto a semi-submersible heavy lift vessel (HLV) close to Shanghai in December 2018. In parallel, gas treatment and compression equipment was sourced and procured, and modifications to the jetty were completed. The unit arrived in Bahía Blanca in February 2019. After mooring up, commissioning activities were started, ultimately resulting in the successful delivery of a first LNG cargo on June 6, 2019.  Shortly after the cancellation of the ICBC agreement, Exmar entered into negotiations with Bank of China (BoC). Following the signature of a term sheet in November 2016 with BoC and the approval of terms by the latter’s credit committees in December 2016 and January 2017, Exmar finalized the documentation required to enable parties to sign the credit agreement.

# Description
On 15 December 2015, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) signed a loan contract with Arias Financial Trust (Fideicomiso Financiero Arias) to finance the Colonia Arias Wind Farm Project, through which the IDB would provide 71,818,000 USD from its ordinary capital (Loan 34543/OC-UR-1, Loan 3453A/OC-UR-2), and the People's Bank of China would provide 35,909,000 USD (Loan 3453/CH-UR-1, 3453/CH-UR-2) via the China Co-Financing Fund for Latin America and the Caribbean (CHC). The IDB would administer an additional B loan of 17,959,000 USD, which would be provided by another commercial bank or financial institution (Loan 3453B/OC-UR-SP-BBAOMAB). The financing package administered by IDB for this project totaled 124,038,670 USD. The total project cost was 180 million USD, with the remaining financing expected to be provided as counterpart financing.  The IDB approval date for this loan financing was 6 May 2015, and it refers to this project as ""UR-L1103 : Colonia Arias Wind Project"".  The ""PROSPECTO INFORMATIVO,"" published only a few days before the loan contract was signed, provided a sample loan contract that identifies loan terms that the final contract ""will be substantially similar to.""

Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility,  carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections. The process was managed by an office in the Angolan Ministry of Finance -- known as Gabinete de Apoio Técnico (GAT) -- that was specifically created to manage the MLFA with China Eximbank.  In February 2005, China Eximbank and the Government of Angola signed a $190,515,690.59 subsidiary buyer’s credit loan agreement under the November 2003 MLFA for the 357 km Quifangondo-Caxito-Uige-Negage Highway Rehabilitation Project (as captured via Project ID#34853).  The proceeds of this loan were used to partially finance a $211,684,100.65 commercial contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), which was signed on February 8, 2005.  Then, on July 19, 2007, China Eximbank entered into another $500 million MLFA with the Government of Angola (captured via Project ID#34030). The MLFA was meant to finance 'complementary actions' to the 2004 MLFA (captured via Project ID#42029).  The 2007 MLFA facility financed a total of 18 contracts, which supported projects originally undertaken through the 2004 MLFA.  ILAs approved through the 2007 MLFA carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee. Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  On July 19, 2007, the Government of Angola also received a supplementary $50,702,850.00 buyer's credit loan from China Eximbank under the July 2007 MLFA for 'complementary actions' related to the 357 km Quifangondo-Caxito-Uige-Negage Highway Rehabilitation Project (as captured via Project ID#66). The proceeds of the loan were used to partially finance a supplementary commercial contract with CRBC worth $56,336,500.00.  The purpose of the project, which employed 1336 Angolan workers and 367 Chinese workers, was the rehabilitation of a 357 km highway between Quifangondo and Negage via Caxito and Uige. The starting point of the road is in the town of Kifangondo, a northern suburb of Luanda City.  It extends northward through the city of Caxito, the capital of Bengo Province and the city of Uige, the capital of Uige Province.  The road terminates in the city of Negage, an important agricultural town within Uige Province.  The contract supporting the project went into effect on December 13, 2005 and the originally expected project handover date was June 30, 2008.  The project officially commenced on December 13, 2005; and a project handover ceremony took place on August 30, 2008.  The project was later inspected on March 8, 2014 by MOFCOM (ECCO) officials.","1. This project is also known as the 371 km Kifangondo-Caxito-Uige-Negage Highway Rehabilitation Project or the 221 Road Project.  The Chinese project title is 安哥拉吉方刚多－卡西托－威热－加吉道路修复项目 or 基凡冈都 --卡希托 -- 威热 -- 内加热公路.2. In July 2020, AidData asked Dr. Lucy Corkin, a leading expert on Chinese lending to Angola, whether the second, third, and fourth master loan facility agreements (MLFAs) that the Angolan Government signed with China Eximbank in 2007 and 2009 were structured as a buyer’s credit loans like the first MLFA that the Angolan Government signed with China Eximbank in 2004.

China Eximbank provides $50.5 million buyer’s credit loan for 357 km Quifangondo-Caxito-Uige-Negage Highway Rehabilitation Project (Linked to Project ID#34030, #34853)

# Description
On November 28, 2003, the Chinese Government and the Angolan Government signed a framework agreement pertaining to a special economic cooperation arrangement (Agreement name in Chinese: 中华人民共和国商务部与安哥拉共和国财政部关于两国经贸合作特殊安排的框架协议).  Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility,  carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections. The process was managed by an office in the Angolan Ministry of Finance -- known as Gabinete de Apoio Técnico (GAT) -- that was specifically created to manage the MLFA with China Eximbank.  In February 2005, China Eximbank and the Government of Angola signed a $190,515,690.59 subsidiary buyer’s credit loan agreement under the November 2003 MLFA for the 357 km Quifangondo-Caxito-Uige-Negage Highway Rehabilitation Project (as captured via Project ID#34853).  The proceeds of this loan were used to partially finance a $211,684,100.65 commercial contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), which was signed on February 8, 2005.  Then, on July 19, 2007, China Eximbank entered into another $500 million MLFA with the Government of Angola (captured via Project ID#34030). The MLFA was meant to finance 'complementary actions' to the 2004 MLFA (captured via Project ID#42029).  The 2007 MLFA facility financed a total of 18 contracts, which supported projects originally undertaken through the 2004 MLFA.  ILAs approved through the 2007 MLFA carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee. Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  On July 19, 2007, the Government of Angola also received a supplementary $50,702,850.00 buyer's credit loan from China Eximbank under the July 2007 MLFA for 'complementary actions' related to the 357 km Quifangondo-Caxito-Uige-Negage Highway Rehabilitation Project (as captured via Project ID#66). The proceeds of the loan were used to partially finance a supplementary commercial contract with CRBC worth $56,336,500.00.  The purpose of the project, which employed 1336 Angolan workers and 367 Chinese workers, was the rehabilitation of a 357 km highway between Quifangondo and Negage via Caxito and Uige. The starting point of the road is in the town of Kifangondo, a northern suburb of Luanda City.  It extends northward through the city of Caxito, the capital of Bengo Province and the city of Uige, the capital of Uige Province.  The road terminates in the city of Negage, an important agricultural town within Uige Province.  The contract supporting the project went into effect on December 13, 2005 and the originally expected project handover date was June 30, 2008.  The project officially commenced on December 13, 2005; and a project handover ceremony took place on August 30, 2008.  The project was later inspected on March 8, 2014 by MOFCOM (ECCO) officials.

The Chinese project title is 安哥拉吉方刚多－卡西托－威热－加吉道路修复项目 or 基凡冈都 --卡希托 -- 威热 -- 内加热公路.2. In July 2020, AidData asked Dr. Lucy Corkin, a leading expert on Chinese lending to Angola, whether the second, third, and fourth master loan facility agreements (MLFAs) that the Angolan Government signed with China Eximbank in 2007 and 2009 were structured as a buyer’s credit loans like the first MLFA that the Angolan Government signed with China Eximbank in 2004. Dr. Corkin noted that the second, third and fourth MLFAs were treated more like ceiling increases to the initial facility. Therefore, for the time being, AidData categorizes the second, third, and fourth MLFAs as buyer's credit loans. 3.

92628,ENERGY,"[CPEC, IPP] China Eximbank contributes to $1.43 billion syndicated loan for 1320MW Thar Block-1 Integrated Coal Mine and Power Project (Linked to Project ID#54013, 92627, 92628)","On April 20, 2015, Shanghai Electric Group Company Limited (SEGCL) and Sino Sindh Resources (Pvt.) Ltd (SSRL or (華信資源有限責任 公司) — a subsidiary of Global Mining (China) that was awarded a 30-year mining lease for Thar Coalfield Block I in October 2011— signed a cooperation framework agreement. Following the signing of this agreement, the two parties sought to establish an arrangement for the supply of coal to satisfy the coal consumption needs of a 1320 MW (2 x 660MW) coal-fired power plant project at Thar Coal Block-1 within Thar District and the Province of Sindh. As part of this deal, SSRL and SEGCL also entered into a coal supply agreement, in which SSRL will extract coal and supply it to China Power International (CPI). The mine is eventually expected to reach 20 million tons per year, which will be used for additional power plants as well as for export. In 2016, Pakistan’s Private Power Infrastructure Board issued a Letter of Intent to SEGCL to set up a 1320 MW supercritical indigenous coal-fired generation facility/thermal power plant at the project site. To facilitate the financing, development and operations of the power plant as well as a 7.8 million tons annual output (7.8 mtpa) coal mine, a special purpose vehicle called Thar Coal Block-1 Power Generation Company (Private) Limited (TCBPGCPL or 塔尔发电公司) was established on January 28, 2016. TCBPGCPL is jointly owned by Shanghai Electric Investment (Dubai) Limited (99.9997% equity stake) and 2 Chinese individuals in equal proportions (0.0003% equity stake). The total cost of the 1320MW Thar Block-1 Integrated Coal Mine and Power Project is $1.9122 billion. It is being implemented as an Independent Power Project — as part of the CPEC initiative — and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25.  On March 6, 2020, TCBPGCPL signed a $1.43 billion syndicated buyer’s credit (loan) agreement with China Development Bank (Project ID#53674), China Eximbank (Project ID#92628), ICBC (Project ID#92627), and Habib Bank for the 1320MW Thar Block-1 Integrated Coal Mine and Power Project. SEGCL/SEPCO agreed to provide $478 million of equity. The borrowing terms of the syndicated loan are unknown. However, it is known that Sinosure provided buyer’s credit insurance. It is also known that TCBPGCPL acquired 232.32 acres of land within the Thar Coalfield Block-I and the Government of Pakistan allowed TCBPGCPL to mortgage the land to its lenders.  The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance two contracts: a $434,750,358 commercial (EPC) contract between Shanghai Electric Engineering Consulting Company Limited（上海電 氣工程設計有限公司) and SSRL, which was signed on April 17, 2019; and a $467,956,549 commercial (EPC) contract between Shanghai Electric Hongkong International Engineering Company Limited（上海電氣香港國際工程有限公司) and SSRL, which was signed on April 17, 2019. Then, on August 27, 2019, TCBPGCPL and Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (Guarantee) Limited (CCP-G) signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). The Government of Pakistan has not only issued a CCP-G payment guarantee but also a 20% return on equity (ROE) guarantee.  The purpose of the project is to construct a 1320 MW supercritical indigenous coal-fired generation facility/thermal power plant and to develop an integrated coal mine with an annual production capacity of 7.8 million tons. The power plant will consist of two, 660 MW supercritical units having supercritical variable pressure operation coal-fired tower type boiler with single furnace, extraction condensing steam turbine and inner-cooled generator. It is envisaged that the power plant will eventually be connected with the 660kV Matiari-Lahore HVDC Transmission Line Project (captured via Project ID#54013). An estimated 600 families will be displaced due to the coal mining and installation of the power plant. The Thar Block-1 covers approximately 122 km2 in the southern part of the Thar coalfield area in the Thar Desert in the Sindh province of Pakistan, approximately 380km east of Karachi. The Thar coalfield area covers approximately 9,000 km2 and is bounded by the Pakistan-India border to the north, east, and south. The 1.3GW coal-fired power plant being developed as part of the integrated project is located approximately 5km away from the pithead of the Thar Block-1 coal mine. Shanghai Electric Engineering Consulting Company Limited and Shanghai Electric Hongkong International Engineering Company Limited are the EPC contractors responsible for implementation.  Mining work on the Thar Coal Block-I mine and plant began in October 2019. Then, in December 2019, the Government of Pakistan’s Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) signed an implementation agreement (IA) with Shanghai Electric for the project. Construction was temporarily suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic. Then, in August 2020, a batch of 500 Chinese workers and managers arrived in Pakistan by a special chartered flight, which accelerated the implementation of the project. In February 2021, almost 40% of work related to coal mining was reportedly completed and construction work was also in progress on the power station. The first unit (660MW) is expected to be operational by August 2022, while the expected commercial operations date (COD) is February 2023. 4,767 people are reportedly being employed by the project (of which 1381 are Chinese and 3386 are Pakistani).","1.

Standard Chartered Bank acted as Mandated Lead Arranger for this transaction. Other roles performed by Standard Chartered Bank includes Structuring Bank, ECA Coordinator, Account Bank, Intercreditor Agent, Hermes Facility Agent, Sinosure Facility Agent, Commercial (MIGA) Facility Agent and Security Agent. The transaction was structured as a long-term loan with a maturity of 15 years and a grace period of 3 years. The loan was scheduled for repayment in 24 semi-annual installments. The loan was split into 3 tranches: a $118.36 million Sinosure-insured loan tranche from Bank of China and Siemens Bank; a $34.03 million Euler Hermes-insured tranche from Deutsche Pfandbriefbank AG, and a $44.34 million commercial tranche insured by MIGA NHSFO from Standard Charted Bank.  The Euler Hermes-insured tranche carried an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 1.8% margin, while the Sinosure-insured tranche carried an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3% margin and the MIGA-insured carried an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 1.8% margin.  The loan had achieved an 81.6% disbursement rate ($160.68 million out of $196.7 million) as of June 30, 2019 and a 97% disbursement rate ($190.87 million out of $196.7 million) as of June 30, 2020.  The Government of Bangladesh provided a sovereign guarantee for debt service. The loan was also secured (collateralized) with a charge on project assets, including accounts, and assignment of project contracts. The syndicated loan covered 80% of the costs of the project, with the other 20% coming from North-West Power Generation Company Limited.  The borrower (NWPGCL) was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract that it signed with a consortium consisting of China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation (CMC) and Fujian Electric Power Survey & Design Institute (FEDI) on July 12, 2015.   The purpose of the project was to construct the third power generation unit (Unit 3) of the 220 MW Sirajganj Combined Cycle Power Plant. More specifically, the project involved the involves the installation of one gas turbine generator (GTG) capable of operating on natural gas and/or High Speed Diesel (HSD), one Gas Booster Compressor, one heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), evaporators, cooling towers, main and by pass stacks connected to a steam turbine Generator (STG) of condensing type for indoor installation, condensate and feed water system, cooling water system and auxiliary equipment.  The project site is located about 15 km south-east of Sirajganj town and 135 km north-west of Dhaka on the western bank of the River Jamuna. It is located in Khas Barashimul Mouza in the Saidabad Union of Sirajganj Sadar Upazilla (sub-district) of Sirajganj District. The closest settlements to the project site, Boroshimul and Ponchosona, are both located approximately 1 km from the complex.   China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC) was the EPC contractor responsible for overall project management. FEDI was responsible for providing technical expertise, including concept design and basic engineering. Under the EPC contract, the contractors were required to commission the project within 2.5 years of the start date. Construction of the third unit of electricity generators (Sirajganj 3) began on October 19, 2017. Unit 3 was connected to the grid on May 27, 2018.

Bank of China contributes to syndicated buyer's credit loan for Unit 3 of 220 MW Sirajganj Combined Cycle Power Plant Project (Linked to Project ID#56541)

# Description
In June 2017, North-West Power Generation Company Limited signed a $196.7 million syndicated buyer's credit loan agreement with a group of Chinese and non-Chinese lenders (including Standard Chartered Bank, Bank of China, Siemens Bank, and Deutsche Pfandbriefbank AG) for Unit 3 of the 220MW Sirajganj Combined Cycle Power Plant Project. Standard Chartered Bank acted as Mandated Lead Arranger for this transaction. Other roles performed by Standard Chartered Bank includes Structuring Bank, ECA Coordinator, Account Bank, Intercreditor Agent, Hermes Facility Agent, Sinosure Facility Agent, Commercial (MIGA) Facility Agent and Security Agent. The transaction was structured as a long-term loan with a maturity of 15 years and a grace period of 3 years. The loan was scheduled for repayment in 24 semi-annual installments. The loan was split into 3 tranches: a $118.36 million Sinosure-insured loan tranche from Bank of China and Siemens Bank; a $34.03 million Euler Hermes-insured tranche from Deutsche Pfandbriefbank AG, and a $44.34 million commercial tranche insured by MIGA NHSFO from Standard Charted Bank.  The Euler Hermes-insured tranche carried an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 1.8% margin, while the Sinosure-insured tranche carried an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3% margin and the MIGA-insured carried an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 1.8% margin.  The loan had achieved an 81.6% disbursement rate ($160.68 million out of $196.7 million) as of June 30, 2019 and a 97% disbursement rate ($190.87 million out of $196.7 million) as of June 30, 2020.  The Government of Bangladesh provided a sovereign guarantee for debt service. The loan was also secured (collateralized) with a charge on project assets, including accounts, and assignment of project contracts. The syndicated loan covered 80% of the costs of the project, with the other 20% coming from North-West Power Generation Company Limited.  The borrower (NWPGCL) was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract that it signed with a consortium consisting of China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation (CMC) and Fujian Electric Power Survey & Design Institute (FEDI) on July 12, 2015.   The purpose of the project was to construct the third power generation unit (Unit 3) of the 220 MW Sirajganj Combined Cycle Power Plant. More specifically, the project involved the involves the installation of one gas turbine generator (GTG) capable of operating on natural gas and/or High Speed Diesel (HSD), one Gas Booster Compressor, one heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), evaporators, cooling towers, main and by pass stacks connected to a steam turbine Generator (STG) of condensing type for indoor installation, condensate and feed water system, cooling water system and auxiliary equipment.  The project site is located about 15 km south-east of Sirajganj town and 135 km north-west of Dhaka on the western bank of the River Jamuna. It is located in Khas Barashimul Mouza in the Saidabad Union of Sirajganj Sadar Upazilla (sub-district) of Sirajganj District. The closest settlements to the project site, Boroshimul and Ponchosona, are both located approximately 1 km from the complex.   China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC) was the EPC contractor responsible for overall project management. FEDI was responsible for providing technical expertise, including concept design and basic engineering. Under the EPC contract, the contractors were required to commission the project within 2.5 years of the start date. Construction of the third unit of electricity generators (Sirajganj 3) began on October 19, 2017. Unit 3 was connected to the grid on May 27, 2018. The plant began commercial operations on January 20, 2019. CMC and FEDI were also the contractors responsible for the implementation of the Bank of China and China Eximbank-financed Unit 2 of the 220MW Sirajganj Combined Cycle Power Plant Project, which is captured via Project ID#56541.

Because the individual contributions of the banks are unknown, AidData assumes equal contributions ($339,333,333) across the three members of the loan syndicate. Project ID#67350 records ICBC’s contribution, and Project ID#92199 records China Eximbank’s contribution. This loan carried the following borrowing terms: a maturity period of 13 years, a grace period of 4 years, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3.45% margin. Park Holding A.Ş., WE Soda Kimya Yatırımları A.Ş., and Ciner Kimya Yatırımları A.Ş. issued corporate guarantees in support of the loan. The borrower also purchased a buyer’s credit insurance policy from Sinosure. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by Kazan Soda Elektrik Üretim A.Ş. to finance 85% of the cost of a commercial contract with China Tianchen Engineering Co., Ltd. Repayment of the loan commenced on December 20, 2018 and was scheduled to continue until June 20, 2027. The loan’s amount outstanding as of December 31, 2019 was $800.5 million; of December 13, 2020 was $736.8 million.   The Kazan Soda Ash and Power Station Project had three components: mining, processing, and cogeneration. While the mining area is located in Kahramankazan district, the production plant is situated within the Sincan district of Ankara Province, northwest of Ankara. It is about 35 km (22 mi) north of Ankara. The plant's mining section supplies the processing section with the trona solution (trisodium hydrogendicarbonate dihydrate), which is the primary source of soda ash. For this, trona ore, laying on average at a depth of 600 m (2,000 ft) underground, is injected with hot water through boreholes drilled, and the dissolved trona is pumped up in the form of trona solution. The plant has five processing lines. The congeneration facility produces 380 MWe electric power and 400 tons of steam. Upon completion, it was expected that the annual production capacity of the plant would reach 2.5 million tons of soda ash (sodium carbonate, Na2CO3) and 200,000 tons of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3), and Ciner Group would become the world's largest soda ash producer (Note: Natural soda ash is more environmentally friendly than the corresponding synthetic alternatives in terms of waste and energy consumption).

98814,ENERGY,"China Development Bank contributes to $1.78 billion buyer's credit for 2x660 MW Supercritical Coal-Fired Banskhali Power Plant Project (Linked to Project ID#52792, #98804, #98815, #54275)","In November 2010, Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) began looking for sponsors to support the construction of a 2x660 MW supercritical coal-fired power plant — known as the 2x660 MW Supercritical Coal-Fired Banskhali Power Plant — in Paschim Gandamara within Banskhali Upzila and Chittagong Division. Then, on December 19, 2013, S. Alam Group — a Bangladeshi company that is active in the commodity trade, banking, insurance, and transportation sector — signed a deal with Shangdong Electric Power Corporation III (SEPCO III), a subsidiary of China Power Construction Co. (PowerChina), to set-up a joint venture company to finance, design, construct, and operate the 2x660 MW Supercritical Coal-Fired Banskhali Power Plant. The special purpose vehicle that was established, SS Power I Limited, is jointly owned by S. Alam Group (70% equity stake), SEPCO III Electric Power Construction Corporation (20% equity stake), and HTG Development Group Co. Ltd. (10% equity stake).  The $2.506 billion Banskhali Power Plant is an independent power project (IPP) that was implemented on a build, own, and operate (BOO) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 71.1:28.9. On December 28, 2018, a syndicate of banks — including Bank of China (Qingdao Branch) as an arranger, lender, and original hedging bank, Bank of China Limited (Singapore Branch) as a lender, facility agent, offshore security agent, and offshore account bank, China Development Bank (CDB) as an arranger and lender, China Construction Bank (Shandong Branch) as an arranger, lender, original hedging bank, Agricultural Bank of China (Qingdao Branch) as a lender, China Minsheng Bank (Qingdao Branch) as a lender, and Rupali Bank Limited as a lender, onshore security agent, and onshore account bank — signed a $1.782 billion USD syndicated buyer’s credit agreement with SS Power I Limited for the 2x660 MW Supercritical Coal-Fired Banskhali Power Plant Project. The buyer’s credit carried a 15-year maturity and an unknown interest rate. It was also supported by a Sinosure credit insurance policy and secured by (collateralized against) a share pledge, account pledge, a mortgage and debenture. AidData estimates that Bank of China contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#52792), CCB contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#98804), CDB contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#98814), and that ABC also contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#98815).  The borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to finance (a) 85% of the cost a $1.86 billion commercial (EPC) contract between S. Alam Group and SEPCO III, which was signed on June 29, 2015; and (b) 85% of the cost of the Sinosure premium and interest during construction under the senior buyer’s credit facility. The syndicated loan covered 71.1% of the total project cost. S. Alam Group, SEPCO III, and HTG Development Group Co. Ltd. were expected to cover the remaining 28.9% via equity contributions. Project ID#52792 captures the debt financing for the project, while Project ID#54275 captures the equity financing for the project.  The purpose of the project was to construct a supercritical coal-fired power plant — with two 660 MW supercritical power generation units — and a new special coal unloading wharf in Paschim Gandamara within Banskhali Upzila and Chittagong Division (exact locational coordinates: 21.970844, 91.888932). The IPP is governed by the terms of an Implementation Agreement (IA) and a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) executed with Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB).  SEPCO III is the general engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor responsible for project implementation. However, several other contractors are also involved in the project. Dongfang Electric Corporation is responsible for providing the turbine generators, while Babcock & Wilcox Beijing Co., Ltd. is responsible for providing the boiler equipment. Sinohydro Foundation Engineering Co., Ltd. is also involved in project implementation. A formal project unveiling ceremony took place on October 14, 2016, with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina laying the plant's foundation. However, project implementation did not begin until significantly later. A notice to proceed (NTP) was issued to the EPC contractor on December 10, 2018, and project implementation commenced on December 31, 2018. As stipulated in the EPC contract, the project completion date was scheduled to fall between 39 and 40 months (March 31, 2022 or April 30, 2022) after the EPC commencement date and the NTP date.  The construction of the Banskhali Power Plant has been the source of significant, often violent, controversy in Bangladesh. Villagers opposed to the plant began peaceful protests during the S. Alam Group's land acquisition efforts, decrying the displacement because of the plant's construction. Then, on April 4, 2016, 500 villagers gathered on the grounds of Gondamara School to protest against the construction of the plant, despite local authorities having banned the demonstration. The demonstration turned violent, as police opened fire, killing four protesters and wounding 30 more. Then, in early February 2017, at a community meeting in Abhaittya Ghona in Banskhali, sponsored by the Bangladesh Navy, the S. Alam Group, and local authorities, clashes broke out between pro and anti-plant factions (which were composed of followers of a local Awami League leader and Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader, respectively) that led to the death of a pro-plant man and injured 16 more. After the clashes, the Bangladesh Navy began to supervise the project site's security along the local police.  In July 2020, the sponsors of the project were fined ৳2,000,000,000 BDT for delays in the construction works and received a two-year extension to the project period. Then, on April 17, 2021, clashes erupted between the Banskhali police and construction workers at the plant, supported by local people. The workers had been protesting over unpaid wages. The resulting altercation saw the police kill five workers and critically wound a dozen more. During the protest, workers committed arson and vandalism in the construction period. Two more workers died of their injuries, raising the death toll to seven. The next month, on May 28, 2021, police arrested a local Bangladeshi engineer for posting an anti-power plant message on Facebook under Bangladesh's Digital Security Act.  One cause of the resistance to the power plant is allegations from local residents near the power plant that the S. Alam Group bought their land to construct a garment factory to increase local employment, not a polluting power plant. The resistance was reportedly so strong that the S. Alam Group was willing to shift the entire plant to Chokoria if it could not convince the locals to support the plant. Another cause of protests was the environmental impact of the plant. An analysis of the air quality segment of the project's Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) by the Helsinki-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, in collaboration with the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association and the Bangladesh Working Group on External Debt, found that the EIA was filled with false information and omitted key details, in violation of the laws of Bangladesh. For example, the EIA failed to discuss the health impacts of the plant or mercy pollution, and falsely claimed that the air quality in Banskhali met Bangladeshi standards. The conclusions of the review suggested that the low-quality of the EIA was either the result of gross incompetence or deliberate manipulation. In a June 2021 letter to China's Commerce Minister, 129 activists and 79 organizations from 21 countries, including a number of well-known Bangladeshi figures, asked the Chinese Government to withdraw financing and technical support from the Banskhali Power Plant Project based on the project's lack of transparency, violations of human rights, and environmental damage.","1.

Banskhali is also spelled Banshkhali.2. Several sources suggest that the Export-Import Bank of China was involved this financing this project, despite its absence on an Industrial and Commercial Bank of China webpage describing the structure of the syndicated loan that supported the project. This issue merits further investigation.3. The exact size of BOC, ABC, CDB, and CCB's respective financial contributions to the $1.78 billion syndicated loan are unknown.

The $2.506 billion Banskhali Power Plant is an independent power project (IPP) that was implemented on a build, own, and operate (BOO) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 71.1:28.9. On December 28, 2018, a syndicate of banks — including Bank of China (Qingdao Branch) as an arranger, lender, and original hedging bank, Bank of China Limited (Singapore Branch) as a lender, facility agent, offshore security agent, and offshore account bank, China Development Bank (CDB) as an arranger and lender, China Construction Bank (Shandong Branch) as an arranger, lender, original hedging bank, Agricultural Bank of China (Qingdao Branch) as a lender, China Minsheng Bank (Qingdao Branch) as a lender, and Rupali Bank Limited as a lender, onshore security agent, and onshore account bank — signed a $1.782 billion USD syndicated buyer’s credit agreement with SS Power I Limited for the 2x660 MW Supercritical Coal-Fired Banskhali Power Plant Project. The buyer’s credit carried a 15-year maturity and an unknown interest rate. It was also supported by a Sinosure credit insurance policy and secured by (collateralized against) a share pledge, account pledge, a mortgage and debenture. AidData estimates that Bank of China contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#52792), CCB contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#98804), CDB contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#98814), and that ABC also contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#98815).  The borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to finance (a) 85% of the cost a $1.86 billion commercial (EPC) contract between S. Alam Group and SEPCO III, which was signed on June 29, 2015; and (b) 85% of the cost of the Sinosure premium and interest during construction under the senior buyer’s credit facility. The syndicated loan covered 71.1% of the total project cost. S. Alam Group, SEPCO III, and HTG Development Group Co. Ltd. were expected to cover the remaining 28.9% via equity contributions. Project ID#52792 captures the debt financing for the project, while Project ID#54275 captures the equity financing for the project.  The purpose of the project was to construct a supercritical coal-fired power plant — with two 660 MW supercritical power generation units — and a new special coal unloading wharf in Paschim Gandamara within Banskhali Upzila and Chittagong Division (exact locational coordinates: 21.970844, 91.888932). The IPP is governed by the terms of an Implementation Agreement (IA) and a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) executed with Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB).  SEPCO III is the general engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor responsible for project implementation. However, several other contractors are also involved in the project. Dongfang Electric Corporation is responsible for providing the turbine generators, while Babcock & Wilcox Beijing Co., Ltd. is responsible for providing the boiler equipment. Sinohydro Foundation Engineering Co., Ltd. is also involved in project implementation. A formal project unveiling ceremony took place on October 14, 2016, with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina laying the plant's foundation. However, project implementation did not begin until significantly later. A notice to proceed (NTP) was issued to the EPC contractor on December 10, 2018, and project implementation commenced on December 31, 2018. As stipulated in the EPC contract, the project completion date was scheduled to fall between 39 and 40 months (March 31, 2022 or April 30, 2022) after the EPC commencement date and the NTP date.  The construction of the Banskhali Power Plant has been the source of significant, often violent, controversy in Bangladesh. Villagers opposed to the plant began peaceful protests during the S. Alam Group's land acquisition efforts, decrying the displacement because of the plant's construction. Then, on April 4, 2016, 500 villagers gathered on the grounds of Gondamara School to protest against the construction of the plant, despite local authorities having banned the demonstration. The demonstration turned violent, as police opened fire, killing four protesters and wounding 30 more. Then, in early February 2017, at a community meeting in Abhaittya Ghona in Banskhali, sponsored by the Bangladesh Navy, the S. Alam Group, and local authorities, clashes broke out between pro and anti-plant factions (which were composed of followers of a local Awami League leader and Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader, respectively) that led to the death of a pro-plant man and injured 16 more. After the clashes, the Bangladesh Navy began to supervise the project site's security along the local police.  In July 2020, the sponsors of the project were fined ৳2,000,000,000 BDT for delays in the construction works and received a two-year extension to the project period. Then, on April 17, 2021, clashes erupted between the Banskhali police and construction workers at the plant, supported by local people. The workers had been protesting over unpaid wages. The resulting altercation saw the police kill five workers and critically wound a dozen more. During the protest, workers committed arson and vandalism in the construction period. Two more workers died of their injuries, raising the death toll to seven. The next month, on May 28, 2021, police arrested a local Bangladeshi engineer for posting an anti-power plant message on Facebook under Bangladesh's Digital Security Act.  One cause of the resistance to the power plant is allegations from local residents near the power plant that the S. Alam Group bought their land to construct a garment factory to increase local employment, not a polluting power plant. The resistance was reportedly so strong that the S. Alam Group was willing to shift the entire plant to Chokoria if it could not convince the locals to support the plant. Another cause of protests was the environmental impact of the plant. An analysis of the air quality segment of the project's Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) by the Helsinki-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, in collaboration with the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association and the Bangladesh Working Group on External Debt, found that the EIA was filled with false information and omitted key details, in violation of the laws of Bangladesh. For example, the EIA failed to discuss the health impacts of the plant or mercy pollution, and falsely claimed that the air quality in Banskhali met Bangladeshi standards. The conclusions of the review suggested that the low-quality of the EIA was either the result of gross incompetence or deliberate manipulation. In a June 2021 letter to China's Commerce Minister, 129 activists and 79 organizations from 21 countries, including a number of well-known Bangladeshi figures, asked the Chinese Government to withdraw financing and technical support from the Banskhali Power Plant Project based on the project's lack of transparency, violations of human rights, and environmental damage.

Then, on December 19, 2013, S. Alam Group — a Bangladeshi company that is active in the commodity trade, banking, insurance, and transportation sector — signed a deal with Shangdong Electric Power Corporation III (SEPCO III), a subsidiary of China Power Construction Co. (PowerChina), to set-up a joint venture company to finance, design, construct, and operate the 2x660 MW Supercritical Coal-Fired Banskhali Power Plant. The special purpose vehicle that was established, SS Power I Limited, is jointly owned by S. Alam Group (70% equity stake), SEPCO III Electric Power Construction Corporation (20% equity stake), and HTG Development Group Co. Ltd. (10% equity stake).  The $2.506 billion Banskhali Power Plant is an independent power project (IPP) that was implemented on a build, own, and operate (BOO) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 71.1:28.9. On December 28, 2018, a syndicate of banks — including Bank of China (Qingdao Branch) as an arranger, lender, and original hedging bank, Bank of China Limited (Singapore Branch) as a lender, facility agent, offshore security agent, and offshore account bank, China Development Bank (CDB) as an arranger and lender, China Construction Bank (Shandong Branch) as an arranger, lender, original hedging bank, Agricultural Bank of China (Qingdao Branch) as a lender, China Minsheng Bank (Qingdao Branch) as a lender, and Rupali Bank Limited as a lender, onshore security agent, and onshore account bank — signed a $1.782 billion USD syndicated buyer’s credit agreement with SS Power I Limited for the 2x660 MW Supercritical Coal-Fired Banskhali Power Plant Project. The buyer’s credit carried a 15-year maturity and an unknown interest rate. It was also supported by a Sinosure credit insurance policy and secured by (collateralized against) a share pledge, account pledge, a mortgage and debenture. AidData estimates that Bank of China contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#52792), CCB contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#98804), CDB contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#98814), and that ABC also contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#98815).  The borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to finance (a) 85% of the cost a $1.86 billion commercial (EPC) contract between S. Alam Group and SEPCO III, which was signed on June 29, 2015; and (b) 85% of the cost of the Sinosure premium and interest during construction under the senior buyer’s credit facility. The syndicated loan covered 71.1% of the total project cost. S. Alam Group, SEPCO III, and HTG Development Group Co. Ltd. were expected to cover the remaining 28.9% via equity contributions. Project ID#52792 captures the debt financing for the project, while Project ID#54275 captures the equity financing for the project.  The purpose of the project was to construct a supercritical coal-fired power plant — with two 660 MW supercritical power generation units — and a new special coal unloading wharf in Paschim Gandamara within Banskhali Upzila and Chittagong Division (exact locational coordinates: 21.970844, 91.888932). The IPP is governed by the terms of an Implementation Agreement (IA) and a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) executed with Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB).  SEPCO III is the general engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor responsible for project implementation. However, several other contractors are also involved in the project. Dongfang Electric Corporation is responsible for providing the turbine generators, while Babcock & Wilcox Beijing Co., Ltd. is responsible for providing the boiler equipment. Sinohydro Foundation Engineering Co., Ltd. is also involved in project implementation. A formal project unveiling ceremony took place on October 14, 2016, with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina laying the plant's foundation. However, project implementation did not begin until significantly later. A notice to proceed (NTP) was issued to the EPC contractor on December 10, 2018, and project implementation commenced on December 31, 2018. As stipulated in the EPC contract, the project completion date was scheduled to fall between 39 and 40 months (March 31, 2022 or April 30, 2022) after the EPC commencement date and the NTP date.  The construction of the Banskhali Power Plant has been the source of significant, often violent, controversy in Bangladesh. Villagers opposed to the plant began peaceful protests during the S. Alam Group's land acquisition efforts, decrying the displacement because of the plant's construction. Then, on April 4, 2016, 500 villagers gathered on the grounds of Gondamara School to protest against the construction of the plant, despite local authorities having banned the demonstration. The demonstration turned violent, as police opened fire, killing four protesters and wounding 30 more. Then, in early February 2017, at a community meeting in Abhaittya Ghona in Banskhali, sponsored by the Bangladesh Navy, the S. Alam Group, and local authorities, clashes broke out between pro and anti-plant factions (which were composed of followers of a local Awami League leader and Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader, respectively) that led to the death of a pro-plant man and injured 16 more. After the clashes, the Bangladesh Navy began to supervise the project site's security along the local police.  In July 2020, the sponsors of the project were fined ৳2,000,000,000 BDT for delays in the construction works and received a two-year extension to the project period. Then, on April 17, 2021, clashes erupted between the Banskhali police and construction workers at the plant, supported by local people. The workers had been protesting over unpaid wages. The resulting altercation saw the police kill five workers and critically wound a dozen more. During the protest, workers committed arson and vandalism in the construction period. Two more workers died of their injuries, raising the death toll to seven. The next month, on May 28, 2021, police arrested a local Bangladeshi engineer for posting an anti-power plant message on Facebook under Bangladesh's Digital Security Act.  One cause of the resistance to the power plant is allegations from local residents near the power plant that the S. Alam Group bought their land to construct a garment factory to increase local employment, not a polluting power plant. The resistance was reportedly so strong that the S. Alam Group was willing to shift the entire plant to Chokoria if it could not convince the locals to support the plant. Another cause of protests was the environmental impact of the plant. An analysis of the air quality segment of the project's Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) by the Helsinki-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, in collaboration with the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association and the Bangladesh Working Group on External Debt, found that the EIA was filled with false information and omitted key details, in violation of the laws of Bangladesh. For example, the EIA failed to discuss the health impacts of the plant or mercy pollution, and falsely claimed that the air quality in Banskhali met Bangladeshi standards. The conclusions of the review suggested that the low-quality of the EIA was either the result of gross incompetence or deliberate manipulation. In a June 2021 letter to China's Commerce Minister, 129 activists and 79 organizations from 21 countries, including a number of well-known Bangladeshi figures, asked the Chinese Government to withdraw financing and technical support from the Banskhali Power Plant Project based on the project's lack of transparency, violations of human rights, and environmental damage.","1.

However, the ADB did not follow up on the project due to its marginal financial viability and its potentially serious environmental and social impacts, especially on migratory fish stocks and fishing livelihoods. Then, in June 2007, the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy (MIME) of Cambodia granted permission for Electricité du Viet Nam (EVN) to conduct a detailed feasibility study. The study was implemented by a consulting firm, Power Engineering Consulting Joint Stock Company 1 (PECC1), in collaboration and consultation with technical ministries/agencies of the Royal Government of Cambodia. Then, on November 26, 2012, The Government of Cambodia and Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and joint venture of the Royal Group of Cambodia (39%), Hydrolancang International Energy (51%), and Vietnam Electricity (EVN) (10%) — signed an implementation agreement (IA) for the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project. On the same day, Électricité du Cambodge (EDC) and Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Under these two agreements, Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. was granted a 45-year concession (40 years of operation and a construction period of 5 years) and it was specified that the electricity generated by Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. — through the Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant — would be sold to EDC at the fixed price of 6.95 US cents per kilowatt-hour. These agreements also specified that, after 40 years of operation, the ownership of the Lower Sesan II dam will be transferred to the Government of Cambodia. On December 12, 2012, the Government of Cambodia also agreed to guarantee the payment (power purchase) obligations of EDC and Cambodia’s Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy to Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd under the PPA and the IA.  The total cost of the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project, which was implemented on a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis, was $978 million and it was financed with a mix of debt and equity. In December 2013, China Development Bank (captured via Project ID#62217), ICBC (captured via Project ID#92481), and Bank of China (captured via Project ID#92483) provided a $781 million debt financing package (with a 17-year maturity and an interest rate of 6.5%) to Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. for the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project. The financing was structured in the 2 tranches: (i) an initial bridge financing with ICBC under a financial leasing structure (the first for an infrastructure project in Cambodia); and (ii) a subsequent project financing by China Development Bank and Bank of China. Sinosure provided credit insurance. The Government of Cambodia issued a sovereign guarantee in the event on non-payment by EDC.  The purpose of this project was to construct a hydroelectric power plant in the northeastern province of Stung Treng on the Se San River. Its locational coordinates are 13°32′59.5″N 106°15′49.4″E. The Lower Sesan II Dam is 80 meters tall and occupies a 36,000-hectare plot. The plant has eight turbines and each turbine has an installed capacity of 50 megawatts (400 MW total capacity). Upon completion, the plant was expected to produce 1.9 billion kilowatt-hours per year, boost electricity production in the country by 20%, and bring installed hydropower capacity to 1328MW.  PowerChina HuaDong Engineering Corporation Limited (HDEC) was the contractor responsible for project design. Sinohydro Bureau 8 Co., Ltd was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began in December 2013. The watergate was officially closed on September 25, 2017. The first turbine began producing electricity in November 2017. The dam was officially opened on December 18, 2018.   The Chinese banks that financed the project divided environmental and social risks control into specific segments, including pre-loan investigation, loan review, contract management, loan issuance and post-loan management. They also required an environmental impact assessment (EIA) after the completion of the project. CDB went even further by introducing a standard review procedure. Sinosure also required that the project developer pay special attention to social and environmental responsibilities -- in particular, by resolving controversies around the dam through public consultation. The project developer held several public consultations with the affected communities in line with the guidelines of the Chinese banks. In July 2015, as requested by the local staff members of the CDB, the project developer held a dialogue with 140 people representing communities affected by the 400MW Lower Sesan II hydropower plant, Cambodian government representatives at national and sub-national levels, and NGOs to discuss their concerns and other issues related to the project. The participants then paid a visit on July 27, 2014 to the resettlement site to inspect on the quality of the housing construction, agricultural land, and dam construction. During the visit, community representatives and media held an informal on-site dialogue and raised questions to the Ministry of Mine and Energy’s secretary of state, project development, and the Stung Treng Deputy Governor in charge of Resettlement and Compensation Committee.

95921,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",Bank of China and ICBC participate in $360 million syndicated PxF facility for the Basrah Natural Gas Liquids Facility Construction Project,"On June 24, 2021, Basrah Gas Company (BGC or شركة غاز البصرة) — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of the Government of Iraq (51% ownership stake), Royal Dutch Shell (44% ownership stake), and Mitsubishi (5% ownership stake) — signed a $180 million syndicated pre-export financing (PxF) agreement with a group of eight international banks (Bank of China, Citi, Deutsche Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Natixis, SMBC, Société Générale, Standard Chartered) for the Basrah Natural Gas Liquids Facility Construction Project. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 5-year maturity an an estimated interest rate of 5%.  In parallel, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) issued a $137.76 million loan and a $42.24 million loan through its Managed Co-Lending Portfolio Program. The IFC also served as the lead arranger of the $180 million syndicated loan.  The purpose of the project is to construct a new Basrah natural gas liquids facility in the Ar-Ratawi area in the west of Basra — with two natural gas liquids trains, each of 200m cubic feet per day capacity — and expand gas processing by introducing additional NGL separation gas treatment. More specifically, the project scope has three main components: (i) the process trains, (ii) works in the immediate vicinity of the process trains, including power and water supply, (iii) four pipelines and their tie ins including a 13.7 km feed gas pipeline from BGC’s North Rumaila NGL plant, an 80 km broadcut export to the BGC KAZ facility, a 10.2 km dry gas pipeline to connect to the Iraqi gas grid, and a 17 km water supply pipeline from the Rumaila Operating Organization’s Al Nukhail Water Pumping Station. BGC gathers, treats and processes associated gas that would otherwise be flared at oil fields of West Qurna 1, Zubair and Rumaila in southern Iraq.   Prior to the implementation of the project, the capture and processing of associated gas from the upstream oil fields was limited by the capacity of BGC’s existing natural-gas-liquids plants and export infrastructure.  Upon completion, the project is expected to increase BGC’s capacity to 1.4bcf per day by 2024. Société Générale claims that the project is one of ‘the largest gas flaring reduction projects in the world, helping to improve energy access, prevent associated greenhouse gas emissions and support a more resilient, sustainable energy sector in Iraq.’ The country has vast natural gas reserves, largely a by-product of oil extraction, yet has generally been unable to put those reserves to use.  Iraq has committed to eliminate all routine natural gas flaring by 2030, but around 70% of all natural gas it produces is flared. Flaring gas is both a waste of resources and a contributor to climate change. The Basrah Natural Gas Liquids Facility Construction Project aims to reverse that trend through the development of a processing plant, allowing capture and treatment of natural gas that would otherwise be wasted. The resulting fuels can then be used to generate energy domestically, or exported in the form of liquified petroleum gas or condensate products.  China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Corporation (CPECC) is the contractor responsible for project implementation. It signed a $170 million commercial contract with BGC on February 27, 2019.  IFC’s environmental and social due diligence of this project consisted of the appraisal of technical, environmental, health, safety and social information submitted by BGC. A lenders’ Independent Engineer (“IE”) was commissioned by IFC assessing both the environmental and social aspects of the project along with the engineering and technical aspects of the operation. The consultant produced an independent due diligence report which has been reviewed by BGC, IFC and other lenders. IFC’s environmental and social (E&S) appraisal team undertook a field visit in March 2019 meeting with members of BGC’s senior management team, project teams, BGC’s corporate health, safety and environment (“HSE”) manager, environment manager and environmental advisors, human resources, social performance, operations managers and supporting teams at the respective plants and corporate and asset level security management. IFC also visited three existing BGC processing assets, namely the Umm Qasr storage and marine terminal, the North Rumaila NGL and NSC2 and the KAZ NGL plant. Complementing IFC’s appraisal visit, the IE undertook a field appraisal in August 2019 visiting the NR NGL and KAZ NGL plants, compressor station 2 and the Umm Qasr storage and marine terminals.   Project implementation commenced on or around October 15, 2019. The project had achieved an 8.33% completion rate as of December 2019.

95996,ENERGY,Government of Iraq secures oil-backed loan for 1260MW Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#95982),"On May 11, 2018, China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) and the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Iraq signed an export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement (contract ID# FA-IRAQ-001). Under the terms of the 20-year agreement, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Iraq is authorized to borrow up to $10 billion (or an equivalent amount in other currencies such as RMB) via subsidiary buyer’s credit facility agreements with PRC banks and/or commercial contracts with deferred payment clauses (i.e. supplier’s credits) with Chinese companies (exporters) for projects in the ‘oil, gas, energy, infrastructure, communications, education, healthcare or electricity sectors’ that are ‘located in the areas in Iraq deemed safe by the Embassy of China and the Government of Iraq.’ All borrowings under the framework agreement, which is captured via Project ID#95982, must carry maturity lengths that do not exceed 15 years and they must be backed by an approved credit insurance policy from Sinosure. The framework agreement also specifies that the Government of Iraq is responsible for making advance payments worth no less than 15% of the total cost of the underlying commercial contracts supported by the subsidiary buyer’s credits and supplier’s credits.   To repay and secure these borrowings, the framework agreement specifies that a Crude Oil Sales Agreement between Iraq's state-owned oil marketing company (SOMO or شركة تسويق النفط) and an unspecified Chinese oil importer, wherein SOMO agrees to sell no fewer than 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day to the Chinese oil importer and the Chinese oil importer agrees to make payments to SOMO due under the Crude Oil Sales Agreement by depositing U.S. dollars (or another foreign currency) in a Sinosure-designated and lender-controlled bank (escrow) account (that is opened on behalf of the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Iraq to facilitate debt repayment).  Under the terms of the framework agreement, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Iraq is required to maintain a minimum cash balance of $100 million in a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) and pledge the DSRA in favor of Sinosure. Apart from the DSRA, the framework agreement refers to two additional escrow accounts: an Oil Settlement Account and a Repayment Account. All oil sale proceeds first flow to the Oil Settlement Account. Then, after deductions are made by the United Nations Compensation Commission for compensation due to Kuwait, the remaining revenue flows to the Repayment Account (so long as there is still a $100 million minimum cash balance in the DSRA) and principal and interest payments to lenders are made from the Repayment Account.   On September 23, 2019, account agreement and oil agreement annexes to the framework agreement were finalized. Then, on September 23, 2019, the framework agreement officially went into effect. Approximately 15 months later, in December 2020, a Financial Advisor to Iraq’s Prime Minister, Dr. Mudhar Muhammad Salih, told the Iraqi News Agency (INA), that Iraq’s House of Representatives would need to identify the specific projects to be funded under the framework agreement and allocate funds for these projects in the Federal Budget Law. He also signaled at the time that the Iraqi Government planned to borrow through the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure to fund the construction of school buildings. Then, in June 2021, he announced that the 2021 Federal Budget Law included $2 billion for projects to be financed through the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure, which had entered into force. 5 months later, in November 2021, he told a local newspaper that several Chinese companies had deposited $1.8 billion in an account and the funds would be used to support the construction of 1,000 schools as well as ‘infrastructure and renewable power projects’. This announcement implies that the Government of Iraq ultimately decided to borrowed via commercial contracts with deferred payment clauses (i.e. supplier’s credits) with Chinese companies rather than buyer’s credit facilities with PRC banks. On June 30, 2022, Dr. Mudhar Muhammad Salih said that ‘[t]he operations of depositing money and withdrawing from the [escrow] account are continuing for the benefit of the projects concluded within the [export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure].’ He also noted that ‘the [escrow] account is managed very carefully by the Central Bank of Iraq, and the financial operations are audited by the major international financial auditing companies.’  There are three known projects — supported by four separate commercial contracts — that are being financed under the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure: the 1260MW Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant Construction Project, the Construction of 1000 Schools Project, and the Al-Nasiriyah International Airport Renovation and Expansion Project. In September 2013, China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) and Ministry of Electricity of Iraq signed a $1,189,132,251 commercial (EPC) contract for the 1260MW Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant Construction Project. This contract was amended on November 21, 2019 and its monetary value was increase by $140 million (to ~$1,329,132,251) after CMEC and the Government of Iraq signed a financing memorandum on September 22, 2019. The estimated monetary value of the supplier’s credit for the 1260MW Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant Construction Project is $1,129,762,413.35 (as captured via Project ID#95996).   The purpose of the project is to construct an oil-fired thermal power plant that consists of two subcritical, oil-fired generating units of 630MW capacity each (‘Unit 1’ and ‘Unit 2’). Upon completion, each unit is expected consist of a boiler drum along with a boiler furnace equipped with oil and gas nozzles, and a single shaft steam turbine. The boiler assembly will feature four-corner tangential combustion chamber, along with single-hearth balanced ventilation supported by steel structure frame. The design boiler maximum continuous rating (BMCR) will be 2136t/h. Each double back pressure, impulse type steam turbine will feature three cylinders and four exhausts. The other major components of the plant will include three-stage high pressure heaters, four- stage low pressure heaters, eight-stage regenerative deaerators, apart from steam-driven feedwater pumps. The project also includes four 20,000m3 oil mixing tanks, air compressors, as well as the construction of 400kV and 132kV booster stations. The electricity generated by the power project will be evacuated through a 400kV power transmission line connecting the national grid of Iraq. The power plant is located approximately 16 km southeast of the Samara city in Salah Al-din Province on the north bank of the Tigris River (and approximately 186 km north of Baghdad).   CMEC is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, Northwest Research Institute of Energy China, SGS, the Fourth Construction of China Machinery Industry Co., Ltd., China Valves Technology, Inc. and Sichuan Railway Investment Group Co., Ltd. are also involved in implementation as subcontractors.  Project implementation officially commenced on August 14, 2012. However, civil construction works did not begin until April 2013. The project was originally expected to reach completion within 45 months (January 2017). Construction works were suspended in June 2014 due to the fact that Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) launched a major attack in northern Iraq against the Iraqi government, which led to a major deterioration in the local security situation. Construction works resumed in mid-2018. As of August 2019, 1200 Chinese and Iraqi workers were assigned to the project. Then, on November 21, 2019, the Ministry of Electricity of Iraq (MOELC) and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) signed an expanded and amended EPC contract, which allocated $140 million of additional funding for additional repair and inspection work and the construction of a new 132kV substation. On April 1, 2020, Zhang Tao, the Chinese Ambassador to Iraq, and a team from the Red Cross Society of China visited the power plant and provided on-site Covid-19 pandemic prevention and control guidance. Fifteen days later. On April 16, 2020, the boiler hydraulic test for Unit 1 took place, marking an important milestone of the project. Unit 1 began trial operations on June 2, 2021. However in late-June 2021, ISIS launched a set of targeted by Katyusha rockets at the Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant and severely damaged parts of Unit 1.  The Unit 1 boiler was ignited on May 11 , 2022, and it was connected to the grid on May 12, 2022. Unit 1 then began a 720-hour reliability test on May 20, 2022. On June 19, 2022, Unit 1 passed the 720-hour reliability test. CMEC then handed over Unit 1 to the project owner in July 2022, which marked halfway point of the implementation of the project. On August 27, 2022, Unit 2 was connected to the national grid for the first time and officially put into operation.","1.

Approximately 15 months later, in December 2020, a Financial Advisor to Iraq’s Prime Minister, Dr. Mudhar Muhammad Salih, told the Iraqi News Agency (INA), that Iraq’s House of Representatives would need to identify the specific projects to be funded under the framework agreement and allocate funds for these projects in the Federal Budget Law. He also signaled at the time that the Iraqi Government planned to borrow through the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure to fund the construction of school buildings. Then, in June 2021, he announced that the 2021 Federal Budget Law included $2 billion for projects to be financed through the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure, which had entered into force. 5 months later, in November 2021, he told a local newspaper that several Chinese companies had deposited $1.8 billion in an account and the funds would be used to support the construction of 1,000 schools as well as ‘infrastructure and renewable power projects’. This announcement implies that the Government of Iraq ultimately decided to borrowed via commercial contracts with deferred payment clauses (i.e. supplier’s credits) with Chinese companies rather than buyer’s credit facilities with PRC banks. On June 30, 2022, Dr. Mudhar Muhammad Salih said that ‘[t]he operations of depositing money and withdrawing from the [escrow] account are continuing for the benefit of the projects concluded within the [export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure].’ He also noted that ‘the [escrow] account is managed very carefully by the Central Bank of Iraq, and the financial operations are audited by the major international financial auditing companies.’  There are three known projects — supported by four separate commercial contracts — that are being financed under the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure: the 1260MW Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant Construction Project, the Construction of 1000 Schools Project, and the Al-Nasiriyah International Airport Renovation and Expansion Project. In September 2013, China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) and Ministry of Electricity of Iraq signed a $1,189,132,251 commercial (EPC) contract for the 1260MW Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant Construction Project. This contract was amended on November 21, 2019 and its monetary value was increase by $140 million (to ~$1,329,132,251) after CMEC and the Government of Iraq signed a financing memorandum on September 22, 2019. The estimated monetary value of the supplier’s credit for the 1260MW Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant Construction Project is $1,129,762,413.35 (as captured via Project ID#95996).   The purpose of the project is to construct an oil-fired thermal power plant that consists of two subcritical, oil-fired generating units of 630MW capacity each (‘Unit 1’ and ‘Unit 2’). Upon completion, each unit is expected consist of a boiler drum along with a boiler furnace equipped with oil and gas nozzles, and a single shaft steam turbine. The boiler assembly will feature four-corner tangential combustion chamber, along with single-hearth balanced ventilation supported by steel structure frame. The design boiler maximum continuous rating (BMCR) will be 2136t/h. Each double back pressure, impulse type steam turbine will feature three cylinders and four exhausts. The other major components of the plant will include three-stage high pressure heaters, four- stage low pressure heaters, eight-stage regenerative deaerators, apart from steam-driven feedwater pumps. The project also includes four 20,000m3 oil mixing tanks, air compressors, as well as the construction of 400kV and 132kV booster stations. The electricity generated by the power project will be evacuated through a 400kV power transmission line connecting the national grid of Iraq. The power plant is located approximately 16 km southeast of the Samara city in Salah Al-din Province on the north bank of the Tigris River (and approximately 186 km north of Baghdad).   CMEC is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, Northwest Research Institute of Energy China, SGS, the Fourth Construction of China Machinery Industry Co., Ltd., China Valves Technology, Inc. and Sichuan Railway Investment Group Co., Ltd. are also involved in implementation as subcontractors.  Project implementation officially commenced on August 14, 2012. However, civil construction works did not begin until April 2013. The project was originally expected to reach completion within 45 months (January 2017). Construction works were suspended in June 2014 due to the fact that Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) launched a major attack in northern Iraq against the Iraqi government, which led to a major deterioration in the local security situation. Construction works resumed in mid-2018. As of August 2019, 1200 Chinese and Iraqi workers were assigned to the project. Then, on November 21, 2019, the Ministry of Electricity of Iraq (MOELC) and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) signed an expanded and amended EPC contract, which allocated $140 million of additional funding for additional repair and inspection work and the construction of a new 132kV substation. On April 1, 2020, Zhang Tao, the Chinese Ambassador to Iraq, and a team from the Red Cross Society of China visited the power plant and provided on-site Covid-19 pandemic prevention and control guidance. Fifteen days later. On April 16, 2020, the boiler hydraulic test for Unit 1 took place, marking an important milestone of the project. Unit 1 began trial operations on June 2, 2021. However in late-June 2021, ISIS launched a set of targeted by Katyusha rockets at the Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant and severely damaged parts of Unit 1.  The Unit 1 boiler was ignited on May 11 , 2022, and it was connected to the grid on May 12, 2022. Unit 1 then began a 720-hour reliability test on May 20, 2022. On June 19, 2022, Unit 1 passed the 720-hour reliability test. CMEC then handed over Unit 1 to the project owner in July 2022, which marked halfway point of the implementation of the project. On August 27, 2022, Unit 2 was connected to the national grid for the first time and officially put into operation.

38342,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides $405.8 million preferential buyer’s credit for Multi Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project (Linked to Project ID #52873 and #55046) [BRI],"On June 9, 2014, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, visited China and the Chinese Government and the Government of Bangladesh signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on the Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project. Then, on November 14, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed an RMB 1,950,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement and a $405.8 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project. The GCL carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a grace period of 5 years, and a 0.2% commitment fee. The PBC carries the following terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a grace period of 5 years, and a 0.2% commitment fee. Project ID#55046 captures the GCL, while Project ID#38342 captures the PBC. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the GCL and the PBC to finance a commercial contract between the Government of Bangladesh’s Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges and China Communication Construction Company (CCCC), which was signed in June 2015. The GCL had disbursed RMB 936,1890,000 as of June 30, 2018, RMB 1,557,869,000 as of June 30, 2019, RMB 1,950,000,000 as of June 30, 2020, and RMB 1,950,000,000 as of June 30, 2021. No repayments on the GCL had been made as of June 30, 2019 or June 30, 2021. As of June 30, 2021, the PBC had disbursed $165.559 million and no repayments had been made.   The purpose of the project, which is also known as the Multilane Karnaphuli Tunnel Project, is to construct a 3.4-kilometer-long, 10 meter-wide tunnel under the Karnaphuli River near the Port of Chittagong. The total length of the proposed tunnel will be around 9.092 kilometers, including a 3.40-kilometer tunnel under the Karnaphuli River with an approach road of 4.89 kilometers alongside 740 meters of bridges linking the main port city, and western side of the Karnaphuli along with the eastern side of the river. Upon completion, the tunnel will connect the port of Chittagong to the industrial area of the city and thereby relieve pressure on the three existing bridges. The total area of the project is 382.03 acres. More than 360.64 acres of land were acquired for the construction of roads and installments of utility lines.  A total of 2,275 families are affected by this project, and 1,660 were given compensation. China Communication Construction Company (CCCC) is the general (EPC) contractor responsible for project implementation. On November 24, 2015, the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) approved the Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project. Construction began on February 24, 2017.  Two years later, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh officially inaugurated boring works on the tunnel on February 24, 2019. The project had achieved a 40% physical completion rate by May 2019, including the installation of over 150 meters of the first tunnel and much of the above-ground works. Then, on July 31, 2020, the project reached a key milestone with the completion of the first underwater, after a made-in-China super-diameter slurry-pressure-balance tunnel boring machine (TBM) broke through at the Karnaphuli River east bank working shaft.    The TBM, which is 94 meters long and weighs more than 2,200 tons, was developed by the Tianhe Mechanical Equipment Manufacturing Co. It was the first super-diameter slurry-pressure-balance TBM to be self-developed and exported by China. The TBM uses several self-developed technologies, such as an automatic mud water circulation system. As of October 2021, all boring-related work was completed — after the excavation of the second tube (from Anwara end of Chittagong to Patenga end) of the 3.315-km tunnel) — and the project had achieved a 73% physical completion rate. By November 2021, the project had achieved a 77.5% physical completion rate. On May 8, 2022, Harunur Rashid Chowdhury, Project Director of Karnaphuli Multilane Road Tunnel, sent a letter to the Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA). In it, he noted that Shanghai Port had remained closed since March 2022 due to Covid-19 and the Chinese Government’s zero-tolerance policy had affected project’s progress: ‘It may be noted that […] most of the goods and equipment are being manufactured/procured from Shanghai. Therefore, the closure of the Shanghai Port is causing a delay in shipments. […] The goods and equipment planned to arrive in March [2022] are still not able to reach Chittagong Port to date. Subsequent shipments will also get affected on this account.’ In the letter, Harunur Rashid Chowdhury also asked the BBA to take up the issue with the Economic Relations Division (ERD) and arrange an extension of the China Eximbank loan availability period by six months until May 6, 2023. On May 7, 2022, Li Zheng, the CCCC Project Manager of the Karnaphuli Tunnel Project Site Office, acknowledged in a letter to Harunur Rashid Chowdhury that the delay in shipments from Shanghai was the result of China’s ‘zero Covid’ measures. Then, in June 2022, BBA announced that two sub-contractors hired CCCC to complete two project components — a management software system for BBA and the service area (east) — had violated their contractual obligations. According to a letter from Harunur Rashid Chowdhury, Project Director of Karnaphuli Multilane Road Tunnel, to the BBA, ‘CCCC was instructed to undertake this work, but they employed sub-contractors to do so.  CCCC selected these sub-contractors and is responsible for any default of the sub-contractors. […] Unfortunately, CCCC has not effectively monitored or exercised control over both these sub-contractors.’ The Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project was originally expected to reach completion by the end of 2020. However, in 2018, the project’s expected completion date was pushed back to December 4, 2022.

90073,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,Chinese government provides USD 5 million grant to Kosrae State (Micronesia) to fund road improvements,"On March 11, 2020, the 21st Congress of the Federated States of Micronesia approved a resolution (C.R. No. 21-128, C.D. 1) allocating USD 5 million in grant funds - previously committed by the Chinese government - to the Kosrae State for road improvements.   Per the resolution, more than USD 5 million in Chinese government grants for road improvement projects had previously been allocated to Kosrae on an unspecified date. However, the project in Kosrae for which these funds were allocated ""was never consummated or implemented.""   The specific road improvement project(s) to be financed via the USD 5 million allocated in March 2020 are unknown. It is also unknown whether the funds were committed via one large grant from the Chinese government, or via multiple grants with discretionary elements.","1. It is unknown if the project that captures the original commitment of the funds is already captured in AidData's dataset. This issue warrants further investigation.2. This project may be funded via one or several Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreements (ETCA). This is for several reasons. First, the resolution itself references 'grants' (plural) from the Chinese government that are being pulled from. Second, grants that are unallocated or partially allocated when committed, but later allocated to specific infrastructure projects, are a common financing mechanism associated with ETCAs. Third, there are several ETCAs that were signed by FSM and China for which no evidence about their subsequent allocation exists. However, there is no direct evidence linking this project to a particular ETCA. This issue warrants further investigation.3. There is a risk that the grant captured in this project is being double counted if the original grant from the Chinese government is both (1) in the TUFF dataset and (2) not coded as an umbrella project. However, the chance that the funds referenced were granted via an ETCA (which AidData codes as umbrella projects) is fairly high. Further, if this projects was not funded via an ETCA or similar umbrella grant, AidData cannot identify a project in the TUFF database that is a uniquely likely candidate for the provision of the original funds: a non-ETCA grant which is related to infrastructure construction/sufficiently general to include infrastructure construction, but which is also unallocated to a specific project and/or allocated to a Kosrae State or infrastructure project that never took place. Project ID#69215 and ID#67602 are the only two projects that meet these criteria, and the former is a grant of only 250,000 USD from 2005, while the later is very likely an ETCA. As such, there is a sufficiently low chance that these grant funds are being double counted that this project can be recommended for aggregates.4.

On March 11, 2020, the 21st Congress of the Federated States of Micronesia approved a resolution (C.R. No. 21-128, C.D. 1) allocating USD 5 million in grant funds - previously committed by the Chinese government - to the Kosrae State for road improvements.   Per the resolution, more than USD 5 million in Chinese government grants for road improvement projects had previously been allocated to Kosrae on an unspecified date. However, the project in Kosrae for which these funds were allocated ""was never consummated or implemented.""   The specific road improvement project(s) to be financed via the USD 5 million allocated in March 2020 are unknown. It is also unknown whether the funds were committed via one large grant from the Chinese government, or via multiple grants with discretionary elements.

1. It is unknown if the project that captures the original commitment of the funds is already captured in AidData's dataset. This issue warrants further investigation.2. This project may be funded via one or several Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreements (ETCA). This is for several reasons. First, the resolution itself references 'grants' (plural) from the Chinese government that are being pulled from. Second, grants that are unallocated or partially allocated when committed, but later allocated to specific infrastructure projects, are a common financing mechanism associated with ETCAs. Third, there are several ETCAs that were signed by FSM and China for which no evidence about their subsequent allocation exists. However, there is no direct evidence linking this project to a particular ETCA. This issue warrants further investigation.3. There is a risk that the grant captured in this project is being double counted if the original grant from the Chinese government is both (1) in the TUFF dataset and (2) not coded as an umbrella project. However, the chance that the funds referenced were granted via an ETCA (which AidData codes as umbrella projects) is fairly high. Further, if this projects was not funded via an ETCA or similar umbrella grant, AidData cannot identify a project in the TUFF database that is a uniquely likely candidate for the provision of the original funds: a non-ETCA grant which is related to infrastructure construction/sufficiently general to include infrastructure construction, but which is also unallocated to a specific project and/or allocated to a Kosrae State or infrastructure project that never took place. Project ID#69215 and ID#67602 are the only two projects that meet these criteria, and the former is a grant of only 250,000 USD from 2005, while the later is very likely an ETCA. As such, there is a sufficiently low chance that these grant funds are being double counted that this project can be recommended for aggregates.4. Similar allocations of past unused grant funding can be found in Project ID#90074"
64786,ENERGY,CDB provides $215 million buyer’s credit loan for Vientiane Power Grid Modernization Project,"On November 13, 2017, China Development and the Government of Laos signed a $215 million buyer’s credit loan agreement for the Vientiane Power Grid Modernization Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 90% of the cost of a $239 million commercial (EPC) contract between Huazhong Power International Economic and Trade Co., Ltd. — a subsidiary of China Electric Power Technology Equipment Co., Ltd. — and Electricite du Laos (EDL), which was signed in December 2015. EDL is considered to be the project owner.   The purpose of the project is to reconstruct the 115 kV Donekoy substation (ສະ​ຖາ​ນີ​ໄຟ​ຟ້າ​ດອນກອຍ), the 115 kV Sokpaluang substation (ສະຖານີໄຟຟ້າໂສກປ່າຫລວງ), and the transmission line works (a 40 km 230kV line and a 50 km 500kV line) between the two substations in the capital city of Vientiane.   Huazhong Power International Economic and Trade Co., Ltd. is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Project implementation commenced on April 19, 2019. The project is still under implementation; but on July 24, 2021, the first station of the Laos substation was put online. The expected completion date of the project is April 2022.  There are some indications that the CDB loan for the Vientiane Power Grid Modernization Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. Laos’ gross foreign exchange reserves were dangerously low between 2019 and 2021, hovering between 1.4 and 2.3 months of import cover, and total public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt increased from 68 percent of GDP ($12.5 billion) in 2019 to 88 percent in 2021 of GDP (or $14.5 billion). According to a report published by the World Bank in April 2022, ‘[t]he energy sector, mostly represented by Électricité du Laos (EDL), accounted for over 30 percent of total PPG debt in 2021. […] EDL’s debt service obligations [were] still unsustainable [at the time], with future debt service accounting for about two fifths of EDL’s total operating revenue.’ The Laotian authorities sought and secured debt service payment deferrals from their Chinese creditors in 2020 and 2021; according to the World Bank, ‘[d]ebt service deferrals granted by major lenders in 2020-2021 amounted around 3.6 percent of GDP in 2021’ and ’[a]s a result, actual debt service payments are estimated to have declined to 48 percent of total revenues in 2021, compared to 65 percent in the 2021 [Government of Laos] plan.’  The country’s central bank (Bank of the Lao P.D.R) also made a $300 million drawdown under its currency swap agreement with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in June 2020 — when its gross reserves stood at only 1.5 months of import cover and credit rating agencies warned of a high default probability. Then, in 2021, the short-term emergency loan from the PBOC was ‘rolled over’ for another year. Around the same time, a Chinese state-owned enterprise purchased a major public infrastructure asset in Laos—a large part of the country’s electricity transmission grid—from EDL as part of an apparent debt-for-equity swap. China Southern Power Grid Co. and EDL established a joint venture known as Électricité du Laos Transmission Company Limited (EDLT) in September 2020.  China Southern Power Grid Co. purchased a 90% ownership stake in EDLT in exchange for a $600 million fee (equity infusion). Then, in March 2021, EDLT signed a 25-year concession agreement, which made it responsible for management of the country’s high-voltage transmission network above 230 kilovolts. Independent observers suggested at the time that EDL would likely use the $600 million upfront payment from China Southern Power Grid Co. to service its outstanding debts to Chinese creditors, although this has not been independently confirmed. According to the World Bank’s International Debt Statistics, the Government of Laos was responsible for making average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $232 million between 2019 and 2019 and average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $60 million between 2020 and 2021 (a substantially lower figure due to payment deferrals); however, it expected to make average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth nearly $678 million over the next seven years (2022-2028).",1.

95394,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",CDB provides $100 million loan to Perilya to facilitate its acquisition of Globestar Mining Corporation,"In 2010, China Development Bank and Perilya, Ltd. signed a $100 million long-term facility (loan) agreement.  The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 5-year maturity and an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a margin of 3.3%. It was secured by (i.e. collateralized against) the assets of Cerro de Maimón copper and gold mine operations in the Dominican Republic. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to facilitate its acquisition of Globestar Mining Corporation, a company responsible for the Cerro de Maimón copper-gold mine in the Dominican Republic. By the end of 2010, the CDB loan had achieved a 91.2% disbursement rate ($91.2 million out of $100 million). Perilya made its first principal repayment of US$4.6 million in January 2011. The loan’s outstanding amount was $86.6 million as of December 31, 2011. Perilya, Ltd.’s acquisition of Globestar Mining Corporation was completed in December 2010.   Cerro de Maimón, is an operating copper/gold mine in the Dominican Republic. Cerro de Maimón hosts approximately 6 million tonnes of open-pit copper/gold reserves, as reported in a National Instrument 43-101 compliant technical report dated August 2007 by independent consultants. The Cerro de Maimón property, and surrounding 3,391 hectare exploitation concession, was acquired from Falconbridge Dominicana (Falcondo) in April 2002. Falcondo retained a 2% NSR of which Perilya purchased 50% in 2008. The company owns 100% of the deposit, subject to the remaining 1% NSR retained by Falcondo. The Dominican Secretary of State of Environment and Natural Resources granted the Environmental License to Perilya to mine the Cerro de Maimón mineral deposit in 2004. There is potential for expanding the reserve base of the operation from satellite deposits in Perilya's 100% owned Maimón Concession surrounding the Cerro de Maimón deposit. The Maimón Concession covers approximately 85% of the Maimón massive sulphide belt. operationsOpen pit mining operations Construction of the approximately $69 million open pit mine, processing facilities and related infrastructure began in December 2006 and was completed in October 2008. The operation has separate processing facilities for the sulphide and oxide ores. Copper is recovered from the sulphide ores with co-product gold and silver. The oxide ore is treated to recover gold-silver doré. Mining is done by a contractor using a fleet of articulated trucks, rigid body trucks and hydraulic excavators. The mined ore is sent to the appropriate sulphide or oxide ore stockpiles and waste rock to one of the several waste rock disposal piles on the property. Both the sulphide and oxide plants use the same crushing and conveying system. The two-stage crushing system reduces the ore to minus ¾ inch. The sulphide ore is processed through a 1,300 tonne per day flotation circuit using large capacity circular flotation cells followed by a re-cleaner flotation column. Primary grinding is done with a 12' x 14' ball mill with 80% passing 150 microns. A second 11' x 13' regrind mill grinds the rougher flotation concentrate to 80% passing 35 microns. The overflow from the regrind cyclone passes directly to the cleaner cells before going to the flotation column. The concentrate from the flotation column is then thickened and filtered in order to reduce the final moisture content of the concentrate to about 6%. View of processing facilities at Cerro de Maimón Concentrate is trucked to the port of Río Haina on the southern coast of the Dominican Republic where it is loaded and shipped to customers overseas. The oxide ore is processed via grinding in an 8' x 15' ball mill followed by conventional agitated cyanide leaching, counter current decantation thickening and Merrill-Crowe gold and silver recovery at a rate of 700 tonnes per day. Tailings and potentially acid generating (PAG) waste rock are deposited in a co-disposal facility designed by Golder Associates.   Perilya practices concurrent reclamation at the Cerro de Maimón property. As soon as an affected area is ready for reclamation, previously reserved topsoil is replaced and the area is re-planted with native species grown in the Company's nursery. At mine closure all infrastructure will be removed and affected areas covered with topsoil and re-vegetated. At Cerro de Maimón, Perilya has been working with local government and communities since 2005 in order to meet the Company's environmental and sustainable development objectives. Activities undertaken by Perilya include: Over 80% percent of employees at Cerro de Maimón come from within Monseñor Nouel Province. Perilya is committed to Interior view of sulphide flotation plant building   employment and training of people from local communities. The Fundación Mina Cerro de Maimón (the Cerro de Maimón Mine Foundation) has been established as a non-profit foundation dedicated to improving education and healthcare in the nearby villages of El Copey and Las Martinez. Perilya will provide funding for this foundation and the communities will participate in decisions on distribution of the funds. Improvements to the main access road through the villages of El Copey and Los Martinez. Sponsorship of classes in agriculture, accounting, computer skills, concrete block-laying and cookery and nutrition in the local communities.

Cerro de Maimón hosts approximately 6 million tonnes of open-pit copper/gold reserves, as reported in a National Instrument 43-101 compliant technical report dated August 2007 by independent consultants. The Cerro de Maimón property, and surrounding 3,391 hectare exploitation concession, was acquired from Falconbridge Dominicana (Falcondo) in April 2002. Falcondo retained a 2% NSR of which Perilya purchased 50% in 2008. The company owns 100% of the deposit, subject to the remaining 1% NSR retained by Falcondo. The Dominican Secretary of State of Environment and Natural Resources granted the Environmental License to Perilya to mine the Cerro de Maimón mineral deposit in 2004. There is potential for expanding the reserve base of the operation from satellite deposits in Perilya's 100% owned Maimón Concession surrounding the Cerro de Maimón deposit. The Maimón Concession covers approximately 85% of the Maimón massive sulphide belt. operationsOpen pit mining operations Construction of the approximately $69 million open pit mine, processing facilities and related infrastructure began in December 2006 and was completed in October 2008. The operation has separate processing facilities for the sulphide and oxide ores. Copper is recovered from the sulphide ores with co-product gold and silver. The oxide ore is treated to recover gold-silver doré. Mining is done by a contractor using a fleet of articulated trucks, rigid body trucks and hydraulic excavators. The mined ore is sent to the appropriate sulphide or oxide ore stockpiles and waste rock to one of the several waste rock disposal piles on the property. Both the sulphide and oxide plants use the same crushing and conveying system. The two-stage crushing system reduces the ore to minus ¾ inch. The sulphide ore is processed through a 1,300 tonne per day flotation circuit using large capacity circular flotation cells followed by a re-cleaner flotation column. Primary grinding is done with a 12' x 14' ball mill with 80% passing 150 microns. A second 11' x 13' regrind mill grinds the rougher flotation concentrate to 80% passing 35 microns. The overflow from the regrind cyclone passes directly to the cleaner cells before going to the flotation column. The concentrate from the flotation column is then thickened and filtered in order to reduce the final moisture content of the concentrate to about 6%. View of processing facilities at Cerro de Maimón Concentrate is trucked to the port of Río Haina on the southern coast of the Dominican Republic where it is loaded and shipped to customers overseas. The oxide ore is processed via grinding in an 8' x 15' ball mill followed by conventional agitated cyanide leaching, counter current decantation thickening and Merrill-Crowe gold and silver recovery at a rate of 700 tonnes per day. Tailings and potentially acid generating (PAG) waste rock are deposited in a co-disposal facility designed by Golder Associates.   Perilya practices concurrent reclamation at the Cerro de Maimón property. As soon as an affected area is ready for reclamation, previously reserved topsoil is replaced and the area is re-planted with native species grown in the Company's nursery. At mine closure all infrastructure will be removed and affected areas covered with topsoil and re-vegetated. At Cerro de Maimón, Perilya has been working with local government and communities since 2005 in order to meet the Company's environmental and sustainable development objectives. Activities undertaken by Perilya include: Over 80% percent of employees at Cerro de Maimón come from within Monseñor Nouel Province. Perilya is committed to Interior view of sulphide flotation plant building   employment and training of people from local communities. The Fundación Mina Cerro de Maimón (the Cerro de Maimón Mine Foundation) has been established as a non-profit foundation dedicated to improving education and healthcare in the nearby villages of El Copey and Las Martinez. Perilya will provide funding for this foundation and the communities will participate in decisions on distribution of the funds. Improvements to the main access road through the villages of El Copey and Los Martinez. Sponsorship of classes in agriculture, accounting, computer skills, concrete block-laying and cookery and nutrition in the local communities. Provision of direct support to churches and schools in El Copey and Los Martinez.

On the same day, Électricité du Cambodge (EDC) and Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Under these two agreements, Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. was granted a 45-year concession (40 years of operation and a construction period of 5 years) and it was specified that the electricity generated by Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. — through the Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant — would be sold to EDC at the fixed price of 6.95 US cents per kilowatt-hour. These agreements also specified that, after 40 years of operation, the ownership of the Lower Sesan II dam will be transferred to the Government of Cambodia. On December 12, 2012, the Government of Cambodia also agreed to guarantee the payment (power purchase) obligations of EDC and Cambodia’s Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy to Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd under the PPA and the IA.  The total cost of the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project, which was implemented on a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis, was $978 million and it was financed with a mix of debt and equity. In December 2013, China Development Bank (captured via Project ID#62217), ICBC (captured via Project ID#92481), and Bank of China (captured via Project ID#92483) provided a $781 million debt financing package (with a 17-year maturity and an interest rate of 6.5%) to Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. for the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project. The financing was structured in the 2 tranches: (i) an initial bridge financing with ICBC under a financial leasing structure (the first for an infrastructure project in Cambodia); and (ii) a subsequent project financing by China Development Bank and Bank of China.
