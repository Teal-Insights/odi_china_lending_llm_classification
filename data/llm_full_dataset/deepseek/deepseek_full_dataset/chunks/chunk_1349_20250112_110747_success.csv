It is unclear whether BOC, or any lender for that matter, contributed to both the $1.221 billion USD ECA-covered tranche and the $220 million USD commercial facility tranche. AidData has treated BOC as having contributed to the entire $1.441 billion USD loan; as a result, it has added Euler Hermes and SACE as guarantee agencies, but for the maturity record, it has taken the average of the two maturities (13.5 + 5) / 2, or 6.75, and has coded this as the maturity rate to ensure both tranches are represented.3. The individual contributions of the eight lenders to this $1.441 billion USD loan is unknown. For the time being, AidData has estimated the contribution of BOC by assuming that each lender contributed an equal amount ($180,125,000 USD) to the tranche.","# Sector
