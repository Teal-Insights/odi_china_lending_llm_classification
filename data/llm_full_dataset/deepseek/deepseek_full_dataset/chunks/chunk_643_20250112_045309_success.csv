It is also known that the borrower and project owner — Metalkol SA — pledged all of its assets and some assets of its affiliated companies as sources of collateral.  The Roan Tailings Reclamation (RTR) Project is located 26 km west from Kolwezi.

CNMC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction started in February 2017. The project was originally expected to reach completion within 24 months. It reached full phase 1 production in 2020.","1. The Chinese project title is RTR项目.2. China Eximbank and ICBC likely signed an accounts receivable transfer agreement with CNMC to provide financing for the construction period of the project. In this type of arrangement, the exporter (seller) procures insurance from an insurer and transfers its accounts receivable under the insurance policy to a bank. The bank then grants financing to the exporter (seller) and becomes the insured under the transferred insurance policy. When an insured loss occurs, the insurer pays indemnity to the financing bank pursuant to the insurance policy and the Accounts Receivable Transfer Agreement.3. In a typical receivables financing agreement (or deferred payment agreement), the company that the project owner in the host country has selected as its engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor is also a lender to the project owner. The company assigns receivables under its EPC contract with the project owner to one of or more banks. Upon assignment of receivables, the bank or banks will release funds to the company so it can discharge its obligations under the receivables financing agreement as a lender. Receivables financing is also known as accounts receivable financing (finance) or A/R financing (finance) or 应收账款融资 (in Chinese). These other terms are used because the accounts receivable of a company (i.e., unpaid invoices) are being used as collateral to unlock working capital—typically in the form of a bank loan (‘receivables loan’). Sellers often face cash flow problems when their buyers do not make full payment at the due date of the invoice. A receivables financing arrangement addresses this problem by allowing them to sell their outstanding invoices to a bank at a discounted rate. This approach allows the seller to receive the remaining invoice amount before the due date of the invoice. The bank either gets its money back at invoice maturity through the seller (acting as a collecting agent) or directly from the debtor.4. Several sources refers to the monetary value of the accounts receivable financing facility as $700 million. For the time being, AidData assumes that 85% of the cost of the $654,233,791 EPC contract was financed through the accounts receivables financing facility agreement. This issue warrants further investigation.5. The precise dates on which the accounts receivables financing facility agreement and the deferred payment/on-lending agreement were signed are unknown. For the time being, AidData relies on the project implementation start date (February 2017) as a proxy for the official commitment date. This issue warrants further investigation.","# Sector

Then on January 18, 2016, CMG and the Djibouti Port and Free Trade Zone Authority (DPFZA) held a signing ceremony for a framework agreement for the Djibouti International Free Trade Zone (DIFTZ) Expansion Project. CMG then signed a project contract on January 15, 2017. Three days later, on January 18, 2017, Khor Ambado Free Zone Co. (FZCO or Djibouti Asset Company) — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture between Port of Dalian Authority Group (10% equity stake), China Merchants Shekou Industrial Zone Holdings (招商局蛇口工业区控股股份有限公司) (6% equity stake), China Merchants Investment Development Co., Ltd (CMID) (12% ownership stake), China Merchants Port Holdings Co., Ltd (12% ownership stake), and the Djibouti Ports & Free Zones Authority (DPFZA) (60% equity stake) — was established (legally incorporated) to develop commercial and infrastructure projects within the Djibouti International Free Trade Zone (DIFTZ). Then, on November 10, 2017, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited (CMP) issued a $150 million supplier’s credit (‘CMP Loan Facility’) agreement with Khor Ambado Free Zone Co. for the Djibouti International Free Trade Zone (DIFTZ) Expansion Project. The CMP loan, captured via Project ID#59393, carried the following borrowing terms: a 5% annual interest rate, a 1.25-year maturity (with the option to extend the maturity by 8.75 additional years), and no grace period.   The Government of Djibouti — through the state-owned Djibouti Port and Free Trade Zone Authority (DPFZA) — issued a sovereign guarantee for repaying the supplier's credit. The loan was collateralized by a share pledge over 15.3% of the shares held by Great Horn Investment Holdings SAS (a subsidiary of DPFZA) in a China-Djibouti joint venture called Port De Djibouti S.A., which is co-owned the Government of Djibouti (76.5% equity stake) and China Merchants Port Holdings Company Ltd. (23.5% equity stake). Khor Ambado Free Zone Co. used the supplier's credit (loan) facility to on-lend to Port De Djibouti S.A. (PDSA).  Then, in 2019, China Development Bank and Khor Ambado Free Zone Co. signed a $240 million loan agreement (ID#4430201901100002407) for the Djibouti International Free Trade Zone (DIFTZ) Expansion Project. The CDB loan, which is captured via Project ID#85139, carried the following borrowing terms: a 13 year maturity and a 3 year grace period. China Merchants Shekou Industrial Zone Holdings Co., Ltd. provided a loan guarantee worth $14.4 million (6% of $240 million CDB loan). The Government of Djibouti provided a sovereign guarantee for 60% of the face value of the loan ($144 million). The DIFTZ is a 40-hectare zone that consists of three functional blocks located close to all of Djibouti’s major ports.   The purpose of the DIFTZ is to support industries such as the logistics, marine, construction, automotive, and home electrical industries. It is equipped with advanced facilities including high-speed telecommunications, power and water supplies, roads and parking lots. The pilot zone has four industrial clusters which focus on trade and logistics, export processing and business support: (1) Logistics Industry Cluster: transportation, bonded warehousing, logistics and distribution; (2) Business Industry Cluster: bulk bonded goods transactions, merchandise display, duty-free merchandise retail; (3) Business Support Cluster: financial services, information services, hotel dormitories, office buildings, training, intermediary services; and (4) Processing Manufacturing Cluster: packaging production, light processing of incoming materials, food processing, marine products, auto parts assembly.   China Merchants Holdings (Djibouti) FZE (“CM Djibouti”) was the company responsible for project implementation. On January 16, 2017, Djiboutian President Guelleh and General Manager of China Merchants Group Hu Jianhua unveiled the launch area and laid a foundation stone for the DIFTZ expansion project. The first phase of the project, which involved upgrading and expanding the port facilities of DIFTZ, was officially opened on July 5, 2018.  There are some indications that the $150 million CMP loan for the DIFTZ expansion project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In September 2018, the Government of Djibouti nationalized the Dolareh Container Terminal (DCT), an asset held by PDSA. The change in DCT ownership affected PDSA's expected profits because PDSA's profits included dividend receivables from DCT. As a result, the potential chargeable interest on the CMP loan facility, which would be determined in part by PDSA profits, was rendered invalid. The DCT nationalization also affected DPFZA's share pledge value. On November 9, 2018, CMP extended the loan's final maturity date by another 6 months (as captured via Project ID#97763).","1. This project is also known as Phase 1 of the Djibouti International Free Trade Zone (DIFTZ) Project and Phase 1 of the DIFTZ at PK 23 Project. The Chinese project title is 吉布提国际自贸区于 or 布提自贸区建设项目. 2. The Djibouti Port and Free Trade Zone Authority (DPFZA) is the sole government authority in charge of the administration and the control of all the free zones and ports in Djibouti.3. On March 28, 2019, Khor Ambado Free Zone Co. (FZCO or Djibouti Asset Company) — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture between Port of Dalian Authority Group (10% equity stake), China Merchants Shekou Industrial Zone Holdings (招商局蛇口工业区控股股份有限公司) (6% equity stake), China Merchants Investment Development Co., Ltd (CMID) (12% ownership stake), China Merchants Port Holdings Co., Ltd (12% ownership stake), and the Djibouti Ports & Free Zones Authority (DPFZA) (60% equity stake) — entered into a land lease agreement (the “Land Lease Agreement”) with China Merchants Holdings (Djibouti) FZE (“CM Djibouti”), a subsidiary of China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited, pursuant to which the Djibouti Asset Company as lessor would sub-lease a parcel of land with an area of 137,801.63 square meters within the Djibouti International Free Trade Zone (the “Djibouti Lease Land”) to CM Djibouti as lessee, for a term commencing on the date of the Land Lease Agreement and ending on August 14, 2116. The Lease Land shall be used for the purposes of carrying out logistics, commerce and trade activities within the Djibouti International Free Trade Zone. CM Djibouti shall pay to the Djibouti Asset Company (i) an aggregate amount of $27,756,004.31 (equivalent to approximately HK$216,497,000) for the full term of the Lease, (ii) a deposit of US$200,000 (equivalent to approximately HK$1,560,000) in addition to the rent and (iii) property management fees at an annual rate of US$1.00 (equivalent to approximately HK$7.80) per square meter of the surface area of the Djibouti Lease Land. The Djibouti Asset Company is an associate of CMG, the ultimate holding company of China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited. 4. Under the BRI banner, Chinese SOEs, especially China Merchants Group (CMG), have been attempting to replicate elements of its “port in front-(industrial) park in the middle-city behind” or Port-Park-City (PPC) model in Africa. The model is based on the Shekou Industrial Park in Shenzhen city in China’s Guangdong Province, established in 1979. It was the country’s first special economic zone, and it sparked Shenzhen’s growth as a commercial and industrial hub. CMG’s efforts to build the village of Shekou into a world-class industrial zone resulted in an area without basic infrastructure being transformed into a modern metropolitan center. The Shekou Model “entails developing adjacent industrial parks, commercial buildings, highways, free trade zones, residential areas, and power plants.” With the focus on the port, the model does not aim only to facilitate the transportation of goods but to “develop a larger, integrated system that helps sustain the port and is sustained by it in turn”. In 2017, Li Xiaopeng, president of CMG, mentioned that his company is using the Shekou Model as a template or a concept that can be applied and tweaked to adjust to its port projects worldwide. 5. For the time being, AidData has estimated the annual interest rate that applied to the November 2017 CMP facility (loan) as 5%. However, the interest rate was in fact to be determined by the highest of two rates: (1) a 5% per annum interest rate on the outstanding loan amount, or (2) 50% of the interest payable by PDSA to Khor Ambado Free Zone Company (FZCO) in the relevant year.","# Sector

The pilot zone has four industrial clusters which focus on trade and logistics, export processing and business support: (1) Logistics Industry Cluster: transportation, bonded warehousing, logistics and distribution; (2) Business Industry Cluster: bulk bonded goods transactions, merchandise display, duty-free merchandise retail; (3) Business Support Cluster: financial services, information services, hotel dormitories, office buildings, training, intermediary services; and (4) Processing Manufacturing Cluster: packaging production, light processing of incoming materials, food processing, marine products, auto parts assembly.   China Merchants Holdings (Djibouti) FZE (“CM Djibouti”) was the company responsible for project implementation. On January 16, 2017, Djiboutian President Guelleh and General Manager of China Merchants Group Hu Jianhua unveiled the launch area and laid a foundation stone for the DIFTZ expansion project. The first phase of the project, which involved upgrading and expanding the port facilities of DIFTZ, was officially opened on July 5, 2018.  There are some indications that the $150 million CMP loan for the DIFTZ expansion project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In September 2018, the Government of Djibouti nationalized the Dolareh Container Terminal (DCT), an asset held by PDSA. The change in DCT ownership affected PDSA's expected profits because PDSA's profits included dividend receivables from DCT. As a result, the potential chargeable interest on the CMP loan facility, which would be determined in part by PDSA profits, was rendered invalid. The DCT nationalization also affected DPFZA's share pledge value. On November 9, 2018, CMP extended the loan's final maturity date by another 6 months (as captured via Project ID#97763).",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,General Infrastructure,"Project focuses on developing a free trade zone with various industrial clusters and infrastructure, without clear direct environmental or energy transition impacts","Development of 40-hectare free trade zone with logistics, business, and processing clusters; includes infrastructure like roads, parking, and utilities but no specific energy transition components"

59548,GOVERNMENT AND CIVIL SOCIETY,Chinese Government provides $20 million USD grant for Urban Security Monitoring System Project (Linked to Project ID#88678),"In 2006, amidst regional instability and terrorism, President of Djibouti Ismaïl Omar Guelleh ordered Djibouti's National Security Agency to conduct a feasibility study on a modern surveillance system for Djibouti City and the surrounding region. Then, on December 3, 2015, on the sidelines of the Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FSCA) held in Johannesburg, South Africa, Chinese President Xi Jinping and President Guelleh discussed the establishment of a framework for the implementation of a Chinese-installed video camera surveillance system. Then, on January 24, 2017 and February 2, 2017, the Chinese Government and the Government of Djibouti signed an exchange of letters in which the Chinese Government committed $20 million USD in grant funding to Djibouti for the Urban Security Monitoring System Project. China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) was the specific Chinese Government institution responsible for providing this grant.  A project management team had visited Djibouti for inspection work on July 18 to August 5, 2017. On December 5, 2017, MOFCOM released a tender notice for the project, which noted that the project had a planned start date in the third quarter of 2018 (between July 1 and September 30, 2018) with a planned construction period of 18 months (between January 1 and March 30, 2020). The contractor, a Chinese company, would work under an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC contract), as well as provide two years of training and maintenance services and one year of technical support after the handover (for the MOFCOM tender notice, see ""采购招标公告""). China Railway Construction Group won the contract for the project in April 2018; it sent a technical team to carry out studies the same month. Then, in May 2018, China hosted a one-month long seminar and training on surveillance camera systems for 29 Djiboutian public security agents (see linked project ID#88678). In July 2018, a Djiboutian technical team finalized and signed an agreement for the project during a visit to China.  The surveillance system — consisting of 600-800 surveillance (CCTV) cameras with facial recognition technology — was set to cover Djibouti City and extend from Loyada to PK20. Similar projects at the Galiley, Galafi, and Balho border crossing were also planned. The security command center, controlled by Djibouti's security agencies, was constructed on a 3000 square plot offered by the Djibouti Republican Guard in Djibouti City. The camera terminal was designed with solar panels, while all signal transmission was designed to be back transmitted using microwave wireless networks for flexibility, security, and reliability. Additionally, the project included a new main dispatch command center system, along with two backup sets. Through a multi-mode access network capable of sorting and saving audio and video data, the system was designed to manage Djibouti's police operations. The surveillance system covered urban areas, airports, terminals, ports, and other spots of interest throughout Djibouti City was expected to provide the safety of Djibouti, including Chinese enterprises. China Railway Electrification Bureau (Group) Co., Ltd. (EEB) and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. were responsible for project implementation. BUCEA Jingjing Dafang Engineering Management Co., Ltd. was responsible for project management.  Work on the security command center began on September 27, 2018, in a ceremony attended by Prime Minister of Djibouti Abdoulkader Kamil Mohamed. The project passed mid-term inspection after a visit from a project supervision team from MOFCOM from May 20 to May 30, 2019.
