On March 31, 2015, Star Bulk Carriers Corp., a shipping company organized under the laws of the Republic of Marshall Islands, entered into an agreement with DNB Bank ASA as facility agent, security agent account bank, and book runner, DNB Bank ASA and the Export-Import Bank of China (CEXIM) as mandated lead arrangers and DNB Bank ASA, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (SEB) and CEXIM as original lenders (the “DNB-SEB-CEXIM $227.5 million Facility”) for up to $227.5 million to partially finance the construction cost of seven new building vessels, Gargantua (ex-HN166), Goliath (ex-HN167), Maharaj (ex-HN184), Star Poseidon (ex-HN198), Star Aries (ex-HN1338), Star Taurus (ex-HN1339), and Star Eleni (HN1342). The financing is available in seven separate tranches, one for each new vessel. This Project ID#63138 records the third tranche of $30.3 million for the financing of Maharaj (ex-HN184).
