The acquisition of the Delphin vessels stemmed from a May 27, 2019 en bloc definitive agreement in which Star Bulk acquired the ships for an aggregate of 4,503,370 of its common shares (cost of shares being calculated by Star Bulk's closing share market prices on the delivery date of each vessel) and a cash consideration of $80 million USD for the total acquisition cost of $127.532 million USD. CMBF's lease financed the cash consideration portion of the acquisition. Per the terms of each bareboat charter for each vessel, Star Bulk would pay CMBL a fixed bareboat charter hire rate in quarterly installments plus interest, and Star Bulk would have the option to purchase each vessel beginning one year after each vessel's delivery to Star Bulk for a pre-determined, amortizing purchase price. Star Bulk had the obligation to purchase each vessel at the expiration of the respective bareboat term at a price ranging from $975,000 USD to $3,379,000 USD.
