China Eximbank provides $434.5 million preferential buyer’s credit for the 415 km Kalbatau-Maykapshagai Road Reconstruction Project (Linked to Project ID#54989, #54991, and #55016)

# Description
On May 15, 2017, the Export-Import Bank of China and JSC KazAutoZhol National Company Joint Stock Company (JSC NC KazAvtoZhol or азАвтоЖол)— a Kazakh state-owned transportation company — signed a $434.5 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the 415 km Kalbatau-Maykapshagai Road Reconstruction Project. The PBC carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, 5-year grace period, and a 20-year maturity. The Government of Kazakhstan provided a sovereign guarantee for the loan. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $511 million commercial (EPC) contract between China Xinxing Construction and Development Co. Ltd (Xinxing Construction) and KazAutoZhol.  The purpose of the project is to upgrade a 415 km road that runs from the village of Kalbatau and the checkpoint Maykapshagai on the border with China in the East Kazakhstan region. Xinxing Construction (211 km in total) and JV KazGerStroy LLP (204 km in total) were the general EPC contractors responsible for implementation. However, China General Technology Group (Genertec) is also involved in implementation. Quality control of the work performed is carried out by YuVPEC-Astana LLP. As of December 2021, 127 km of roads had been covered with new asphalt concrete pavement.  Construction began in May 2019 and the project was originally expected to reach completion in June 2022. However, it has encountered several implementation problems, including the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase in the cost of road construction materials, and contractor performance problems. In October 2021, Xinxing Construction completed one of the eight road sections (measuring 43.228 in length).",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,General Infrastructure,Road reconstruction project with no clear environmental or energy transition impacts,"415 km road upgrade project, general transportation infrastructure"
