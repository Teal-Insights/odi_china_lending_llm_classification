91448,HEALTH,ICBC Argentina provides donation of ARS 23.6 million to Argentina to fight COVID-19 in April 2020,"In April 2020, ICBC Argentina provided a donation of ARS 23.6 million to several Argentine agencies and organizations to help fight COVID-19. The funds will be used to buy hospital equipment, population monitoring, health kits, and food. ICBC Argentina subsequently launched a fundraising campaign for the same organizations, soliciting funds from employees, customers, and members of the public.  The recipients of the donation include Argentina Nos Necesita, Una Sola Hinchada, Seamos Uno, Garrahan Pediatric Hospital, Cooperadora de Acción Social (COAS), Center for Medical Education and Clinical Research (CEMIC), and the Argentine Ministry of Health.","1. Una Sola Hinchado is a campaign of GDFE Argentina and so GDFE is listed as a receiving agency.2. The transaction amount has been recorded as ARS 23.6 million because this is the most conservative estimate from an official source. However, one ICBC source indicates the transaction amount of the donation from April 2020 was ARS 30,590,000. A Sina article reports the transaction amount for all of its donation programs was ARS 22 million. Lastly, another ICBC article published in May 2020 reports a 'more than' ARS 30 million donation. It is possible that (1) the donation increased to ARS 30,590,000 following the continued donation campaign from ICBC Argentina (meaning the additional funds came from private donors, rather than ICBC itself, and the more conservative ARS 23.6 million number correctly represents the ICBC donation), (2) the donation portion that came from ICBC Argentina was only ARS 22 million, and the remainder came from the continued campaign, (3) an additional ARS 6.99 million was donated by ICBC Argentina at the end of April, (4) another ARS 30,590,000 was donated in addition to the ARS 23.6 million. This issue warrants further investigation.3. This project was previously linked to #91451, which captured a potential second donation to the same recipients from ICBC Argentina due to the multiple transaction amounts reported. However, it has been deactivated insofar as the two donations would have to be extremely similar, and there is a very high chance that the follow-up articles represented updates to the donation campaign – and thus the additional grant funds came from private donors – rather than a second donation from ICBC Argentina. This is additionally supported by Sina's reporting in late May 2020 that only ARS 22 million had been donated, as well as the lack of specific handover dates or language about where funds were coming from.4. Although one ICBC article regarding the April 2020 donation lists only Argentina Nos Necesita, Una Sola Hinchada, Seamos Uno, and the Ministry of Health (and 'others') as the recipients, the other ICBC article adds the Garrahan Hospital, COAS, and CEMIC also as recipients of the April donation.

91463,HEALTH,Sinopharm contributes to first batch of medical supplies donated to Argentina in March 2020 (linked to #91387),"On March 17, 2020 – at a meeting between the Chinese Ambassador to Argentina, Zou Xiaoli, and the President of Argentina, Alberto Fernández – the Chinese Embassy committed a batch of supplies to the Argentine Government to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. The supplies were to be granted by a group of organizations consisting primarily of Chinese government institutions and state-owned enterprises.    The entire batch included the following supplies: 5,000 sets of protective clothing, 66,000 N95 masks, 130,000 medical masks, 2,000 goggles, 5,000 isolation suits, 20,000 pairs of gloves, 2,500 reagents (testing kits), 550 hand-held forehead thermometers, and 3 sets of temperature monitoring equipment.  The group of donors included the following organizations: the Hangzhou Municipal People's Government; the Xiaoshan District People's Government; the People's Government of Louta Town, (in the Xiaoshan District, Hangzhou Municipality); the China Shenzhen Mammoth Foundation; the BGI Group; the Chinese Embassy in Argentina; the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Argentina Branch; Bank of China, Buenos Aires Branch; COFCO Argentina Branch; China Communications Group, Argentina Branch; National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm); Huawei Argentina; Goldwind Technology, Argentina Branch; and the Argentina-China Trade and Investment Promotion Association.  The materials granted by each donor arrived on different dates. However, the date on which the materials granted by Sinopharm were handed over is unknown. AidData estimates that Sinopharm's contribution was worth about USD 6285.36, or, in terms of supplies, about 3,200 N95 masks, 394 isolation suits, 3,700 pairs of gloves, and 90 thermometers.","1. For the donors that are listed as contributors to this first batch of materials but provided an unknown number of supplies, AidData has applied the equal contribution assumption. The amount that can be directly attributed to a particular donor has been subtracted out from the total, and the value of the remaining supplies has been divided equally between the remaining donors.Five total donors had an unknown contribution: Louta Town Government (#93424), China Communications Group Argentina (#93457), Sinopharm (#91463), Goldwind Technology Argentina (less than 50% Chinese state ownership, no project created), and Argentina-China Trade & Investment Promotion Association (includes an unknown mix of private/state-owned enterprises, AidData does not currently track these types of organizations as projects). Therefore, the value of the unaccounted for supplies has been divided by five.2. Although the majority of the donation is said to have been provided by the Hangzhou Municipal Government, the Xiaoshan District Government, and the Louta Town Government, there is no non-arbitrary mechanism to decide how to increase the estimated contribution for Louta Town. Thus, the equal contribution assumption has still been applied for consistency. However, this does indicate that the number of supplies donated by Sinopharm in this project may be inflated to some extent, as will the estimates listed for China Communications Group, Goldwind Technology Argentina, and Argentina-China Trade & Investment Promotion Association. 3. The calculations for the portion of the donation provided by Sinopharm are as follows:5,000 sets of protective clothing - 3,500 donated by ICBC Argentina (#93425) - 1,500 donated by Bank of China Buenos Aires (# 93427) = 0 sets of protective clothing66,000 N95 masks - 50,000 N95 masks donated by Hangzhou Municipal Government (#93423) = 16,000 N95 masks130,000 medical masks - 60,000 donated by Xiaoshan District Government (#93456) - 105,000 donated by Hangzhou Municipal Government (#93423) = -35,000 surgical masks.

AidData estimates these remaining supplies are worth USD 31,426.80 based on price catalogues from the World Health Organization (Please see the TUFF Methodology for additional details). This total has been divided by the number of donors whose contributions are unknown (five) under the assumption that each made an equal contribution. Thus, the value of Sinopharm's estimated contribution is USD 6285.36. ($31,426.80 / 5 = 6285.36)4. Sinopharm also provided supplies that were purchased by the Government of Argentina; this project should not be confused with those purchases.","# Sector

The Catholic University of Chile's Asian Studies Center estimated the donation's value at USD 18,500, and the Buenos Aires Government resolution identifies the materials' value as USD 12,585. However, AidData has coded the transaction amount as the number provided by the Rosario Municipal Government source insofar as (1) it is an official source, (2) it likely includes the transport costs that were covered by the Shanghai Municipal Government, and (3) it provides the donation value in RMB. It therefore likely provides a more accurate estimate for the donation's total value, rather than just the value of the supplies themselves.2.

Given the extremely similar nature of the donation (the materials, brands, amounts, timing between Rosario beginning the process and arrival, same donor), it is possible that this acceptance by Buenos Aires is a procedural step of some kind - insofar as the donation to Rosario would have arrived in Buenos Aires originally - and the resolution is referring to the same donation that eventually went to Rosario. At the same time, there is additional evidence that these are separate donations, catalogued in Project ID#94679. This issue warrants further investigation.3.
