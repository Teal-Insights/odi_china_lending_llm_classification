A pre-export finance (PXF) facility is an arrangement in which a commodity producer gets up-front cash from a customer in return for a promise to repay the customer with that commodity (possibly at a discount) in the future. PXF funds may be advanced by a lender or syndicate of lenders to a commodity producer to assist the company in meeting either its working capital needs (for example, to cover the purchase of raw materials and costs associated with processing, storage and transport) or its capital investment needs (for example, investment in plant and machinery and other elements of infrastructure). PXF facilities are usually secured by (1) an assignment of rights by the producer under an ‘offtake contract’ (i.e., a sale and purchase contract between the producer and a buyer of that producer of goods or commodities), and (2) a collection account charge over a bank account into which proceeds due to the producer from the buyer of the goods or commodities under the offtake contract are credited. There are two key documents in prepayment finance transactions: a contract providing for the advance payment by the offtaker to the producer for the purchase of goods/commodities (the 'Prepayment Contract'), and a loan agreement between a lender and the offtaker (the 'Offtaker Loan Agreement') under which the advance payment is financed.","# Sector

The purpose of the project was to evacuate electricity from the Coca Codo Sinclair hydroelectric power plant and the Sopladora hydroelectric power plant, both of which were constructed with financial support from China Eximbank (captured via Project ID#38935 and Project ID#35818). The project had four objectives: (1) construction of a 500kV transmission line that runs from the Coca Codo Sinclair substation to the San Rafael substation and the El Inga substation in Quito within Pichincha province; (2) construction of a 500kV transmission line that runs from the Chorrillos substation (in Guayaquil within Guayas province) to the Tisaleo substation (in Tungurahua province) and the El Inga substation in Quito; (3) construction of a 230kV transmission line that runs from the Blower substation to the Taday substation and the Taura substation; and (4) construction of a 230kV transmission line that runs from the San Rafael substation to the Jivino substation and the Shushufindi substation.   Harbin Electric Company Limited was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Project implementation commenced in 2013 but was temporarily halted in May 2016. During the project’s peak construction period, it generated 4,200 local jobs. The project was officially completed on June 13, 2019. A temporary project handover certificate was issued on November 22, 2019. A final project handover certificate was issued on November 20, 2020.
