(50% ownership stake) — signed an EPC contract with Shanghai Electric Power Construction Co. Ltd. for the 1336 (2 x 668) MW Dinginin Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project. China Eximbank and Sinosure representatives attended the EPC contract signing ceremony. Then, on September 5, 2016, GNPD signed a $1 billion syndicated loan agreement with China Eximbank and other Chinese lenders for the first power generation unit of the 1336 (2 x 668) MW Dinginin Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project. The borrower purchased a credit insurance policy from Sinosure. On December 6, 2017, GNPD signed an additional $1.7 billion (PHP 22 billion) syndicated loan agreement with a group of Filipino banks for the second power generation unit of the 1336 (2 x 668) MW Dinginin Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project.   The purpose of the project is to construct a 1.3GW supercritical, coal-fired power project — with two 668 MW power generation units — in the Bataang Peninsula of Philippines. The Dinginin coal-fired power project is located at the entrance of Manila Bay, in Dinginin, approximately 5km away from Mariveles city, in the Bataan Peninsula of Philippines. The project site covers approximately 60 hectares and lies adjacent to the CDB-financed 600MW Mariveles power plant. The Dinginin power plant consists of two supercritical, pulverised coal-fired units of 668MW capacity each. Each block is equipped with a flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) system to control emissions. The other components of the plant include high-pressure and low-pressure heaters, distributed control system (DCS), transformers, circuit breakers, gas insulated switchyard, dual optical ground wire power transmission cable, coal mills, coal handling system, auxiliary seawater cooling water pumps, and condensate water pumps. The project utilizes an 80,000t coal terminal, along with two 120m-diameter circular coal yards. The electricity generated by the Dinginin coal-fired power project will be evacuated to the grid through a double-circuit 500kV power transmission line.   Shanghai Electric Power Construction Co.
