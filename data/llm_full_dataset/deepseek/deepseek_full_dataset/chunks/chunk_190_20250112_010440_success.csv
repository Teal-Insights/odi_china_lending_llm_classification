As part of DSSI, China Eximbank and the Government of Fiji signed a ('EXIM China Debt Service Suspension Initiative I') debt suspension agreement on September 23, 2020. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between May 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under six government concessional loan agreements for the E-Government Project, the Low Cost Housing Project, the Fiji Public Rental Housing Project, the Buca Bay Moto Road Project, the Sigatoka Sawani Road Project, and the Nabouwalu Dreketi Road Project (captured via Project ID#62721, 62576, 62719, 49134, 40003, and 64738).  The total estimated suspension amount is unknown (but was no more than RMB 144.6 million). However, at the time that the parties signed the debt suspension agreement, they both acknowledged that the total suspension amount would ultimately be determined at the end of the suspension period (since loan disbursements could be made during the suspension period and the lender agreed to suspend the payment of interest accrued on any disbursements during the suspension period). The lender and borrower agreed that the suspension of debt service would be undertaken on a net present value (NPV)-neutral basis. Therefore, the borrower agreed to pay interest accrued on the amount outstanding under the total suspension amount (‘Suspension Interest’) by paying the Suspension Interest on the amount outstanding under each loan agreement’s suspension amount at the same rate of interest set forth in the original loan agreement.    Under the terms of the debt suspension agreement, the lender and the borrower agreed that the repayment of the suspension amount for each loan agreement would take place during a 2.75-year repayment period after a 1.66-year grace period (starting from and including the repayment date/repayment date of principal and interest falling within the suspension period). The final repayment date for the suspension amount was as September 21, 2024. The lender and the borrower also agreed that ‘[t]he suspension interest on the amount outstanding under the Suspension Amount concerning each Loan Agreement shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and a year of 360 days, from and including the Repayment Date/Repayment Date of Principal and Interest falling within the Suspension Period to the date of payment in full of the corresponding Suspension Amount, and shall be paid in arrears on each Interest Payment Date under the corresponding Loan Agreement.’   The borrower also agreed that (1) ‘it shall continue to perform all its obligations […] under the Loan Agreements as supplemented and amended by [the debt suspension agreement]’; (2) ‘it shall use the created fiscal space to increase social, health, or economic spending in response to the COVID-19 crisis […]’ and ‘work closely with the International Financial Institutions who are expected to put in place a monitoring system’;  (3) ‘it shall disclose to the Lender all Public Sector Financial Commitments (as defined in the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 (GFSM2014)), respecting commercially sensitive information’; and (4) ‘it shall contract no new non-concessional debt during the Suspension Period, other than agreements under the DSSI’.  The borrower began making principal and interest payments on the suspension amount in 2022 and 2023. The suspension amount outstanding was RMB 36,362,247.97 (FJD 11,340,875.14) as of June 30, 2023. The borrower made principal payments worth RMB 24,241,498.64 (FJD 876,391.49) and interest payments worth RMB 1,107.028.44 (FJD 359,618.18) between July 1, 2022 and June 30, 2023.","1.

The purpose of this $2 billion loan facility was to finance large development projects in Africa between 2014 and 2024. The AGTF is sponsored by the PBOC and the administered by AfDB. Then, on March 17, 2020, AGTF signed an EUR 44,839,000 loan agreement with the Government of Gabon for the Infrastructure Sector Support Project - Phase I (PASIG-1). On the same day, the African Development Bank’s African Development Fund (AfDB) issued an EUR 92.778 million loan to the Government of Gabon for the same project. The borrowing terms of the AGTF loan are as follows: an 25-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month EURIBOR plus a 1% margin, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% upfront (management) fee.   The project consists mainly of: (a) construction and asphalting of the Ndendé-Doussala road section (49 km) and the border bridge over the Ngongo River; (b) construction and asphalting of 21,280 km of roads in Libreville, including related developments (sanitation, street lighting, beautification); and (c) detailed sector and technical studies to feed a substantial pipeline of transformative projects in the road subsector. The project is part of the Trans-Gabonese corridor development scheme expected to link Libreville to Mayumba in the South, and crosses timber, mining, metallurgy, agro-industry, fishing, livestock and ecotourism hubs, among others. However, developing the economic potential in the project impact area, which is limited to Ngounié Province, is currently undermined by the poor state of transport infrastructure. The main expected outcomes include improved logistics chain service on this road axis as well as mobility and living conditions for people in the PIA. The project will reduce travel distances by increasing the access rate to basic services for residents of the PIA.
