Then, on April 15, 2020, the two government signed an exchange of letters for the 2023 Pacific Games Stadium Construction Project. China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) reportedly committed $53 million of grant funding for the project. Then, on October 7, 2021, the Government of the Solomon Islands and the Government of the People’s Republic of China signed an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA), which officially committed an unknown amount of grant funding for an unspecified set of projects.  The purpose of the project is to construct a 10,000-seat National Stadium, a 50-meter competition pool and a 25-meter pool at the Aquatic Center (to host swimming competitions), a Tennis Court with a Supporting Tennis Center, a 1200 square meter office building and food court, a new replacement track & field with 4 practice lanes and football pitch (‘secondary stadium’) to be used when the current track and field is closed, an artificial hockey field, and a larger 90-meter x 50-meter multipurpose hall.
