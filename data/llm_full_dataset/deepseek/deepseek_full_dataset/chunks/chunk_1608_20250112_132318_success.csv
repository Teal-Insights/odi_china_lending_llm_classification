The proceeds of the loan were used to finance a commercial contract between Togo Cellulaire and Chinese company Alcatel Shanghai Bell Co, Ltd.. Phase 2 sought to improve Togo Cellulaire's mobile coverage in the city of Lomé, north Togo, and remote areas of the country, improving communications in Togo and helping meet the growing demand for mobile communication from the Togolese people.

This project is also known as Phase 2 of the Telecom Network Expansion Project. The Chinese project title is 多哥移动二期扩容项目 or 多哥移动公司(多哥移动)二期项目. 2. For the time being, AidData identifies the Government of Togo as the borrower. However, there are some indications that Togo Cellulaire (Togocel), which was wholly owned by the Government of Togo until 2019 and is now co-owned by Axian Group & Emerging Capital (51% equity stake) and the Government of Togo (49% equity stake), may be been the primary borrower or secondary borrower (through an on-lending arrangement with the Government of Togo). This issue merits further investigation.3.  Togo Cellulaire (also known as Togocel or Togo Mobile) was a wholly state-owned company and subsidiary of Togo Telecom. At the time, its network covered 90% of the country and had a portfolio of 300,000 subscribers.4.

The loan agreement (captured in Project ID#37616) was signed by Zhao Wenzhang, Deputy Governor of China Eximbank, and Siosiua ‘Utoikamanu, Tonga’s Minister of Finance. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: a 2.5% interest rate and a 15 year maturity.   Tonga’s Ministry of Finance on-lent the proceeds of the loan to Janfull International Dateline Hotel Ltd., a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of the Chinese Government and the Government of Tonga (see Staff Note 3). The on-lending agreement was also signed on June 11, 2001. The Government of Tonga also issued a sovereign guarantee in support of this loan to Janfull International Dateline Hotel Ltd.

Construction ended on July 2, 2003.   Then, in April 2006, China Eximbank and the Government of Tonga signed an RMB 38 million government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for Phase 2 of the International Dateline Hotel Renovation Project (captured in Project ID#63641).

China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) was the contractor responsible for the implementation of Phase 2. Construction began on July 3, 2006. The Fa’onelua Convention Center portion of the project was completed and handed over on January 11, 2007. The project as a whole was completed on September 20, 2007.

It was jointly owned by Janfull Group (51% ownership stake) and International Dateline Hotel Ltd. (49% ownership stake). Janfull Group was owned by China’s Ministry of Commerce and International Dateline Hotel Ltd. was owned by the Government of Tonga. This joint venture is captured in Project ID#42192. In August 2010, the Government of Tonga announced its intent to dissolve the joint venture, citing differences with Janfull Group (a Chinese state-owned enterprise). At the time, the hotel was performing ‘well below international standards’, according to an ADB report. In June 2011, Tonga’s Minister of Public Enterprises successfully applied to have the joint venture placed into liquidation by a court. This move was designed to allow the Government of Tonga to regain control of the hotel—once it had proven its loan to the liquidator’s satisfaction—and then seek private investment or ownership to reestablish the hotel as a high-quality accommodation facility. The Government of Tonga purchased Janfull Group’s 51% ownership stake in Janfull International Dateline Hotel Ltd. after settling unpaid debts (worth $11 million) to China Eximbank. The Government of Tonga then asked the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to served as a transaction advisor and structure, and competitively tender and award a project for the rehabilitation and operation of the International Dateline Hotel on a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) basis. After longer-than-anticipated negotiations, a long-term management concession agreement was signed with an international hotel operator – Tanoa Group – who completely redeveloped the hotel. As of late 2016, the hotel reopened. There have been no further costs to the Government of Tonga since the concession agreement was signed; the hotel is now the largest in Tonga, and a high-quality (4.5 star) hotel. Occupancy rates were estimated at 39% in April 2017.The concession loan for Phase 1 was likely denominated in RMB. However, AidData has only managed to identify the USD equivalent of the face value of the loan. This issue requires further investigation.China Foreign Construction Corporation, Guangsha Chongqing Construction (Group) Co., Ltd., China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), Jiangsu Construction Group Corp., Hunan Construction Engineering Group Corporation, China National Overseas Engineering Corporation, Qingdao Construction Group Corporation were all invited to tender, but CCECC won the contract for Phase 2.","# Sector

In 2002, the Chinese Government provided an RMB 33 million grant to the Government of Tonga for Phase 1 of the Tonga High School Reconstruction Project (captured via Project ID#39243). The purpose of the project was to reconstruct the Tonga High School complex in the city of Nukuʻalofa. The project involved the construction of six buildings (including one three-story block and five two story blocks), a schoolyard, roads, a fire reservoir (including an underground conservation pool), and water and power supply utilities. Three of the buildings were designed to house 54 classrooms. The project also involved the construction of a separate administration office and reading room, as well as two other blocks for special classrooms for science laboratory and industrial arts.

A Chinese team provided a geological survey of the site to ensure favorable conditions for construction. Then, on October 9, 2003, a groundbreaking ceremony took place. Somewhere between 86 and 110 Chinese workers were involved in the construction process. The school was completed and handed over in April 6, 2005. Tonga High School students moved into their permanent facility on July 2, 2005.   Then, on February 6, 2006, the Chinese Government donated $590,000 worth of furniture and equipment to Tonga High School, including 1710 sets of tables & chairs for students, 34 sets of office furniture, 142 sets of bookshelves, and 75 sets of teacher’s tables and experiment tables (as captured via Project ID#39228). China’s Ambassador to Tonga Hu Yeshun and the Education Minister of Tonga Tevita Palefau officiated at the handover ceremony. The Chinese Government also dispatched a Chinese language teacher to Tonga High School from 2003-2005 (as captured via Project ID#39239).  Shortly after Phase 1 was completed, discussions were underway about a possible second phase for the construction of an indoor gymnasium, an outdoor rugby field, four outdoor netball courts, an aquatics center, a lawn bowling field, a tennis court, a hall for the performing arts, and accommodations for teachers (with a total area of 9,180 square meters). In April 2006, the Chinese Government and the Government of Tonga signed an agreement regarding Phase 2 of the Tonga High School Reconstruction Project. A team from Hunan Provincial Institute of Architectural Design conducted an initial set of geological surveys and completed them on or around September 16, 2006 (as recorded in Project ID#62983). They confirmed that the proposed project site was stable and suitable for construction. Then, after several years of inactivity, the Government of Tonga revealed in its 2012 Budget Report that the Chinese Government had provide a TOP 13 million grant for the design of Phase 2 (as recorded in Project ID#65917).   In October 2012, Tonga agreed to host the 2019 Pacific Games and the sports facilities at Tonga High School were intended to be one of the locations for the game's events. In December 2016, the Chinese Government and the Government of Tonga signed an exchange of letters, committing grant funding for Phase 2 of the Tonga High School Reconstruction Project.   Then, in March 2017, a Chinese design team visited Tonga for 27 days to finalize plans for the project. The team was led by a Mr Zi Ling, and met with the Chairman of Tonga 2019 Pacific Games Organizing Committee, Lord Sevele, working out of the Tonga Sports Association and National Olympic Committee (TASNOC). On April 15, 2017, the Chinese Government and the Government of Tonga signed as project implementation agreement, which provided TOP 55 million ($24.8 million USD) of grant funding for Phase 2 (as recorded in Project ID#49242). The grant proceeds were apparently drawn from at least two Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreements (ETCAs) that the two governments signed on November 23, 2015 and December 8, 2017 (as captured in Project ID#49235 and ID#62890).   Only a month later (May 2017), Tonga withdrew its offer to host the 2019 Pacific Games, citing that sports development was no longer of the government's priorities. However, the Chinese Government-financed design plans were finalized in November 2017 and the Chinese Government reaffirmed on December 8, 2017 that it would provide TOP 57.5 million of grant funding for the implementation of Phase 2 (as recorded in Project ID#62890). By the time the Government of Tonga published its 2018-2019 Budget Report, the Tongan authorities had revised their cost estimate of the sporting facilities to $70 million USD, but no additional financial commitments appear to have been made to cover the additional project cost.   As of December 2020, Phase 2 construction activities had not yet begun. Nor is there any record of a Chinese Government grant disbursement for Phase 2 from 2015 onwards.","The Chinese project title is 援汤加中学项目 or 援汤首都中学项目.

Phase 2 of the Tonga High School Reconstruction Project is also known as the Tonga High School Sports Complex Project and the Tonga High School Sports Complex for 2019 Pacific Games Project.AidData has status-coded the TOP 55 million ($24.8 million USD) grant commitment from April 15, 2017 as a suspended transaction (via Project ID#49242) since it was likely contingent upon Tonga's hosting of the 2019 Pacific Games, which Tonga ultimately chose not to do. The Chinese Government’s revised grant commitment from December 8, 2017 is captured in Project ID#62890.In the Overseas Development Finance Dataset that Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center published in December 2020, it identifies a $57 million China Eximbank loan in 2017 for the Tonga High School Sports Complex for 2019 Pacific Games Project (i.e. Phase 2 of the Tonga High School Reconstruction Project). This appears to be an error. None of the official sources that AidData has reviewed (including public reporting of outstanding public debts by Tonga’s Ministry of Finance) provide any evidence that the Government of Tonga contracted a China Eximbank loan for this project.

Chinese Government funds geological survey to support Phase 2 of Tonga High School Reconstruction Project (Linked to Project ID#39243, #68391)

# Description
On October 1, 2000, Tonga’s leading secondary school — Tonga High School — was destroyed in a fire. The school’s 1,060 students and teachers continued classes in the ruins of the school, and in tents before moving in October 2001 to a temporary school built at Old Vaiola, thanks to a $1.2 million grant from the New Zealand, Australian and French governments.   In 2002, the Chinese Government provided an RMB 33 million grant to the Government of Tonga for Phase 1 of the Tonga High School Reconstruction Project (captured via Project ID#39243). The purpose of the project was to reconstruct the Tonga High School complex in the city of Nukuʻalofa. The project involved the construction of six buildings (including one three-story block and five two story blocks), a schoolyard, roads, a fire reservoir (including an underground conservation pool), and water and power supply utilities. Three of the buildings were designed to house 54 classrooms. The project also involved the construction of a separate administration office and reading room, as well as two other blocks for special classrooms for science laboratory and industrial arts. The total floor space of the new school was 7,300 square meters.

Neither of the China Eximbank loans that supported this project are included in the Overseas Development Finance Dataset that Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center published in December 2020.3. In 2001, a joint venture called Janfull International Dateline Hotel Ltd. was established to manage the International Dateline Hotel in Tonga. It was jointly owned by Janfull Group (51% ownership stake) and International Dateline Hotel Ltd. (49% ownership stake). Janfull Group was owned by China’s Ministry of Commerce and International Dateline Hotel Ltd. was owned by the Government of Tonga. This joint venture is captured in Project ID#42192. In August 2010, the Government of Tonga announced its intent to dissolve the joint venture, citing differences with Janfull Group (a Chinese state-owned enterprise). At the time, the hotel was performing ‘well below international standards’, according to an ADB report. In June 2011, Tonga’s Minister of Public Enterprises successfully applied to have the joint venture placed into liquidation by a court. This move was designed to allow the Government of Tonga to regain control of the hotel—once it had proven its loan to the liquidator’s satisfaction—and then seek private investment or ownership to reestablish the hotel as a high-quality accommodation facility. The Government of Tonga purchased Janfull Group’s 51% ownership stake in Janfull International Dateline Hotel Ltd. after settling unpaid debts (worth $11 million) to China Eximbank. The Government of Tonga then asked the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to serve as a transaction advisor and structure, and competitively tender and award a project for the rehabilitation and operation of the International Dateline Hotel on a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) basis. After longer-than-anticipated negotiations, a long-term management concession agreement was signed with an international hotel operator – Tanoa Group – who completely redeveloped the hotel. As of late 2016, the hotel reopened. There have been no further costs to the Government of Tonga since the concession agreement was signed; the hotel is now the largest in Tonga, and a high-quality (4.5 star) hotel. Occupancy rates were estimated at 39% in April 2017.4. The concessional loan for Phase 1 was likely denominated in RMB. However, AidData has only managed to identify the USD equivalent of the face value of the loan. This issue requires further investigation.5. China Foreign Construction Corporation, Guangsha Chongqing Construction (Group) Co., Ltd., China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), Jiangsu Construction Group Corp., Hunan Construction Engineering Group Corporation, China National Overseas Engineering Corporation, Qingdao Construction Group Corporation were all invited to tender, but CCECC won the contract for Phase 2.","# Sector

The purpose of the project was to construct two separate Performing Arts Academies: The National Academy for the Performing Arts (NAPA) in Port of Spain (also known as the ‘north campus’), and the Southern Academy for the Performing Arts (SAPA) in San Fernando (also known as the ‘south campus’). Shanghai Construction Group (SCG) was the general EPC contractor (or ‘prime contractor’) responsible for project implementation. However, almost 30 sub-contractors from Trinidad and Tobago contributed nearly TT$100 million worth of goods and services during the completion of the project. The project was supervised by the Urban Development Corporation of Trinidad and Tobago (UDeCOTT) -- a state owned company of Trinidad and Tobago. Construction began in April 2007. NAPA was officially handed over to the Trinidadian Government on November 9, 2009, while SAPA was handed over on September 28, 2012.  However, this project became a major source of local controversy. On August 28, 2014, NAPA was deemed unsafe by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). It was subsequently closed for over two years, requiring $20 million dollars in renovations before reopening in January 2017. The issues cited were: badly secured lighting fixtures, shattered glass panes, issues with air quality, unsafe catwalks, unsafe stage areas, unsafe roofs, unsafe ceilings, loose bolts, and poor welding. Shanghai Construction Group did not cover the full cost of the renovations, citing that their maintenance contract only extended for a year after the building's construction. Michael Zhang, director of SCG Caribbean, stated that it was a misunderstanding and that sub-standard materials had been used, and that the company had done the best job it could. During the closure, Prime Minister Patrick Manning defended the structure as a ‘masterpiece.’  UDeCOTT chairman Calder Hart who supervised the initial construction of the project was accused of awarding TT$668 million worth of contracts to a Malaysian company that was linked to his wife Sherrine Hart.   The building is an ongoing expense for the Trinidadian government, which in 2014 paid TT$2,000,000 to support the structure and its performances. The maintenance cost was estimated at ten per cent of building cost per year, or TT$50 Million. It was part of Trinidad and Tobago's ‘Vision 2020’  initiative, which aimed to expand the cultural footprint of Trinidad and Tobago and substantially develop its urban areas.   NAPA contains a 53 room hotel and restaurant wing, which the Trinidadian parliament reported was not within the original design specifications. UDeCOTT has denied all allegations that the wing was constructed without approval. The wing was reported to be underutilized until 2018, when Cara hotels finally agreed to rent the structure, with no payment of its TT$390,000 lease expected until 2021.  NAPA was reportedly styled after the Chaconia, Trinidad and Tobago's national flower, and SAPA a ‘G-Clef’. NAPA has come under significant flak from the arts community, which cited a multitude of defective facilities. These included: no backstage loading door making many performances, including those of Trinidad's iconic Steel Drum, exceedingly difficult; accusations that the government outright lied about two smaller theaters on the premises, and that these are nothing but bare rooms; analogue lighting and sound equipment; concrete dance floors; no dressing rooms accessible from backstage; and no administrative offices (which required that the National Museum offices be temporarily evicted to make way for these), among numerous other complaints. The building was reportedly constructed with input from neither the arts community nor the university to which it was donated.  The same loans used to finance this project were also supposed to be used to construct a National Carnival Entertainment Centre directly behind NAPA. That project, however, remained unrealized as of June 2020.","1.
