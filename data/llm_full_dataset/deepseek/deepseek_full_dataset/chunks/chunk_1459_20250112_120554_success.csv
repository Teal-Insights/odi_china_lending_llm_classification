Then, on September 3, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Ghana signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 2.1 billion ($330 million). The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 17.2 year-maturity (final maturity date: November 21, 2025), a 5-year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2013), an interest rate of CIRR plus a margin of 0.75% (6.13%), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity (final maturity date: September 3, 2028), a 7 year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2015), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL is captured via Project ID#30801 and the BCL is captured via Project ID#183. The BCL was collateralized with (a) net revenue from a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between Bui Power Authority — an organization with a mandate to plan, execute and manage the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant Project — and the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) for the purchase of the energy to be generated from the Bui hydroelectric power plant, and (b) receivables from Ghana Cocoa Board’s sale of up to 30,000 tons of main crop cocoa and 10,000 tons of light crop cocoa per annum to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing under a 20-year, Cocoa Sales Agreement (CSA); and (c) and a mortgage of the land and building and equipment and machinery of the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant. The cocoa beans were sold at the prevailing market price rather than a fixed price, and the proceeds were to be placed in a Government of Ghana bank account to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). Then, once the dam was operational (and the cocoa agreement came to an end), 85% of the proceeds from sales of energy generated by the Bui hydroelectric power plant were to be placed in an escrow account held by China Eximbank to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). The borrower was expected to maintain a minimum cash balance in the escrow account. The escrow account balance was $27,275,000 in 2018 and $25,582,000 in 2019. The Government of Ghana bank account (for the cash proceeds from COCOBOD’s sale of cocoa to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing) had a balance of $167,816,000 in 2018 and $209,783,000 in 2019. The GCL, by contrast, was not collateralized; it was backed by the full faith and credit of the Government of Ghana. The borrower also purchased a buyer’s credit insurance policy from Sinosure at a cost of $25 million for the BCL (i.e. 8.5% of the face value of the BCL).  According to the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $293,506,062 loan (BCL) and the $330,000,000 loan (GCL) jointly achieved a 81.2% average disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 30 loan disbursements (worth $505,088,349.00) between 2009 and 2012: a $57,786,692.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #1) on May 15, 2009, a $35,217,544.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #2) on February 27, 2009, a $10,896,807.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #3) on October 26, 2009, a $27,469,679.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #4) on December 15, 2009, a $6,865,488.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #5) on January 18, 2010, a $9,390,036.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #6) on February 25, 2010, a $13,754,282.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #7) on May 9, 2010, a $18,208,899.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #8) on July 23, 2010, a $6,755,424.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #9) on July 23, 2010, a $8,919,668.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #10) on August 18, 2010, a $7,321,959.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #11) on September 20, 2010, a $6,563,979.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #12) on December 10, 2010, a $5,515,930.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #13) on December 6, 2010, a $107,904,311.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #14) on December 30, 2010, a $12,367,797.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #15) on February 28, 2011, a $8,689,838.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #16) on March 18, 2011, a $7,321,338.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #17) on April 28, 2011, a $6,870,418.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #18) on June 7, 2011, a $6,957,804.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #19) on July 22, 2011, a $16,330,457.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #20) on September 13, 2011, a $4,248,349.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #21) on October 31, 2011, a $4,071,390.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #22) on November 30, 2011, a $19,056,526.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #23) on December 28, 2011, a $5,071,871.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #24) on April 12, 2012, a $6,955,729.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #25) on April 12, 2012, a $14,889,380.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #26) on May 18, 2012, a $4,807,999.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #27) on June 22, 2012, a $48,355,586.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #28) on July 31, 2012, a $13,242,808.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #29) on October 12, 2012, and a $3,280,361.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #30) on November 30, 2012.

Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by Bui Power Authority. The dam was designed by the French engineering firm Coyne et Bellier, which also served as the consulting engineers on the project. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on August 24, 2007. However, construction did not begin until December 2, 2008. Then, on May 3, 2013, the first generator was inaugurated. The dam was inaugurated on December 19, 2013. However, the project was not completed and handed over to the Ghanaian authorities until November 28, 2016.   There are many indications that the China Eximbank loans for the Bui Dam Construction Project have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. First, in August 2017, the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod) — a state-owned company whose export receipts provide an important source of revenue for loan repayment to China Eximbank — told the country’s parliament it was in financial distress due to its loan repayment obligations related to the construction of the Bui Dam. Second, at least two of the four loans were rescheduled. Third, in April 2023, Samuel Kofi Dzamesi, the Chief Executive Officer of BPA revealed that the ECG had accumulated $612 million of payment arrears (overdue payments) to BPA. ECG’s payments to BPA for electricity purchases were originally intended to be the main source of revenue for repaying China Eximbank. Fourth, according to the World Bank’s International Development Statistics, the Government of Ghana had accumulated principal and interest arrears to one or more official sector Chinese creditors worth $908,337,346.70) in 2020 ($763,228,526.60 in principal arrears and $145,108,820.10 in interest arrears). Fifth, on December 19, 2022, the Government of Ghana announced a sovereign default, suspending debt service on its Eurobonds, its commercial loans, and most of its bilateral loans.","1.

The Gh-DCMIS also identifies the loan commitment date as January 29, 2013 rather than April 30, 2012. These issues warrant further investigation. 4. Loan repayment for the BCL involved a cocoa sales agreement between Genertec Corporation of China and the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod) for up to 30,000 metric tons of cocoa beans per year until the dam became operational. The cocoa beans were sold at the prevailing market price rather than a fixed price, and the proceeds were placed in an escrow account with China Eximbank to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). Then, once the dam was operational, the cocoa agreement ended and 85% of the proceeds from sales of energy generated by the Bui hydroelectric power plant were placed in an escrow account held by China Eximbank to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). Any excess funds in the escrow account could be withdrawn by Government Ghana, or they could stay in the account and earn interest. The price for the future electricity was tentatively negotiated to fall within a range of $0.035 and $0.055 cents per kilowatt-hour (kW/h). According to the World Bank, the average electricity tariff in Africa is much higher — at $0.13 per kW/h. 5.

# Title
China Eximbank provides RMB 2.1 billion government concessional loan for Bui Dam Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#183, #30709, #30086, #95483, #95484)

# Description
On September 25, 2007, China Eximbank and the Government of Ghana signed a buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement worth $293,506,062 for the Bui Dam Construction Project. Then, on September 3, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Ghana signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 2.1 billion ($330 million). The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 17.2 year-maturity (final maturity date: November 21, 2025), a 5-year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2013), an interest rate of CIRR plus a margin of 0.75% (6.13%), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity (final maturity date: September 3, 2028), a 7 year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2015), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL is captured via Project ID#30801 and the BCL is captured via Project ID#183. The BCL was collateralized with (a) net revenue from a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between Bui Power Authority — an organization with a mandate to plan, execute and manage the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant Project — and the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) for the purchase of the energy to be generated from the Bui hydroelectric power plant, and (b) receivables from Ghana Cocoa Board’s sale of up to 30,000 tons of main crop cocoa and 10,000 tons of light crop cocoa per annum to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing under a 20-year, Cocoa Sales Agreement (CSA); and (c) and a mortgage of the land and building and equipment and machinery of the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant. The cocoa beans were sold at the prevailing market price rather than a fixed price, and the proceeds were to be placed in a Government of Ghana bank account to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). Then, once the dam was operational (and the cocoa agreement came to an end), 85% of the proceeds from sales of energy generated by the Bui hydroelectric power plant were to be placed in an escrow account held by China Eximbank to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). The borrower was expected to maintain a minimum cash balance in the escrow account. The escrow account balance was $27,275,000 in 2018 and $25,582,000 in 2019. The Government of Ghana bank account (for the cash proceeds from COCOBOD’s sale of cocoa to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing) had a balance of $167,816,000 in 2018 and $209,783,000 in 2019. The GCL, by contrast, was not collateralized; it was backed by the full faith and credit of the Government of Ghana. The borrower also purchased a buyer’s credit insurance policy from Sinosure at a cost of $25 million for the BCL (i.e. 8.5% of the face value of the BCL).  According to the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $293,506,062 loan (BCL) and the $330,000,000 loan (GCL) jointly achieved a 81.2% average disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 30 loan disbursements (worth $505,088,349.00) between 2009 and 2012: a $57,786,692.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #1) on May 15, 2009, a $35,217,544.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #2) on February 27, 2009, a $10,896,807.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #3) on October 26, 2009, a $27,469,679.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #4) on December 15, 2009, a $6,865,488.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #5) on January 18, 2010, a $9,390,036.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #6) on February 25, 2010, a $13,754,282.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #7) on May 9, 2010, a $18,208,899.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #8) on July 23, 2010, a $6,755,424.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #9) on July 23, 2010, a $8,919,668.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #10) on August 18, 2010, a $7,321,959.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #11) on September 20, 2010, a $6,563,979.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #12) on December 10, 2010, a $5,515,930.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #13) on December 6, 2010, a $107,904,311.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #14) on December 30, 2010, a $12,367,797.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #15) on February 28, 2011, a $8,689,838.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #16) on March 18, 2011, a $7,321,338.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #17) on April 28, 2011, a $6,870,418.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #18) on June 7, 2011, a $6,957,804.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #19) on July 22, 2011, a $16,330,457.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #20) on September 13, 2011, a $4,248,349.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #21) on October 31, 2011, a $4,071,390.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #22) on November 30, 2011, a $19,056,526.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #23) on December 28, 2011, a $5,071,871.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #24) on April 12, 2012, a $6,955,729.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #25) on April 12, 2012, a $14,889,380.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #26) on May 18, 2012, a $4,807,999.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #27) on June 22, 2012, a $48,355,586.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #28) on July 31, 2012, a $13,242,808.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #29) on October 12, 2012, and a $3,280,361.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #30) on November 30, 2012.  Two additional loans from China Eximbank were negotiated on April 30, 2012 to pay for cost overruns on the dam (the so-called ‘Supplementary Bui Hydroelectric Dam Project’): a $75.4 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) with a maturity of 20 years (final maturity date: April 30, 2032), a 5 year grace period (first repayment date: April 30, 2017), and a 2% interest rate and a $76,206,939 buyer’s credit loan (BCL) with a maturity of 13.5 years (final maturity date: November 21, 2025), a 2 year grace period (first repayment date: April 30, 2014), and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.731% in April 2012) plus a 4% margin. The $75.4 million PBC is captured via Project ID#30086 and the $76,206,939 BCL is captured via Project ID#30709. According to the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $75.4 million PBC and the $76,206,939 BCL jointly achieved a 54.7% average disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 8 loan disbursements (worth $82,949,965.55) between 2014 and 2017: a $18,800,258.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #39) on April 9, 2014, a $8,065,407.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #35) on December 19, 2014, a $1,538,389.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #36) on December 31, 2014, a $3,649,254.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #37) on December 31, 2014, a $6,937,499.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #38) on April 9, 2015, a $14,815,581.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #40) on July 16, 2015, a $12,775,468.25 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #41) on March 11, 2016, and a $16,368,109.30 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #42) on January 25, 2017.  The 2008 GCL's (principal) amount outstanding was $297,615,000 in 2018, $301,237,000 in 2019, GHS 926,830,000 ($165,505,357) in 2020, and GHS 889,400,000 ($171,038,461) in 2021. The 2012 PBC's amount outstanding was $78,582,000 in 2018, $78,583,000 in 2019, GHS 415,680,000 ($74,228,571) in 2020, and GHS 399,990,000 ($76,921,153) in 2021. The 2007 BCL’s amount outstanding was $166,166,000 in 2018, $143,051,000 in 2019, GHS 621,650,000 ($111,008,928) in 2020, and GHS 618,100,000 ($118,865,384) in 2021. The 2012 BCL’s amount outstanding was $41,348,000 in 2018, $37,137,000 in 2019, GHS 269,920,000 ($48,200,000) in 2020, and GHS 274,000,000 ($52,692,307) in 2021.  The 2008 GCL's amount outstanding was $297,615,000 in 2018 and $301,237,000 in 2019. The 2012 PBC's amount outstanding was $78,582,000 in 2018 and $78,583,000 in 2019. The 2007 BCL’s amount outstanding was $166,166,000 in 2018 and $143,051,000 in 2019. The 2012 BCL’s amount outstanding was $41,348,000 in 2018 and $37,137,000 in 2019.  The GCL and PBC were eventually rescheduled such that repayments would commence on July 15, 2023 and end on July 15, 2037, which implies a maturity extension of 8.8 years and a grace period extension of 7.8 years for the GCL and a maturity extension of 5.2 years and a grace period extension of 6.2 years for the PBC. The 2% interest rate that originally applied to both the GCL and PBC also increased to 2.7% as part of the rescheduling. The GCL rescheduling is captured via Project ID#95483. The PBC rescheduling is captured via Project ID#95484.  The Bui Dam Construction Project had six components: (1) a roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) gravity dam incorporating a 5-bay spillway; (2) three penstocks in the middle of the dam; (3) a powerhouse at the toe of the dam on the left bank; (4) two rock fill saddle dams on the right bank; (5) a switchyard; and (6) 276 km of transmission lines; and a permanent bridge downstream of the dam.   Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by Bui Power Authority. The dam was designed by the French engineering firm Coyne et Bellier, which also served as the consulting engineers on the project. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on August 24, 2007. However, construction did not begin until December 2, 2008. Then, on May 3, 2013, the first generator was inaugurated. The dam was inaugurated on December 19, 2013.

91815,ENERGY,CDB lends $580 million to Phases 1 and 2 of 560 MW Sunon Asogli Power Plant Project (Linked to Project ID#30146 and ID#1866),"On June 13, 2007,  Shenzhen Energy Group Company Ltd and the China African Development Fund (CADF) created a special purpose vehicle and joint venture called Sunon Asogli Power (Ghana) Limited [深能安所固电力(加纳)有限公司]. China Development Bank (CDB) subsequently issued a series of loans (including medium-term, long-term, and working capital loans) between 2008 and 2017 worth $580 million to Sunon Asogli Power (Ghana) Limited in order to support the first phase and second phase of the 560MW Sunon Asogli Power Plant Project. The borrowing terms of these loans are unknown. However, it is known that some of these CDB loans were backed by partial repayment guarantees from Shenzhen Energy Group Company Ltd and collateralized against Shenzhen Energy Group Company Ltd’s 60% equity stake in Sunon Asogli Power (Ghana) Limited.   The purpose of the Sunon Asogli Power Plant Project was to construct a natural gas-fired thermal power plant — with a total installed capacity of 580 MW — in the Kpone neighborhood of the port city of Tema (exact locational coordinates: 5.680278, 0.047222). The first phase of the project involved the installation of 200 MW of power generation capacity and the second phase of the project involved the installation of 360 MW of power generation capacity. The total cost of the project was approximately $800 million. It was implemented as an independent power project (IPP) and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of approximately 80:20. China Gezhouba Group Corporation (CGGC) was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. A phase 1 groundbreaking (sod-cutting) ceremony took place on April 18, 2008. Phase 1 was completed in June 2009, but the 200 MW power plant did not begin commercial operations until October 2010 (due to delays in natural gas supply from the West African Gas Pipeline Authority to Ghana).    On September 2, 2014, CGGC officially started test piling for the project’s second phase. The pile foundation component of the project’s second phase consisted of 900 to 1,000 bored concrete piles with a diameter of 800mm. The 1st sub-phase (180 MW) of the project’s second phase was officially commissioned and inaugurated in April 2016 and the 2nd sub-phase (180 MW) was officially commissioned and inaugurated in July 2016. The second phase of the Sunon Asogli Power Plant (also known as the Kpone Thermal Power Station II) was put into commercial operation in January 2017.","1.

The Chinese project title is 加纳安所固燃气电厂项目 or 加纳燃气循环发电项目. 3. For most, and perhaps all, of the CDB loans, Shenzhen Energy Group Company Ltd issued corporate guarantees worth 60% of the face values of the loans (i.e. corporate guarantees that were proportional to Shenzhen Energy Group Company Ltd’s 60% ownership stake in Sunon Asogli Power (Ghana) Limited. 4. Various sources refer to a $100 million CDB loan in 2008 with a 10-year maturity (backed by a partial repayment guarantee from Shenzhen Energy Group Company Ltd), a $284,083,200 CDB loan in 2015 [backed by a partial repayment guarantee from Shenzhen Energy Group Company Ltd and collateralized against Shenzhen Energy Group Company Ltd’s 60% equity stake in Sunon Asogli Power (Ghana) Limited, and a $50 million CDB working capital loan in 2017 [backed by a partial repayment guarantee from Shenzhen Energy Group Company Ltd and collateralized against Shenzhen Energy Group Company Ltd’s 60% equity stake in Sunon Asogli Power (Ghana) Limited].

Phase 2 of the 560MW Sunon Asogli Power Plant Project is also known as the Kpone Thermal Power Station II Project. 6. China-Africa Development Fund made a $79.89 million equity contribution to the project. 7. Build-up of excess capacity charges guaranteed by the Government of Ghana lead to enormous fiscal challenges and threaten the viability of the country’s power sector as a whole. The Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC), which oversees tariff-setting methodology, excludes capacity charges and financing costs from its tariff calculations, adding to the shortfall. In 2018, excess generation capacity contracted under take-or-pay power purchase agreements (PPAs) cost the Government of Ghana $320 million in capacity charges, estimated to increase to $620 million annually with the addition of new plants in 2019. These unused supply charges are one of the most significant sources of financial strain on the country’s power sector. Cumulative net sector debt was $2,748 billion in 2018, with 30% payable to the private sector. This sum is equivalent to 33% of the Government of Ghana’s 2018 tax revenue, highlighting the scale of the financial burden. The Government of Ghana was forced to issue two series of bonds totaling GHS 5.66 billion in 2017 and 2018 to pay 50% of legacy debt owed to several energy sector actors, including various banks, VRA, ECG, and the Northern Electricity Distribution Company (NEDCo). Then, in 2020, the Government of Ghana settled another utility legacy debt — involving Sunon Asogli Power (Ghana) Limited — worth $203 million.  According to Sunon Asogli Power (Ghana) Limited, the settlement of the debt helped improve the credit ratings of the various organizations within the energy sector seeking for credit facilities from both domestic and international banks. “It has further reduced the indebtedness of government, Electricity Company of Ghana Limited (ECG), Volta River Authority (VRA), Ghana National Gas Company Limited (GNGC) and Sunon Asogli Power (Ghana) Limited making their books much better. We will continue to collaborate with all the parties within the energy sector and the Government of Ghana in meeting the electric power needs,” Sunon Asogli Power (Ghana) Limited added in a statement","# Sector

CDB lends $580 million to Phases 1 and 2 of 560 MW Sunon Asogli Power Plant Project (Linked to Project ID#30146 and ID#1866)

# Description
On June 13, 2007,  Shenzhen Energy Group Company Ltd and the China African Development Fund (CADF) created a special purpose vehicle and joint venture called Sunon Asogli Power (Ghana) Limited [深能安所固电力(加纳)有限公司]. China Development Bank (CDB) subsequently issued a series of loans (including medium-term, long-term, and working capital loans) between 2008 and 2017 worth $580 million to Sunon Asogli Power (Ghana) Limited in order to support the first phase and second phase of the 560MW Sunon Asogli Power Plant Project. The borrowing terms of these loans are unknown. However, it is known that some of these CDB loans were backed by partial repayment guarantees from Shenzhen Energy Group Company Ltd and collateralized against Shenzhen Energy Group Company Ltd’s 60% equity stake in Sunon Asogli Power (Ghana) Limited.   The purpose of the Sunon Asogli Power Plant Project was to construct a natural gas-fired thermal power plant — with a total installed capacity of 580 MW — in the Kpone neighborhood of the port city of Tema (exact locational coordinates: 5.680278, 0.047222). The first phase of the project involved the installation of 200 MW of power generation capacity and the second phase of the project involved the installation of 360 MW of power generation capacity. The total cost of the project was approximately $800 million. It was implemented as an independent power project (IPP) and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of approximately 80:20. China Gezhouba Group Corporation (CGGC) was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. A phase 1 groundbreaking (sod-cutting) ceremony took place on April 18, 2008. Phase 1 was completed in June 2009, but the 200 MW power plant did not begin commercial operations until October 2010 (due to delays in natural gas supply from the West African Gas Pipeline Authority to Ghana).    On September 2, 2014, CGGC officially started test piling for the project’s second phase. The pile foundation component of the project’s second phase consisted of 900 to 1,000 bored concrete piles with a diameter of 800mm. The 1st sub-phase (180 MW) of the project’s second phase was officially commissioned and inaugurated in April 2016 and the 2nd sub-phase (180 MW) was officially commissioned and inaugurated in July 2016. The second phase of the Sunon Asogli Power Plant (also known as the Kpone Thermal Power Station II) was put into commercial operation in January 2017.",TRUE,NA,GREY,HIGH,Natural Gas Power,"Primary purpose is natural gas-fired power generation, which has a complex relationship with energy transition goals","560MW natural gas-fired thermal power plant, implemented as independent power project"
