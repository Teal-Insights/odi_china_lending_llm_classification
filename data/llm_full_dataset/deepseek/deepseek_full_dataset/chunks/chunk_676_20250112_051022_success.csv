Then, on August 18, 2017, the International Economic Cooperation Agency of the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China and the Government of Madagascar signed a grant agreement for the project. The Chinese Government reportedly committed RMB 190 million of grant funding.   The Egg Road Rehabilitation Project involves the rehabilitation of a 19.25 kilometer road and connects three rural communes (Mahitsy, Ampanotokana and Mahazaza) located northwest of the capital city of Antananarivo.

The Egg Road (or Egg Route) is the only daily transport route for the 30,000 inhabitants of the three adjacent municipalities, 80% of whom depend on poultry farming production from 40 large local producers. The idea for ​this project was reportedly born when egg producers complained to the Malagasy President that most of their eggs break en route to their destination due to the poor condition of the road. Jiangxi Zhongmei Engineering Construction Co., Ltd. is the contractor responsible fo implementation.
