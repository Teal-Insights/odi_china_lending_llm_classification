The purpose of EGI was to connect all government ministries and some government departments into an e-government network and to provide services like videoconferencing, data and voice communication. It involved the establishment of a Primary Data Centre for Government at Statistics House; the establishment of the Network Operations Centre in Statistics House that will monitor the entire infrastructure; and an effort to connect all government ministries and some government departments through the laying of fiber optic cable onto the e-Government Network. Huawei was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Phase 1 of the project involved the laying of 168 km of fiber optic cable to connect the towns of Mukono, Bombo, Entebbe and Jinja to Kampala.
