The IDB would administer an additional B loan of 17,959,000 USD, which would be provided by another commercial bank or financial institution (Loan 3453B/OC-UR-SP-BBAOMAB). The financing package administered by IDB for this project totaled 124,038,670 USD. The total project cost was 180 million USD, with the remaining financing expected to be provided as counterpart financing.  The IDB approval date for this loan financing was 6 May 2015, and it refers to this project as ""UR-L1103 : Colonia Arias Wind Project"".  The ""PROSPECTO INFORMATIVO,"" published only a few days before the loan contract was signed, provided a sample loan contract that identifies loan terms that the final contract ""will be substantially similar to."" This document notes the loan will have two tranches, one of which (representing 75% of the total amount loaned) will have a fixed interest rate, and the other with a variable interest rate. The fixed interest rate was expected to be calculated with a fixed LIBOR rate determined three (3) business days prior to the date signature of the Loan Agreement, plus the following margins: 2.50% per year from the date of signature of the Loan Agreement until its second anniversary; 2.75% per year from the second anniversary to the sixth; 3% per year from the sixth anniversary to the tenth; 3.25% per year from the tenth anniversary until the fourteenth; and 3.40% from the fourteenth anniversary to the last Payment date. The variable interest rate for the funds coming from the China Co-Financing Fund and the IDB's A loan would have an interest rate based on the applicable LIBOR rate, plus the same margins specified above.

According to ""Fideicomiso Financiero Arias (en fase preoperativa) - Estados financieros correspondientes al ejercicio finalizado el 31 de diciembre de 2015..."", the total loan amount additionally has a commitment fee of 0.75% per year on the undisbursed amount. All three loans will also have a 20 year maturity and 2 year grace period. For the purposes of this project, the average 6-Month LIBOR in December 2015 (the date of signing of the agreement) was 0.764%, so the interest rate with the initial 2.5% margin has been coded as 3.264%.  The Colonia Arias Wind Farm has a 70 MW capacity and is part of a larger effort by the Government of Uruguay and the Administración Nacional de Usinas y Trasmisiones Eléctricas (UTE, National Administration of Power Plants and Electrical Transmissions in English) to develop 412 MW of wind farms that are fully or partially owned by UTE and, overall, reduce dependence on fossil fuels and hydraulic energy. The project includes not only the wind farm itself, including 35 wind turbines, but also a 26 km transmission line in the department of Flores. It is expected to produce 303.1 gigawatt-hours per year of electricity.   The Arias Financial Trust, to which these loans were provided, was created by UTE on September 12, 2014, specifically for this project. In addition to receiving these loans via the trust, the project also received equity financing: 80% through an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in the Montevideo Stock Exchange and the remaining 20% from UTE itself. About 70% of the project is funded by the long-term loan and 30% is funded through equity. The total project cost was estimated to be about 179.7 million USD.

Gamesa Eólica SL y Gamesa Uruguay SRL were the contractors engineering and constructing the project, per the IDB environmental impact report.
