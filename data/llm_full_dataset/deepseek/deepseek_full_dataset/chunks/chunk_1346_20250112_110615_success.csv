39343,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",China Eximbank provides RMB 678.5 million government concessional loan for Phase 1 of Pacific Marine Industrial Zone (PMIZ) Project (Linked to Project ID#64174),"On July 18, 2008, the Department of Commerce and Industry of the Government of Papua New Guinea and Shenyang International Economic and Technical Cooperation Company (CSYIC) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) regarding the Pacific Marine Industrial Zone (PMIZ) Project. Then, in November 2009, China Eximbank and the Government of Papua New Guinea signed a $95 million preferential loan framework agreement for Phase 1 of the Pacific Marine Industrial Zone (PMIZ) Project. On September 29, 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Papua New Guinea (represented by its Ministry of Treasury and Finance) signed an RMB 678,571,429 ($95 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for Phase 1 of the Pacific Marine Industrial Zone (PMIZ) Project. The GCL reportedly carried the following terms: 20-year maturity. 5-year grace period, 2% interest rate. The proceeds of the GCL were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract with CSYIC.   The purpose of the project was to construct a Pacific Marine Industrial Zone (PMIZ) in Portions 1349 and 1350 of Vidar Plantation within Madang Province. The project involved the construction of a fish port (with a cannery/tuna processing plant) and refrigeration plant), a fuel farm, a container terminal, a power plant, water and wastewater facilities, and an export processing zone. Upon completion, the project was expected to encourage onshore processing of tuna resources and create economies of scale, which would reduce post harvest losses through the construction of an integrated modern port complex.   The Department of Commerce and Industry of the Government of Papua New Guinea claimed at the time that the country was losing $808 million a year because it did not process fish caught in its waters. At the design/appraisal stage, an economic evaluation of the project suggested that it would achieve an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) about the Government of Papua New Guinea’s 12% hurdle rate.   CSYIC was the contractor responsible for implementation. Project implementation was delayed for years due to legal, land ownership, and environmental issues and China Eximbank reportedly withheld disbursements until some of these issues were resolved. The project officially entered implementation on November 24, 2015. However, in 2017, the project scope was expanded to include a larger wharf and cover the costs of water, electricity, and telecommunication connections. PNG's Prime Minister Peter O'Neill announced in September 2017 that China Eximbank would fund the expanded project with a $150 million dollar loan. The project ultimately completed and handed over to the local authorities on January 31, 2019.   The project was plagued by controversy for three reasons. First, an audit of the Department of Commerce and Industry revealed that government officials had siphoned off ‘millions of kina’ from the PMIZ project through graft and corruption. Second, government officials ignored independent recommendations to site the project in Port Moresby or Lae, where firms could utilize existing infrastructure to operate at lower production costs. The International Finance Corporation declined to finance for the PMIZ when the Department of Commerce and Industry refused a project feasibility assessment and indicated that it would only consider locating the PMIZ in Madang Province (which infrastructure, transport, labour and communications networks). Third, Madang residents mobilized land claims to demand a greater share of benefits from tuna-based investments. Hundreds of coastal residents staged large protests and defaced PMIZ billboards – consistent with predictions of a ‘high potential of sabotage from those that will be detrimentally affected by the PMIZ’ included in the PMIZ feasibility study contracted by China Eximbank.   In May 2015, individuals living within the impact area of the PMIZ, apparently under the guidance of Ken Fairweather (a Member of Parliament for Sumkar), circulated a petition “Stop PMIZ – a ‘Fishy Deal’"". They demanded a response by May 25, 2015. The petition was presented to the Governor of Madang. Ken Fairweather assisted the villagers by presenting it on the floor of Parliament. This brought a reaction from Nixon Duban, the member for Madang proper, who objected in Parliament, ‘Our people have registered their umbrella companies, they are all organized, and I want to assure the Government that we want this project to go ahead.’   Within a week Duban had the support of Madang Governor, Jim Kas. The Prime Minister, Peter O’Neill, had already put out a press release, which said that ‘The Government is fully supportive of the PMIZ project continuing. There has been some misinformation, particularly in relation to land ownership, and this is unfortunate. The land where the PMIZ project is located was bought from RD Tuna Cannery for four million Kina and is State land, not customary land as some have claimed. . . . We are satisfied that the project will not cause pollution to the environment, especially the pristine water ways and islands of Madang. . . . In total the project will generate K2 billion every year in economic activity to our nation with most of this being around Madang Province. Through this project, the processing of tuna will be done in Papua New Guinea instead of being sent overseas. The PMIZ will generate more than 20,000 jobs for local communities through direct employment and the generation of small business. . . . Very importantly, the Port township will be jointly owned by the local communities, the Madang Provincial Government and the National Government.’","1. This project is also known as the Papua New Guinea Pacific Aquatic Products Processing Zone Project. The Chinese project title is 巴新太平洋渔业工业园项目.2. Project ID#39343 captures the original RMB 678,571,429 ($95 million) loan. Project ID#64174 captures the $55 million increase in the face value of the loan in 2017. AidData assumes that the same borrowing terms that applied to the original loan also applied to the expanded loan. 3. The Pacific Marine Industrial Zone (PMIZ) Project was originally designed as a $230 million project that would be implemented in two phases (with the first phase costing $95 million). It is unclear if the 2017 project rescoping include elements of the original design of Phase 2.","# Sector

Canada-based Peru Copper Inc. originally owned 91% of shares and the remaining 9% were owned by unspecified firms. Shortly thereafter, all of the mining concessions in Toromocho were transferred to Chinalco's wholly-owned subsidiary, Minera Chinalco Peru S.A. (Chinalco Peru).  Then, on December 1, 2010, China Eximbank and Minera Chinalco Perú S.A. ('Chinalco Peru') — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of Aluminum Corporation of China Limited (Chinalco) — signed a $2 billion overseas investment loan to finance capital expenditures related to the Toromocho Copper Mine Project (captured via Project #36064). The loan carried an interest rate 6-month LIBOR plus 185 basis points. However, its other borrowing terms are unknown. The parent company Chinalco entered into a guarantee agreement with China Eximbank for the entire outstanding amount, accrued interest, penalties and other expenses arising from the loan from China Eximbank. Chinalco was also required to pay a 1% commission for each drawdown. This overseas investment loan facility is secured by (i.e. collateralized against) all property, plant and equipment pertaining to the Toromocho Project if Chinalco’s credibility or financial status deteriorates. In March 2013, China Eximbank and Chinalco Peru signed a supplementary overseas investment loan (facility) agreement worth $419 million for additional capital expenditures related to the Toromocho Copper Mine Project (captured via Project #56098). The loan carried an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 350 basis points. The other borrowing terms are unknown. Chinalco Peru was required to pay a 1% commission fee for each drawdown and this second facility was also guaranteed by the parent company of Chinalco. The supplementary loan agreement was also collateralized against all property, plant and equipment pertaining to the Toromocho Mining Project if Chinalco’s credibility or financial status deteriorates. As of 2016, the entirety of this loan facility was drawn down.   The Toromocho Project is located in central Peru in the core of the Morococha mining district. It is one of the largest copper mines in the world, and the first greenfield copper mine developed by a Chinese corporation abroad. Upon completion, the project was expected to boost overall copper exports from Peru by 25%.   CCCC Del Peru SAC (subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company, Ltd.) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. The Environmental Impact Assessment of the Toromocho Copper Mine Project was approved by the Peruvian government in December 2010. Chinalco Peru obtained the construction permit and began work in July 2011. The mines were officially commissioned on December 10, 2013. However, three months after its inauguration, the operation of the mine was suspended by Peru’s Environment Assessment and Enforcement Agency (OEFA) after it discovered illegal discharge of acid effluents in two nearby lakes.

# Title
China Eximbank provides $2 billion overseas investment loan for capital expenditures related to Toromocho Copper Mine Project (Linked to Project ID#56098)

# Description
Between June and August 2007, Aluminum Corporation of China (Chinalco) acquired 100% of the shares in the Toromocho Copper Mine Project for CAD 840 million ($789 million) . Canada-based Peru Copper Inc. originally owned 91% of shares and the remaining 9% were owned by unspecified firms. Shortly thereafter, all of the mining concessions in Toromocho were transferred to Chinalco's wholly-owned subsidiary, Minera Chinalco Peru S.A. (Chinalco Peru).  Then, on December 1, 2010, China Eximbank and Minera Chinalco Perú S.A. ('Chinalco Peru') — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of Aluminum Corporation of China Limited (Chinalco) — signed a $2 billion overseas investment loan to finance capital expenditures related to the Toromocho Copper Mine Project (captured via Project #36064). The loan carried an interest rate 6-month LIBOR plus 185 basis points. However, its other borrowing terms are unknown. The parent company Chinalco entered into a guarantee agreement with China Eximbank for the entire outstanding amount, accrued interest, penalties and other expenses arising from the loan from China Eximbank. Chinalco was also required to pay a 1% commission for each drawdown. This overseas investment loan facility is secured by (i.e. collateralized against) all property, plant and equipment pertaining to the Toromocho Project if Chinalco’s credibility or financial status deteriorates. In March 2013, China Eximbank and Chinalco Peru signed a supplementary overseas investment loan (facility) agreement worth $419 million for additional capital expenditures related to the Toromocho Copper Mine Project (captured via Project #56098). The loan carried an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 350 basis points. The other borrowing terms are unknown. Chinalco Peru was required to pay a 1% commission fee for each drawdown and this second facility was also guaranteed by the parent company of Chinalco. The supplementary loan agreement was also collateralized against all property, plant and equipment pertaining to the Toromocho Mining Project if Chinalco’s credibility or financial status deteriorates. As of 2016, the entirety of this loan facility was drawn down.   The Toromocho Project is located in central Peru in the core of the Morococha mining district. It is one of the largest copper mines in the world, and the first greenfield copper mine developed by a Chinese corporation abroad. Upon completion, the project was expected to boost overall copper exports from Peru by 25%.   CCCC Del Peru SAC (subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company, Ltd.) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. The Environmental Impact Assessment of the Toromocho Copper Mine Project was approved by the Peruvian government in December 2010. Chinalco Peru obtained the construction permit and began work in July 2011. The mines were officially commissioned on December 10, 2013. However, three months after its inauguration, the operation of the mine was suspended by Peru’s Environment Assessment and Enforcement Agency (OEFA) after it discovered illegal discharge of acid effluents in two nearby lakes. Chinalco quickly resolved this matter by building improved drainage and explained the incident as a result of unusual heavy rainfall which caused unexpected acid runoffs.
