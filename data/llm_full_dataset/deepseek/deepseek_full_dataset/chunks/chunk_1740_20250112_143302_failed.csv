543,COMMUNICATIONS,Chinese Government provides $4 million grant for Phase 1 of Egyptian Remote Education Project (Linked to Project ID#500 and ID#65829),"In 2002, China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) provided a $4 million grant to the Government of Egypt for Phase 1 of the Egyptian Remote Education Project (captured in Project ID#543). Then, on December 6, 2004, Egypt's Minister of State for International Cooperation, Fayza Abul Nagaa, and China's Minister of Commerce, Bo Xilai, signed an RMB 30,000,000 (approximately $4.5 million) grant agreement for Phase 2 of the Egyptian Remote Education Project (captured in Project ID#500).  Then, on October 27, 2018, the Chinese Government and the Government of Egypt signed an exchange of letters, committing RMB 79 million ($11.5 million) of grant funding for Phase 3 of the Egyptian Remote Education Project (captured in Project ID#65829).   Egyptian Presidential Order No. (2019) ratified the exchange of letters into Egyptian law on June 24, 2019. The grant proceeds for Phase 3 were drawn from an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) that the two governments signed on December 23, 2014.  The purpose of the Egyptian Remote Education Project was to establish a distance learning network for Egypt's Ministry of Education. The network was designed to support basic educational courses, lectures, and teacher training activities.   The project was implemented in three phases. Phase 1 involved the establishment of 33 distance learning terminals in 27 Egyptian governorates. It also sought to connect these terminals to a training center in ‘Mubarak Education City’ in the city of ‘6th of October’ (Arabic: السادس من أكتوبر‎) within Giza governorate. Each terminal was equipped with video, audio, and remote white board devices. Phase 2 involved an expansion of the network from 33 terminals to 143 terminals in 27 Egyptian governorates. The purpose of Phase 3 is to expand, upgrade, and  transform the measures and technologies already put in place during Phase 1 and 2. It involves an expansion of the network from 143 terminals to 200 terminals (through the installation of audio-visual technologies in 57 additional Egyptian schools). Its ultimate aim is to address a lack of teachers in some schools by connecting students and teachers through audio-visual technologies. Phase 1 project design work began in late 2001. MOFCOM then issued a Phase 1 implementation contract to ZTE Corporation in August 2002.    Phase 1 was officially completed and handed over to the local authorities on March 18, 2003.

Phase 2 commenced on January 31, 2007 and reached completion on June 30, 2007. Then, on January 19, 2016, the Egyptian Ministry of Education and ZTE Corporation signed a cooperation agreement related to Phase 3.  As of early 2021, Phase 3 had not yet entered implementation.",1. Egypt’s Ministry of International Cooperation identifies an RMB 79 million grant for the Implementation of Remote Education System Upgrade 'Phases 1 and 2' and Extension 'Phase 3' Project.
