Then, in late 2005, the Chinese Representation Office in Ramallah and the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs approached the United Nations Development Programme/Programme of Assistance to the Palestinian People (UNDP/PAPP) about the possibility of the supporting the implementation of this project.   On October 4, 2008, a tripartite project implementation agreement was signed by the funder (China’s Ministry of Commerce), the recipient (the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs), and the organization responsible for project implementation (UNDP/PAPP). This agreement allocated $4,160,000 of grant funding (captured in Project ID#64968) for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Building Construction Project: $3,550,716 would be used for construction and design costs; $449,284 would be used to decorate the office; and the remaining $160,000 would be set aside for a ‘Chinese Administration Fee’. The agreement also defined the scope of the project, which included constructing, furnishing and equipping a new office building for the Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) in the city of Ramallah (رام الله).  The 11 story building, which occupies a total area of 9,481.74 m2, was designed to accommodate approximately 400 staff.

A Chinese firm called China Friendship Development International Engineering Design and Consultation Co., Ltd. was also selected to assist with project supervision and evaluation duties.   At the time that the October 4, 2008 agreement was signed, project implementation was expected to last two years and end on October 3, 2010. However, this project encountered various delays, which slowed its implementation. On December 14, 2009, the Chinese Government and the Palestinian National Authority signed another exchange of letters, and China’s Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Palestinian National Authority, and UNDP signed a supplemental tripartite project implementation agreement on September 5, 2010. Through the latter agreement, China’s Ministry of Commerce allocated an additional $6,840,000 of grant funding for the project (captured in Project ID#65688). The agreement specified that the grant funding would be drawn from two Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreements (ETCA) that the Chinese Government and the Palestinian National Authority signed on December 27, 2004 and May 18, 2005.
