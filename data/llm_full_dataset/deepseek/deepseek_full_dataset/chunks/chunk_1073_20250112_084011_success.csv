The project involved the construction of the 275MW Soubré dam and hydroelectric power plant located near Naoua Falls on the Sassandra River in the Nawa Region. The dam was to have a maximum height of 20 meters, a length of 4.5 kilometers, and a storage capacity of 83 million cubic meters. The project also involved the construction a 225 kV electricity transmission line from Soubré to Taabo, the construction a 225 kv transmission line from Taabo to Yopougon 2 (to serve the greater Abidjan area), and the expansion of the Soubré, Taabo and Yopougon substations.  Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. was the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. It, in turn, hired Alstom to design, manufacture, supervise installation, commission, test, and provide other services for three 90 MW Francis turbine-generator sets, a 5 MW Bulb turbine generator, and other related equipment. Dam construction supervision services were provided by TRACTEBEL. The project was originally scheduled to last 56 months. Beginning in February 2013, the manufacturing of the turbines began in Tianjin, China. Construction began on September 24, 2013. The project achieved a 30% completion rate by October 2014, a 74% completion rate by March 2016, and a 100% completion rate by the end of March 2017. The transmission lines from Soubré to Taabo and Taabo to Yopougon 2 were officially inaugurated in June 2017. The project as a whole was officially completed and handed over to the Ivorian authorities on November 2, 2017.   However, the project did encounter several implementation obstacles related to the resettlement and compensation of populations affected by the dam, notwithstanding the fact that it was subjected to an ex ante environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA).   Société des Energies de Côte d’Ivoire (CI-ENERGIES) — a state-owned asset holding company that is responsible for managing assets in the electricity sector — now operates the Soubré hydroelectric power plant.","1.

The project involved the construction of the 275MW Soubré dam and hydroelectric power plant located near Naoua Falls on the Sassandra River in the Nawa Region. The dam was to have a maximum height of 20 meters, a length of 4.5 kilometers, and a storage capacity of 83 million cubic meters. The project also involved the construction a 225 kV electricity transmission line from Soubré to Taabo, the construction a 225 kv transmission line from Taabo to Yopougon 2 (to serve the greater Abidjan area), and the expansion of the Soubré, Taabo and Yopougon substations.  Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. was the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. It, in turn, hired Alstom to design, manufacture, supervise installation, commission, test, and provide other services for three 90 MW Francis turbine-generator sets, a 5 MW Bulb turbine generator, and other related equipment. Dam construction supervision services were provided by TRACTEBEL. The project was originally scheduled to last 56 months. Beginning in February 2013, the manufacturing of the turbines began in Tianjin, China. Construction began on September 24, 2013. The project achieved a 30% completion rate by October 2014, a 74% completion rate by March 2016, and a 100% completion rate by the end of March 2017. The transmission lines from Soubré to Taabo and Taabo to Yopougon 2 were officially inaugurated in June 2017. The project as a whole was officially completed and handed over to the Ivorian authorities on November 2, 2017.   However, the project did encounter several implementation obstacles related to the resettlement and compensation of populations affected by the dam, notwithstanding the fact that it was subjected to an ex ante environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA).
