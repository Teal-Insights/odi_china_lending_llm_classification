The monetary value of this grant commitment is unknown.   The project involved the provision of eight electricity generators with 10.6MW of power generation capacity: 4 generators (with 6MW of power generation capacity) for the Voidjou (Vwadju) power plant on the island of Ngazidja (Grande Comore); 1 generator (with (with 3MW of power generation capacity) for the Wemani power plant in city of Fomboni on the island of Mohéli (Mwali); and 2 generators (with 3MW of power generation capacity) for the Trenani power plant on the island of Ndzuani (Anjouan).   The generators were successfully handed over to the Comorian authorities on August 5, 2010. The Chinese Government asked the Government of Comoros to pay for the cost of installing these generators, but they were unable to do so, which led to major delays in generator installation and use. China’s Ministry of Commerce subsequently agreed to provide a grant worth 200 million Comorian francs for the installation of the generators (through the so-called 'Electricity Generator Installation Project').   A contract with China Shenyang International Economic & Technical Cooperation corporation (CSYIC) was signed on September 29, 2012 to facilitate the implementation of the China Shenyang International Economic & Technical Cooperation Corporation (CSYIC).

The borrower was required to keep a minimum deposit balance of 15-20% of total outstanding loans in an escrow account. All subsidiary loans approved through this framework agreement were to carry the following terms: a 5-year grace period, a 20-year maturity and a 0.25% interest rate.    According to the Congolese authorities, only one subsidiary loan was ultimately approved through this framework agreement: a $1 billion loan in 2012 for the Dolisie-Brazzavile Section of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project (captured in Project ID#369). The loan’s (principal) amount outstanding was $1,000,000,000 as of December 31, 2019.  This project, which is also known as Phase 2 of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project, involved the construction of a 376 km road segment along National Route 1 (NR1) between Dolisie and PK45 north of Brazzaville.    China Eximbank also issued multiple loans for Phase 1 of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project (captured in Project ID#68874, ID#72780, ID#72781, and ID#72782). China State Construction Engineering Corporation Ltd. (CSCEC) was the contractor responsible for the implementation of Phase 1 and Phase 2.    The groundbreaking ceremony for Phase 2 took place on December 22, 2011. Phase 2 was completed on October 3, 2015. The four-lane, 535 km Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) was officially inaugurated on March 1, 2016.    The $1 billion China Eximbank loan that supported Phase 2 was rescheduled on April 29, 2019. Under the terms of the debt rescheduling agreement, the Republic of Congo agreed to repay 33% of its its outstanding obligations for the Phase 2 (375 km Dolisie-Brazzaville Section) of National Route 1 (RN1) Construction Project within 3 years (more specifically, by December 31, 2021). For the remaining 67% of its outstanding obligations, the Republic of Congo agreed to a new repayment schedule that involved extending the maturity the loan by 15 years (from 20 years to 35 years) and resetting the interest rate of the loan from 0.25% to to 2%.  This debt rescheduling is captured in Project ID#58340.    Around the time of the rescheduling, the Republic of Congo was facing a balance of payment crisis and it decided to concession the RN1 through a toll-operate-transfer (TOT) privatization. The concession was won by La Congolaise des Routes S.A. (LCR), a joint venture between CSCEC (70% ownership stake), Egis Projects (15% ownership stake) and the Congolese Government (15% ownership stake). As of March 2019, LCR operated the RN1 through a 30-year franchise agreement. According to Li Jiqin, Chairman of CSCEC International, CSCEC reached out to the Republic of Congo for this deal because the NR1 was left unmaintained after its construction was completed in 2016.  Under this new agreement, CSCEC is responsible for maintaining the road while the French company, Egis, is responsible for managing toll collection. The CSCEC’s upfront equity investment in this public-private partnership (PPP) helped the Republic of Congo address its balance of payments crisis. The Republic of Congo also tried to convince the CSCEC to invest in a similar TOT privatization of National Route 2 (which was also constructed with financial support from China Eximbank), but the company declined as it believed the deal would not generate enough profit.","1.

Then, in 2017, China Eximbank and the Republic of Congo signed a $62,646,626.90 loan agreement (captured in Project ID#57529) for Phase 2 of the National Telecommunication Coverage Project. This loan has a maturity length of 17 years, but its interest rate and grace period are unknown. The proceeds from this loan was to be used for the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $73 million commercial contract for Phase 2.   Phases 1 and 2 involved the construction of a fiber optic cable (“backbone”) network (measuring more than 3000 km in length) that connects the cities of Pointe-Noire, Makoua, Dolisie, Brazzaville, Oyo and Ouesso (through an underground fibre optic cable runs between Pointe-Noire and Ouesso and between Makoua and Ouesso and through an overhead cable that piggybacks on the National Electricity Company’s EHV electricity transmission lines linked to the Moukoukoulou and Imboulou hydroelectric dams); the construction of several additional fiber optic cable segments (“branches”) that connect to the backbone (a 130 km segment from Ngo to Djambala, a 70 km segment from Loudima to Sibiti, and an 80 km segment from Oyo to Boundji); and the construction of fiber optic cable loops around the cities of Brazzaville, Pointe-Noire, Oyo, and all of the country’s departmental capitals (measuring 700 km in length).   Alcatel-Lucent Shanghai Bell Co., Ltd., Huawei, and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) were the contractors responsible for the implementation of Phases 1 and 2. The project officially commenced in August 2010. In January 2013, the project achieved provisional acceptance of one segment of the fiber optic cable (“backbone”) network between Pointe-Noire and Brazzaville (measuring more than 510 km in length). As of February 2014, it had nearly completed another segment of the backbone: from Brazzaville to Owando (510 km in length) and then onward to city of Ouesso. Phases 1 and 2 were eventually completed, but their precise completion dates are unknown.",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,General Infrastructure,Project focuses on telecommunications infrastructure without clear environmental or energy transition impacts,"Construction of fiber optic cable network, telecommunications coverage expansion"
