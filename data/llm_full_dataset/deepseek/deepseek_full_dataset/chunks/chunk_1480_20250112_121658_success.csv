64520,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",China Eximbank provides $560 million loan for Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Project (Linked to Project ID#64653),"In 2004, China Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd. signed a development framework agreement with the Papua New Guinea government and foreign partner companies, Highlands Pacific Company Co Ltd and PNG stakeholders Mineral Resources Development Company (MRDC), for the development of the Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Project. In 2005, China Metallurgical Group and its partners signed a 'Master Agreement' and an 'Association Agreement' to establish a framework for financing the Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Project.   Then, on July 23, 2008, MCC Ramu NiCo Ltd. — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of MCC-JJJ Mining Development Co. — finalized a $1.4 billion financing package necessary to complete the Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Mine Project. The project was financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30. 40% of the total project cost was financed through a China Eximbank loan worth $560 million (captured via Project ID#64520) and 30% of the total project cost was financed through a 10-year, $473 million syndicated shareholder loan from MCC-JJJ Mining Development Company Ltd. The loans were to be repaid by 2017 (8 years from the commissioning date of the mine). The interest rate of the USD-denominated loan was set to LIBOR (3.119%) plus a 1.6% margin and the interest rate of the RMB-denominated loan was approximately 4.7%. The remaining project costs were financed via shareholder equity contributions.   The Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Project is located in Madang Province on the north coast of Papua New Guinea. The project comprises the Kurumbukari (“KBK”) mine and a beneficiation plant (designed to treat around 4.6 million tons of ore per annum), located on the Kurumbukari plateau, in the foothills of the Bismarck Ranges, 600-800 meters above sea level and 75 kilometers (“km”) to the southwest of the provincial capital of Madang, and the Basamuk processing plant located on the coast, approximately 55 km southeast of Madang. The KBK mine is at latitude 5° 34´ S and longitude 145° 13´ E and the Basamuk refinery is at latitude 5° 32´ S and longitude 145° 8´E. Beneficiated ore is pumped from the mine as a slurry to the plant via a 135km pipeline. The Basamuk plant is designed to produce a mixed nickel-cobalt hydroxide product containing around 32,600 tonnes nickel and 3,300 tonnes cobalt on an annual basis.   China Metallurgical Group Co Ltd was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. On November 3, 2006, a foundation laying ceremony took place. However, the implementation of the project was delayed for two years due to legal appeals over environmental issues. Also, in January 2008, local landowners staged a protest against the project Managers from China Metallurgical Group Co Ltd and four local chiefs held crisis talks in Madang town over a range of grievances. The landowners demanded that China Metallurgical Group Co Ltd stop operations until the dispute was settled. The landowners presented 18 points, complaining about their lack of participation in spin-off business, the employment of heavily armed Chinese security guards, discrimination at the work site and language barriers.   One month earlier, a former PNG health minister, Sir Peter Barter, called for an independent environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the project after discrediting the existing EIA. PNG's Lutheran head bishop, Doctor Wesley Kigasung, also warned that pollution from the mine could cause up to 80,000 sea-dependent locals to lose their livelihoods. The project was ultimately completed and handed over on December 6, 2012.  In 2014, local rioting broke out against Chinese workers at the KBK mine.   Then, in February 2020, a coalition of more than 5,000 villagers and a provincial government in Papua New Guinea sued MCC Ramu NiCo Ltd., demanding not only that its Chinese owners pay restitution totaling 18 billion kina ($5.2 billion), but also that it stop dumping mine waste into the ocean and remediate the allegedly contaminated waters. Half a million people rely on the local fisheries in the Coral Triangle biodiversity hot spot, and the plaintiffs argue that their lives and food supply are at stake.

46985,HEALTH,Chinese Government funds design contract for Arzobispo Loayza National Hospital expansion through 2003 ETCA (Linked to Project ID#56926 and #73148),"On February 13, 2008, the Peruvian Ministry of Health and the Beijing Architectural Design Institute, on behalf of the Peruvian and Chinese governments respectively, signed a design contract for the expansion of the Arzobispo Loayza National Hospital (Diseño para el Proyecto de Ampliación del Hospital Nacional Arzobispo Loayza, captured in project #56926). The contract was worth 8% of the total project cost, ultimately estimated to be 2.88 million RMB, although it was initially valued at 3.6 million RMB.   The funds were drawn from the grant provided by the Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) signed between the two governments on January 17, 2003 (Project ID#73148). The hospital expansion project itself was agreed to in Letters of Exchange signed on March 30, 2007.  The design contract stipulates that the Beijing Institute of Architectural Design will create construction plans for the additional portion of the hospital to be built, sending a design team of four to Peru to do so. They also agreed to send a representative of the design team to Peru during the actual construction. The building's purpose was to house a new General Intensive Care Unit, a Intermediate Care Unit, a Blood Bank, a Sterilization center, and a Nutrition center.","Transaction amount is calculated using the formula outlined in the design contract itself, taking 8% of 36 million, the stated cost of the project in the construction contract. The construction contract can be found in the source 'Resolución Directoral 011-2011-DGIEM.' It not entirely clear from the two contracts' language if the design contract's cost is included in the 36 million RMB construction contract cost. However, the language 'The price above [36 million RMB] refers to the total price of the work carried out by the Chinese Party according to what is stipulated in this contract' is enough to imply the costs are separate, given that, although the design contract is listed as a 'foundational' document, the portion of the construction contract listing responsibilities of the Chinese government does not include design responsibilities (quote translated, Contrato de Construccion del Proyecto de 'Amplicación del Hospital Nacional Arzobispo Loayza' in 'Resolución Directoral 011-2011-DGIEM').","# Sector
