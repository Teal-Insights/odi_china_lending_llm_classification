The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 6-year grace period, and an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3% margin. The loan was also backed by a credit insurance policy from China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation (SINOSURE). China Eximbank provided the loan in three separate loan tranches. The first tranche is worth $1,289,029,000 (captured via Project ID#70086) and it supported the Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project. The second tranche is worth $981,260,000 (captured via Project ID#70085) and it supported the Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project.  The third tranche is worth $220,471,000 (captured via Project ID#70083) and it supported the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $1,289,029,000 China Eximbank loan tranche to finance 70% of the cost of a $1,841,470,000.00 commercial (EPC) contract between the Ethiopian Railway Corporation (ERC) and China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), which was signed on October 25, 2011 (and modified on November 5, 2012, February 7, 2013, and March 15, 2013) to support the construction of a 329 km Sebeta (Addis Ababa) to Miesso section of the railway. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $981,260,000 China Eximbank loan to finance 70% of the cost of a $1,401,800,000 commercial (EPC) contract between the ERC and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), which was signed on December 16, 2011 (and modified on November 2, 2012, February 7, 2013, and March 8, 2013) to support the construction of a 339 km section of the railway that runs from Miesso (Meiso) to Dewelle (Dewanle) on Ethiopia's border with Djibouti. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $220,471,000 China Eximbank loan to finance approximately 85% of a $259 million commercial contract between China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) and the ERC, which was signed in March 2013 to support the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project. The purpose of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 750.224 km railway from Sebeta to Nagad. The purpose of the Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 329.065 km railway section from Sebeta to Meiso (Mieso) that consists of two subsections: a 113.836 km railway subsection from Sebeta to Adama and a 215.229 km subsection from Adama to Meiso (Mieso). The purpose of the Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 339.182 km railway section from Meiso (Mieso) or to Dewelle (Dewanle/Dawanle) on Ethiopia's border with Djibouti. The line runs from Mieso to the east — via Mulu, Afdem, Bike,Gota, Erer, and Hurso — to Dire-Dawa. It then turns to the north before reaching Arawa, and then runs from Adigala to Lasarat, Aysha, Dawanle and the border between Ethiopia and Djibouti.  The purpose of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project was to acquire 5 electric locomotives, 6 diesel locomotives, 30 railway passenger cars and 1,100 railway freight cars for the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway.  * Loan Disbursements: According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $1,289,029,000 (ETB 24,004,264,432) loan tranche for the Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project achieved a 104% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 14 loan disbursements (worth ETB 24,905,259,256) between 2014 and 2020: an ETB 1,062,992,126 disbursement on July 8, 2014, an ETB 5,420,000,000 disbursement on October 8, 2014, an ETB 2,303,030,303 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 5,597,115,886 disbursement on April 8, 2015, an ETB 1,808,159 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 1,740,583,177 disbursement on January 7, 2016, an ETB 825,731,677 disbursement on April 7, 2016, an ETB 2,165,153,034 disbursement on July 7, 2016, an ETB 143,690,666 disbursement on October 7, 2016, an ETB 923,238,863 disbursement on January 7, 2017, an ETB 325,274,645 disbursement on April 7, 2017, an ETB 372,159,087 disbursement on July 7, 2017, an ETB  1,422,471,270 disbursement on September 20, 2017, and an ETB 2,602,010,364 disbursement on November 12, 2020.

The railway begins at Sebeta, just outside of Ethiopia's capital of Addis Ababa. The city is served by two stations in its southern outskirts, at Furi-Labu and Indode. The line then runs southeast to Modjo and Adama, both towns located in the Ethiopian Great Rift Valley. At Modjo, a railway junction exists for the planned Modjo–Hawassa Railway. In addition, at Modjo the railway is connected to the Modjo Dry Port, Ethiopia's most important inland dry port and also Ethiopia's main hub for domestic and international freight services. At Adama, the railway turns northeast towards Dire Dawa. At Awash, there is a junction with the Awash–Hara Gebeya Railway, which is under construction as of 2018. Directly after Awash station, the line crosses 60 meters above the Awash River canyon over a 155 meter long bridge, the main bridge of the railway.The railway then proceeds to Dire Dawa, where it turns and heads directly for Djibouti. Crossing the Ethiopia-Djibouti border between Dewale and Ali Sabieh, the line reaches the Djibouti passenger terminal at Nagad railway station, near Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport. In February 2001; the Government of Ethiopia asked CCECC to inspect the line and propose a construction plan. This plan was put on hold for several years due to a lack of funding. After years of continued deterioration due to mismanagement, a 2007 pre-feasibility study indicated that the line needed to be renovated (at a cost of approximately $3.4 billion. The proposed renovation of the railway was designed to include a double track from Addis Ababa to Adama, a single track from Adama to Dewele, a 1035 meter long bridge, the grand bridge at DK42, the 155 meter Awash grand bridge, and a Labu station upgrade. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the Yaji Railway would run passenger trains (at 120 km/hr) and cargo trains (at 80 km/hr).   * Project Implementation:  Construction began in 2012 and the project as a whole had achieved a 50% completion rate by 2014.  Track laying for the railway began in May 2015.  The railway was opened for passenger services on October 4, 2016. Then, on December 31, 2017, Ethiopian Railway Company issued a project handover certificate to CREC and CCECC. The next day, on January 1, 2018, a ceremony was held to mark the beginning of the railway’s commercial operations. Two days later, in January 3, 2018, a two-way passenger train on the Ethiopian section of the railway went into service.  The Yali Railway was the first overseas railway constructed by Chinese enterprises that adhered to international standards (1,435 mm gauge line and electrification at 25 kV) and used Chinese equipment (CSR Zhuzhou for the rolling stock). The Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was originally scheduled (under the terms of the EPC contract) to commence on February 12, 2012 and reach completion within 42 months (August 12, 2015). It was ultimately completed about 15 months behind schedule (November 12, 2016). The Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was originally scheduled (under the terms of the EPC contract) to commence on April 12, 2012 and reach completion within 42 months (October 12, 2015). It was ultimately completed about 14 months behind schedule (December 12, 2016). The Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project was implemented between 2013 and 2015. In April 2014, three diesel locomotives manufactured by arrived in Ethiopia by sea. Then, in October 2015, the ERC took delivery of 315 locomotives — that carry passengers and freight —  from NORINCO and Metals and Engineering Corporation. On December 13, 2015, 22 electric locomotives, 6 diesel locomotives and 6 passenger carriages arrived in the Port of Djibouti.   * Railway Operations & Management (Project Supervision and Control): On July 28, 2016, CREC and CCECC signed the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway Operation and Management Agreement. The agreement specified that the CREC-CCECC consortium (also known as the CCECC-CREC JV and 中土集团与中铁二局亚吉铁路联营体公司) would manage the railway for 5 years (following construction completion). Then, on December 16, 2015, ERC and Société Djiboutienne de Chemin de Fer (SDCF) established a joint venture called the Ethio-Djibouti Standard Gauge Railway Company (EDR). ERC holds a 75% ownership stake and SDCF holds a 25% ownership stake in EDR. The main purpose of the EDR is to manage the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway (including the maintenance and renewal of all infrastructure and equipment) and to operate freight and passenger transport services on the line from 2024. The December 16, 2015 agreement specified that  CREC and CCECC would operate and maintain the railway for six years from the launch of operations and provide two additional years of technical support during the gradual handover of management duties to EDR from 2024.  * Financial Performance Problems: The project has faced financial problems associated with lower traffic volumes than predicted in the transport forecast and currency exchange rate fluctuations (as the project’s debt was issued in USD, but construction and operation costs, as well as revenues, are denominated in Ethiopian Birr or ETB).  It remains to be seen if the Yali Railway will find a path to commercial viability. The price of a railway passenger ticket was initially set at 30 Ethiopian birr (ETB). However, this price was subsequently deemed too high and reduced to 4 ETB, which means that the railway will generate substantially less ticket revenue than originally planned. Sinosure has reportedly written off $1 billion in losses due to the poor commercial performance of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway. In 2018, the Government of Ethiopia and China Eximbank agreed to restructure the project debt through a 20-year maturity extension and a 4-year grace period extension (see Project ID#61941).  The Government of Djibouti also requested a restructuring of its $491,793,000 buyer's credit loan agreement with China Eximbank for the 100 km Ali Sabieh to Nagad Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project on December 31, 2017.  The Djiboutian authorities reported to the IMF that a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed in 2019 to extend the grace period from 5 years to 10 years, extend maturity of the loan from 15 years to 25 years, and reduce the interest rate from 3.409% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 3% [300 basis points]) to 2.509% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 2.1% [210 basis points]). The Djiboutian authorities also indicated that arrears on interest payments on this loan that had been accumulated during the restructuring discussion (worth 1.2 percent of the country’s GDP) had been restructured—and that they were integrated to the principal and expected to be repaid over the extended amortization period The new terms of the loan reportedly reduced the present value of the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio by 4 percentage points and smoothed total debt service. However, the final loan restructuring agreement (captured via Project ID#85163) was not signed until September 2, 2020. It not only codified the terms and conditions that were first specified in the 2019 MOU, but also sought to improve the performance and profitability of the railway in order to increase revenue generation. The restructuring agreement was ratified into Djiboutian law in February 2021.    * Operational Performance Problems:  Energy supply is not always stable in Ethiopia, due to the variable level of water in the country’s dams. The lack of stable energy supply delayed the start of railway operations, even after construction was complete.  ‘Overvoltage’ problems also led to repeated service interruptions after the railway began commercial operations in early 2018. This is a technical problem where surges in the electrical grid (due to Ethiopia exporting power to its neighbors) lead to overvoltage in the railway transmission line, akin to blowing a fuse. The railway line has also been flooded on several occasions, halting or delaying services. The Ethiopian Government claims that the standards used by the Chinese companies to build the railway did not take flooding into account. CCECC and CREC, however, argue that their standards accounted for potential floods, but that, in the flooded sections, tracks were stolen, causing structural damage to the railroad. Field interview evidence has also revealed a number of accidents involving animals (camels in particular) being hit by trains and killed. As the ERC has paid more than the market price for camels in compensation, there are suspicions that people are pushing their camels in front of trains deliberately. There is a plan is to build a fence along the railway, which should reduce accidents and enable trains to travel faster, from the current 50 km/h to 80 km/h. However, there is a risk that this may in turn create other problems, including interrupting paths used by people and animals. Railway service interruptions have also occurred due to protests, For example, in late July 2021, a group of Somali Region protestors blocked the railway line following an attack by Afar regional militia. The line reopened on August 3, 2021.","1. This project is also known as the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Procurement Project and the Supply of Rolling Stocks, Simulators, Accessories and Related Services Project. The broader Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway is also known as the Djibouti-Ethiopia Railway Project, the Yaji Railway Construction Project, and the Addis Ababa-Mojo-Awash-Dire Dawa-Dewele-Djibouti Railway Project. The Chinese project title is 埃塞俄比亚机车车辆供货项目 or 东非亚吉铁路项目. 2. AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate by adding 3% to the average 6-month LIBOR rate in May 2013 (0.421%). 3. When the commercial contract for the Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was originally signed on October 25, 2011, it was worth $1,639,031,409.00. Its value was increased to $1,841,470,000.00 on November 5, 2012. When the commercial contract for the Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was originally signed on December 16, 2011, it was worth $1,197,400,000.00. Its value was increased to $1,401,800,000.00 on November 2, 2012. 4. The system identification number for the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project in the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP) is 87143552129340. The AMP system identification number for the Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project is 87143319101806.

The railway begins at Sebeta, just outside of Ethiopia's capital of Addis Ababa. The city is served by two stations in its southern outskirts, at Furi-Labu and Indode. The line then runs southeast to Modjo and Adama, both towns located in the Ethiopian Great Rift Valley. At Modjo, a railway junction exists for the planned Modjo–Hawassa Railway. In addition, at Modjo the railway is connected to the Modjo Dry Port, Ethiopia's most important inland dry port and also Ethiopia's main hub for domestic and international freight services. At Adama, the railway turns northeast towards Dire Dawa. At Awash, there is a junction with the Awash–Hara Gebeya Railway, which is under construction as of 2018. Directly after Awash station, the line crosses 60 meters above the Awash River canyon over a 155 meter long bridge, the main bridge of the railway.The railway then proceeds to Dire Dawa, where it turns and heads directly for Djibouti. Crossing the Ethiopia-Djibouti border between Dewale and Ali Sabieh, the line reaches the Djibouti passenger terminal at Nagad railway station, near Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport. In February 2001; the Government of Ethiopia asked CCECC to inspect the line and propose a construction plan. This plan was put on hold for several years due to a lack of funding. After years of continued deterioration due to mismanagement, a 2007 pre-feasibility study indicated that the line needed to be renovated (at a cost of approximately $3.4 billion. The proposed renovation of the railway was designed to include a double track from Addis Ababa to Adama, a single track from Adama to Dewele, a 1035 meter long bridge, the grand bridge at DK42, the 155 meter Awash grand bridge, and a Labu station upgrade. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the Yaji Railway would run passenger trains (at 120 km/hr) and cargo trains (at 80 km/hr).   * Project Implementation:  Construction began in 2012 and the project as a whole had achieved a 50% completion rate by 2014.  Track laying for the railway began in May 2015.  The railway was opened for passenger services on October 4, 2016. Then, on December 31, 2017, Ethiopian Railway Company issued a project handover certificate to CREC and CCECC. The next day, on January 1, 2018, a ceremony was held to mark the beginning of the railway’s commercial operations. Two days later, in January 3, 2018, a two-way passenger train on the Ethiopian section of the railway went into service.  The Yali Railway was the first overseas railway constructed by Chinese enterprises that adhered to international standards (1,435 mm gauge line and electrification at 25 kV) and used Chinese equipment (CSR Zhuzhou for the rolling stock). The Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was originally scheduled (under the terms of the EPC contract) to commence on February 12, 2012 and reach completion within 42 months (August 12, 2015). It was ultimately completed about 15 months behind schedule (November 12, 2016). The Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was originally scheduled (under the terms of the EPC contract) to commence on April 12, 2012 and reach completion within 42 months (October 12, 2015). It was ultimately completed about 14 months behind schedule (December 12, 2016). The Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project was implemented between 2013 and 2015. In April 2014, three diesel locomotives manufactured by arrived in Ethiopia by sea. Then, in October 2015, the ERC took delivery of 315 locomotives — that carry passengers and freight —  from NORINCO and Metals and Engineering Corporation. On December 13, 2015, 22 electric locomotives, 6 diesel locomotives and 6 passenger carriages arrived in the Port of Djibouti.   * Railway Operations & Management (Project Supervision and Control): On July 28, 2016, CREC and CCECC signed the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway Operation and Management Agreement. The agreement specified that the CREC-CCECC consortium (also known as the CCECC-CREC JV and 中土集团与中铁二局亚吉铁路联营体公司) would manage the railway for 5 years (following construction completion). Then, on December 16, 2015, ERC and Société Djiboutienne de Chemin de Fer (SDCF) established a joint venture called the Ethio-Djibouti Standard Gauge Railway Company (EDR). ERC holds a 75% ownership stake and SDCF holds a 25% ownership stake in EDR. The main purpose of the EDR is to manage the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway (including the maintenance and renewal of all infrastructure and equipment) and to operate freight and passenger transport services on the line from 2024. The December 16, 2015 agreement specified that  CREC and CCECC would operate and maintain the railway for six years from the launch of operations and provide two additional years of technical support during the gradual handover of management duties to EDR from 2024.  * Financial Performance Problems: The project has faced financial problems associated with lower traffic volumes than predicted in the transport forecast and currency exchange rate fluctuations (as the project’s debt was issued in USD, but construction and operation costs, as well as revenues, are denominated in Ethiopian Birr or ETB).  It remains to be seen if the Yali Railway will find a path to commercial viability. The price of a railway passenger ticket was initially set at 30 Ethiopian birr (ETB). However, this price was subsequently deemed too high and reduced to 4 ETB, which means that the railway will generate substantially less ticket revenue than originally planned. Sinosure has reportedly written off $1 billion in losses due to the poor commercial performance of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway. In 2018, the Government of Ethiopia and China Eximbank agreed to restructure the project debt through a 20-year maturity extension and a 4-year grace period extension (see Project ID#61941).  The Government of Djibouti also requested a restructuring of its $491,793,000 buyer's credit loan agreement with China Eximbank for the 100 km Ali Sabieh to Nagad Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project on December 31, 2017.  The Djiboutian authorities reported to the IMF that a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed in 2019 to extend the grace period from 5 years to 10 years, extend maturity of the loan from 15 years to 25 years, and reduce the interest rate from 3.409% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 3% [300 basis points]) to 2.509% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 2.1% [210 basis points]). The Djiboutian authorities also indicated that arrears on interest payments on this loan that had been accumulated during the restructuring discussion (worth 1.2 percent of the country’s GDP) had been restructured—and that they were integrated to the principal and expected to be repaid over the extended amortization period The new terms of the loan reportedly reduced the present value of the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio by 4 percentage points and smoothed total debt service. However, the final loan restructuring agreement (captured via Project ID#85163) was not signed until September 2, 2020. It not only codified the terms and conditions that were first specified in the 2019 MOU, but also sought to improve the performance and profitability of the railway in order to increase revenue generation. The restructuring agreement was ratified into Djiboutian law in February 2021.    * Operational Performance Problems:  Energy supply is not always stable in Ethiopia, due to the variable level of water in the country’s dams. The lack of stable energy supply delayed the start of railway operations, even after construction was complete.  ‘Overvoltage’ problems also led to repeated service interruptions after the railway began commercial operations in early 2018. This is a technical problem where surges in the electrical grid (due to Ethiopia exporting power to its neighbors) lead to overvoltage in the railway transmission line, akin to blowing a fuse. The railway line has also been flooded on several occasions, halting or delaying services. The Ethiopian Government claims that the standards used by the Chinese companies to build the railway did not take flooding into account. CCECC and CREC, however, argue that their standards accounted for potential floods, but that, in the flooded sections, tracks were stolen, causing structural damage to the railroad. Field interview evidence has also revealed a number of accidents involving animals (camels in particular) being hit by trains and killed. As the ERC has paid more than the market price for camels in compensation, there are suspicions that people are pushing their camels in front of trains deliberately. There is a plan is to build a fence along the railway, which should reduce accidents and enable trains to travel faster, from the current 50 km/h to 80 km/h. However, there is a risk that this may in turn create other problems, including interrupting paths used by people and animals. Railway service interruptions have also occurred due to protests, For example, in late July 2021, a group of Somali Region protestors blocked the railway line following an attack by Afar regional militia. The line reopened on August 3, 2021.",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,General Infrastructure,"The project primarily involves the construction and operation of a railway line, which is general infrastructure without clear direct environmental or energy transition impacts.","Construction of a 750.224 km railway line, acquisition of rolling stock, and focus on passenger and freight transport services"

The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $981,260,000 China Eximbank loan to finance 70% of the cost of a $1,401,800,000 commercial (EPC) contract between the ERC and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), which was signed on December 16, 2011 (and modified on modified on November 2, 2012, February 7, 2013 and March 8, 2013) to support the construction of a 339 km section of the railway that runs from Miesso (Meiso) to Dewelle (Dewanle) on Ethiopia's border with Djibouti. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $220,471,000 China Eximbank loan to finance approximately 85% of a $259 million commercial contract between China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) and the ERC, which was signed in March 2013 to support the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project. The purpose of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 750.224 km railway from Sebeta to Nagad. The purpose of the Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 329.065 km railway section from Sebeta to Meiso (Mieso) that consists of two subsections: a 113.836 km railway subsection from Sebeta to Adama and a 215.229 km subsection from Adama to Meiso (Mieso). The purpose of the Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 339.182 km railway section from Meiso (Mieso) or to Dewelle (Dewanle/Dawanle) on Ethiopia's border with Djibouti. The line runs from Mieso to the east — via Mulu, Afdem, Bike,Gota, Erer, and Hurso — to Dire-Dawa. It then turns to the north before reaching Arawa, and then runs from Adigala to Lasarat, Aysha, Dawanle and the border between Ethiopia and Djibouti.

This is a technical problem where surges in the electrical grid (due to Ethiopia exporting power to its neighbors) lead to overvoltage in the railway transmission line, akin to blowing a fuse. The railway line has also been flooded on several occasions, halting or delaying services. The Ethiopian Government claims that the standards used by the Chinese companies to build the railway did not take flooding into account. CCECC and CREC, however, argue that their standards accounted for potential floods, but that, in the flooded sections, tracks were stolen, causing structural damage to the railroad. Field interview evidence has also revealed a number of accidents involving animals (camels in particular) being hit by trains and killed. As the ERC has paid more than the market price for camels in compensation, there are suspicions that people are pushing their camels in front of trains deliberately. There is a plan is to build a fence along the railway, which should reduce accidents and enable trains to travel faster, from the current 50 km/h to 80 km/h. However, there is a risk that this may in turn create other problems, including interrupting paths used by people and animals. Railway service interruptions have also occurred due to protests, For example, in late July 2021, a group of Somali Region protestors blocked the railway line following an attack by Afar regional militia. The line reopened on August 3, 2021.","1.

China Eximbank provides $981 million buyer’s credit loan for the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project (Linked to Project ID#30171, #70086, #70083, #61941, #85163)

# Description
On May 15, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed a $2,490,760,000 buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement for the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project. The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 6-year grace period, and an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3% margin. The loan was also backed by a credit insurance policy from China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation (SINOSURE). China Eximbank provided the loan in three separate loan tranches. The first tranche is worth $1,289,029,000 (captured via Project ID#70086) and it supported the Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project. The second tranche is worth $981,260,000 (captured via Project ID#70085) and it supported the Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project.  The third tranche is worth $220,471,000 (captured via Project ID#70083) and it supported the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $1,289,029,000 China Eximbank loan tranche to finance 70% of the cost of a $1,841,470,000.00 commercial (EPC) contract between the Ethiopian Railway Corporation (ERC) and China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), which was signed on October 25, 2011 (and modified on November 5, 2012, February 7, 2013, and March 15, 2013) to support the construction of a 329 km Sebeta (Addis Ababa) to Miesso section of the railway. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $981,260,000 China Eximbank loan to finance 70% of the cost of a $1,401,800,000 commercial (EPC) contract between the ERC and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), which was signed on December 16, 2011 (and modified on modified on November 2, 2012, February 7, 2013 and March 8, 2013) to support the construction of a 339 km section of the railway that runs from Miesso (Meiso) to Dewelle (Dewanle) on Ethiopia's border with Djibouti. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $220,471,000 China Eximbank loan to finance approximately 85% of a $259 million commercial contract between China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) and the ERC, which was signed in March 2013 to support the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project. The purpose of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 750.224 km railway from Sebeta to Nagad. The purpose of the Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 329.065 km railway section from Sebeta to Meiso (Mieso) that consists of two subsections: a 113.836 km railway subsection from Sebeta to Adama and a 215.229 km subsection from Adama to Meiso (Mieso). The purpose of the Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 339.182 km railway section from Meiso (Mieso) or to Dewelle (Dewanle/Dawanle) on Ethiopia's border with Djibouti. The line runs from Mieso to the east — via Mulu, Afdem, Bike,Gota, Erer, and Hurso — to Dire-Dawa. It then turns to the north before reaching Arawa, and then runs from Adigala to Lasarat, Aysha, Dawanle and the border between Ethiopia and Djibouti.  The purpose of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project was to acquire 5 electric locomotives, 6 diesel locomotives, 30 railway passenger cars and 1,100 railway freight cars for the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway.  * Loan Disbursements: According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $1,289,029,000 (ETB 24,004,264,432) loan tranche for the Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project achieved a 104% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 14 loan disbursements (worth ETB 24,905,259,256) between 2014 and 2020: an ETB 1,062,992,126 disbursement on July 8, 2014, an ETB 5,420,000,000 disbursement on October 8, 2014, an ETB 2,303,030,303 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 5,597,115,886 disbursement on April 8, 2015, an ETB 1,808,159 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 1,740,583,177 disbursement on January 7, 2016, an ETB 825,731,677 disbursement on April 7, 2016, an ETB 2,165,153,034 disbursement on July 7, 2016, an ETB 143,690,666 disbursement on October 7, 2016, an ETB 923,238,863 disbursement on January 7, 2017, an ETB 325,274,645 disbursement on April 7, 2017, an ETB 372,159,087 disbursement on July 7, 2017, an ETB  1,422,471,270 disbursement on September 20, 2017, and an ETB 2,602,010,364 disbursement on November 12, 2020.

The railway begins at Sebeta, just outside of Ethiopia's capital of Addis Ababa. The city is served by two stations in its southern outskirts, at Furi-Labu and Indode. The line then runs southeast to Modjo and Adama, both towns located in the Ethiopian Great Rift Valley. At Modjo, a railway junction exists for the planned Modjo–Hawassa Railway. In addition, at Modjo the railway is connected to the Modjo Dry Port, Ethiopia's most important inland dry port and also Ethiopia's main hub for domestic and international freight services. At Adama, the railway turns northeast towards Dire Dawa. At Awash, there is a junction with the Awash–Hara Gebeya Railway, which is under construction as of 2018. Directly after Awash station, the line crosses 60 meters above the Awash River canyon over a 155 meter long bridge, the main bridge of the railway.The railway then proceeds to Dire Dawa, where it turns and heads directly for Djibouti. Crossing the Ethiopia-Djibouti border between Dewale and Ali Sabieh, the line reaches the Djibouti passenger terminal at Nagad railway station, near Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport. In February 2001; the Government of Ethiopia asked CCECC to inspect the line and propose a construction plan. This plan was put on hold for several years due to a lack of funding. After years of continued deterioration due to mismanagement, a 2007 pre-feasibility study indicated that the line needed to be renovated (at a cost of approximately $3.4 billion. The proposed renovation of the railway was designed to include a double track from Addis Ababa to Adama, a single track from Adama to Dewele, a 1035 meter long bridge, the grand bridge at DK42, the 155 meter Awash grand bridge, and a Labu station upgrade. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the Yaji Railway would run passenger trains (at 120 km/hr) and cargo trains (at 80 km/hr).   * Project Implementation:  Construction began in 2012 and the project as a whole had achieved a 50% completion rate by 2014.  Track laying for the railway began in May 2015.  The railway was opened for passenger services on October 4, 2016. Then, on December 31, 2017, Ethiopian Railway Company issued a project handover certificate to CREC and CCECC. The next day, on January 1, 2018, a ceremony was held to mark the beginning of the railway’s commercial operations. Two days later, in January 3, 2018, a two-way passenger train on the Ethiopian section of the railway went into service.  The Yali Railway was the first overseas railway constructed by Chinese enterprises that adhered to international standards (1,435 mm gauge line and electrification at 25 kV) and used Chinese equipment (CSR Zhuzhou for the rolling stock). The Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was originally scheduled (under the terms of the EPC contract) to commence on February 12, 2012 and reach completion within 42 months (August 12, 2015). It was ultimately completed about 15 months behind schedule (November 12, 2016).  The Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was originally scheduled (under the terms of the EPC contract) to commence on April 12, 2012 and reach completion within 42 months (October 12, 2015). It was ultimately completed about 14 months behind schedule (December 12, 2016). The Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project was implemented between 2013 and 2015.  In April 2014, three diesel locomotives manufactured by arrived in Ethiopia by sea. Then, in October 2015, the ERC took delivery of 315 locomotives — that carry passengers and freight —  from NORINCO and Metals and Engineering Corporation. On December 13, 2015, 22 electric locomotives, 6 diesel locomotives and 6 passenger carriages arrived in the Port of Djibouti.   * Railway Operations & Management (Project Supervision and Control): On July 28, 2016, CREC and CCECC signed the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway Operation and Management Agreement. The agreement specified that the CREC-CCECC consortium (also known as the CCECC-CREC JV and 中土集团与中铁二局亚吉铁路联营体公司) would manage the railway for 5 years (following construction completion). Then, on December 16, 2015, ERC and Société Djiboutienne de Chemin de Fer (SDCF) established a joint venture called the Ethio-Djibouti Standard Gauge Railway Company (EDR). ERC holds a 75% ownership stake and SDCF holds a 25% ownership stake in EDR. The main purpose of the EDR is to manage the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway (including the maintenance and renewal of all infrastructure and equipment) and to operate freight and passenger transport services on the line from 2024. The December 16, 2015 agreement specified that  CREC and CCECC would operate and maintain the railway for six years from the launch of operations and provide two additional years of technical support during the gradual handover of management duties to EDR from 2024.  * Financial Performance Problems: The project has faced financial problems associated with lower traffic volumes than predicted in the transport forecast and currency exchange rate fluctuations (as the project’s debt was issued in USD, but construction and operation costs as well as revenues are denominated in Ethiopian Birr or ETB).  It remains to be seen if the Yali Railway will find a path to commercial viability. The price of a railway passenger ticket was initially set at 30 Ethiopian birr (ETB). However, this price was subsequently deemed too high and reduced to 4 ETB, which means that the railway will generate substantially less ticket revenue than originally planned. Sinosure has reportedly written off $1 billion in losses due to the poor commercial performance of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway. In 2018, the Government of Ethiopia and China Eximbank agreed to restructure the project debt through a 20-year maturity extension and a 4-year grace period extension (see Project ID#61941).  The Government of Djibouti also requested a restructuring of its $491,793,000 buyer's credit loan agreement with China Eximbank for the 100 km Ali Sabieh to Nagad Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project on December 31, 2017.  The Djiboutian authorities reported to the IMF that a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed in 2019 to extend the grace period from 5 years to 10 years, extend maturity of the loan from 15 years to 25 years, and reduce the interest rate from 3.409% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 3% [300 basis points]) to 2.509% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 2.1% [210 basis points]). The Djiboutian authorities also indicated that arrears on interest payments on this loan that had been accumulated during the restructuring discussion (worth 1.2 percent of the country’s GDP) had been restructured—and that they were integrated to the principal and expected to be repaid over the extended amortization period The new terms of the loan reportedly reduced the present value of the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio by 4 percentage points and smoothed total debt service. However, the final loan restructuring agreement (captured via Project ID#85163) was not signed until September 2, 2020. It not only codified the terms and conditions that were first specified in the 2019 MOU, but also sought to improve the performance and profitability of the railway in order to increase revenue generation. The restructuring agreement was ratified into Djiboutian law in February 2021.    * Operational Performance Problems:  Energy supply is not always stable in Ethiopia, due to the variable level of water in the country’s dams. The lack of stable energy supply delayed the start of railway operations, even after construction was complete.  ‘Overvoltage’ problems also led to repeated service interruptions after the railway began commercial operations in early 2018. This is a technical problem where surges in the electrical grid (due to Ethiopia exporting power to its neighbors) lead to overvoltage in the railway transmission line, akin to blowing a fuse. The railway line has also been flooded on several occasions, halting or delaying services. The Ethiopian Government claims that the standards used by the Chinese companies to build the railway did not take flooding into account. CCECC and CREC, however, argue that their standards accounted for potential floods, but that, in the flooded sections, tracks were stolen, causing structural damage to the railroad.

The railway begins at Sebeta, just outside of Ethiopia's capital of Addis Ababa. The city is served by two stations in its southern outskirts, at Furi-Labu and Indode. The line then runs southeast to Modjo and Adama, both towns located in the Ethiopian Great Rift Valley. At Modjo, a railway junction exists for the planned Modjo–Hawassa Railway. In addition, at Modjo the railway is connected to the Modjo Dry Port, Ethiopia's most important inland dry port and also Ethiopia's main hub for domestic and international freight services. At Adama, the railway turns northeast towards Dire Dawa. At Awash, there is a junction with the Awash–Hara Gebeya Railway, which is under construction as of 2018. Directly after Awash station, the line crosses 60 meters above the Awash River canyon over a 155 meter long bridge, the main bridge of the railway.The railway then proceeds to Dire Dawa, where it turns and heads directly for Djibouti. Crossing the Ethiopia-Djibouti border between Dewale and Ali Sabieh, the line reaches the Djibouti passenger terminal at Nagad railway station, near Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport. In February 2001; the Government of Ethiopia asked CCECC to inspect the line and propose a construction plan. This plan was put on hold for several years due to a lack of funding. After years of continued deterioration due to mismanagement, a 2007 pre-feasibility study indicated that the line needed to be renovated (at a cost of approximately $3.4 billion. The proposed renovation of the railway was designed to include a double track from Addis Ababa to Adama, a single track from Adama to Dewele, a 1035 meter long bridge, the grand bridge at DK42, the 155 meter Awash grand bridge, and a Labu station upgrade. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the Yaji Railway would run passenger trains (at 120 km/hr) and cargo trains (at 80 km/hr).   * Project Implementation:  Construction began in 2012 and the project as a whole had achieved a 50% completion rate by 2014.  Track laying for the railway began in May 2015.  The railway was opened for passenger services on October 4, 2016. Then, on December 31, 2017, Ethiopian Railway Company issued a project handover certificate to CREC and CCECC. The next day, on January 1, 2018, a ceremony was held to mark the beginning of the railway’s commercial operations. Two days later, in January 3, 2018, a two-way passenger train on the Ethiopian section of the railway went into service.  The Yali Railway was the first overseas railway constructed by Chinese enterprises that adhered to international standards (1,435 mm gauge line and electrification at 25 kV) and used Chinese equipment (CSR Zhuzhou for the rolling stock). The Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was originally scheduled (under the terms of the EPC contract) to commence on February 12, 2012 and reach completion within 42 months (August 12, 2015). It was ultimately completed about 15 months behind schedule (November 12, 2016).  The Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was originally scheduled (under the terms of the EPC contract) to commence on April 12, 2012 and reach completion within 42 months (October 12, 2015). It was ultimately completed about 14 months behind schedule (December 12, 2016). The Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project was implemented between 2013 and 2015.  In April 2014, three diesel locomotives manufactured by arrived in Ethiopia by sea. Then, in October 2015, the ERC took delivery of 315 locomotives — that carry passengers and freight —  from NORINCO and Metals and Engineering Corporation. On December 13, 2015, 22 electric locomotives, 6 diesel locomotives and 6 passenger carriages arrived in the Port of Djibouti.   * Railway Operations & Management (Project Supervision and Control): On July 28, 2016, CREC and CCECC signed the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway Operation and Management Agreement. The agreement specified that the CREC-CCECC consortium (also known as the CCECC-CREC JV and 中土集团与中铁二局亚吉铁路联营体公司) would manage the railway for 5 years (following construction completion). Then, on December 16, 2015, ERC and Société Djiboutienne de Chemin de Fer (SDCF) established a joint venture called the Ethio-Djibouti Standard Gauge Railway Company (EDR). ERC holds a 75% ownership stake and SDCF holds a 25% ownership stake in EDR. The main purpose of the EDR is to manage the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway (including the maintenance and renewal of all infrastructure and equipment) and to operate freight and passenger transport services on the line from 2024. The December 16, 2015 agreement specified that  CREC and CCECC would operate and maintain the railway for six years from the launch of operations and provide two additional years of technical support during the gradual handover of management duties to EDR from 2024.  * Financial Performance Problems: The project has faced financial problems associated with lower traffic volumes than predicted in the transport forecast and currency exchange rate fluctuations (as the project’s debt was issued in USD, but construction and operation costs as well as revenues are denominated in Ethiopian Birr or ETB).  It remains to be seen if the Yali Railway will find a path to commercial viability. The price of a railway passenger ticket was initially set at 30 Ethiopian birr (ETB). However, this price was subsequently deemed too high and reduced to 4 ETB, which means that the railway will generate substantially less ticket revenue than originally planned. Sinosure has reportedly written off $1 billion in losses due to the poor commercial performance of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway. In 2018, the Government of Ethiopia and China Eximbank agreed to restructure the project debt through a 20-year maturity extension and a 4-year grace period extension (see Project ID#61941).  The Government of Djibouti also requested a restructuring of its $491,793,000 buyer's credit loan agreement with China Eximbank for the 100 km Ali Sabieh to Nagad Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project on December 31, 2017.  The Djiboutian authorities reported to the IMF that a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed in 2019 to extend the grace period from 5 years to 10 years, extend maturity of the loan from 15 years to 25 years, and reduce the interest rate from 3.409% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 3% [300 basis points]) to 2.509% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 2.1% [210 basis points]). The Djiboutian authorities also indicated that arrears on interest payments on this loan that had been accumulated during the restructuring discussion (worth 1.2 percent of the country’s GDP) had been restructured—and that they were integrated to the principal and expected to be repaid over the extended amortization period The new terms of the loan reportedly reduced the present value of the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio by 4 percentage points and smoothed total debt service. However, the final loan restructuring agreement (captured via Project ID#85163) was not signed until September 2, 2020. It not only codified the terms and conditions that were first specified in the 2019 MOU, but also sought to improve the performance and profitability of the railway in order to increase revenue generation. The restructuring agreement was ratified into Djiboutian law in February 2021.    * Operational Performance Problems:  Energy supply is not always stable in Ethiopia, due to the variable level of water in the country’s dams. The lack of stable energy supply delayed the start of railway operations, even after construction was complete.  ‘Overvoltage’ problems also led to repeated service interruptions after the railway began commercial operations in early 2018. This is a technical problem where surges in the electrical grid (due to Ethiopia exporting power to its neighbors) lead to overvoltage in the railway transmission line, akin to blowing a fuse. The railway line has also been flooded on several occasions, halting or delaying services. The Ethiopian Government claims that the standards used by the Chinese companies to build the railway did not take flooding into account. CCECC and CREC, however, argue that their standards accounted for potential floods, but that, in the flooded sections, tracks were stolen, causing structural damage to the railroad. Field interview evidence has also revealed a number of accidents involving animals (camels in particular) being hit by trains and killed. As the ERC has paid more than the market price for camels in compensation, there are suspicions that people are pushing their camels in front of trains deliberately. There is a plan is to build a fence along the railway, which should reduce accidents and enable trains to travel faster, from the current 50 km/h to 80 km/h. However, there is a risk that this may in turn create other problems, including interrupting paths used by people and animals. Railway service interruptions have also occurred due to protests, For example, in late July 2021, a group of Somali Region protestors blocked the railway line following an attack by Afar regional militia. The line reopened on August 3, 2021.","1.

# Description
On May 15, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed a $2,490,760,000 buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement for the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project. The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 6-year grace period, and an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3% margin. The loan was also backed by a credit insurance policy from China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation (SINOSURE). China Eximbank provided the loan in three separate loan tranches. The first tranche is worth $1,289,029,000 (captured via Project ID#70086) and it supported the Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project. The second tranche is worth $981,260,000 (captured via Project ID#70085) and it supported the Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project.  The third tranche is worth $220,471,000 (captured via Project ID#70083) and it supported the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $1,289,029,000 China Eximbank loan tranche to finance 70% of the cost of a $1,841,470,000.00 commercial (EPC) contract between the Ethiopian Railway Corporation (ERC) and China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), which was signed on October 25, 2011 (and modified on November 5, 2012, February 7, 2013, and March 15, 2013) to support the construction of a 329 km Sebeta (Addis Ababa) to Miesso section of the railway. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $981,260,000 China Eximbank loan to finance 70% of the cost of a $1,401,800,000 commercial (EPC) contract between the ERC and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), which was signed on December 16, 2011 (and modified on modified on November 2, 2012, February 7, 2013 and March 8, 2013) to support the construction of a 339 km section of the railway that runs from Miesso (Meiso) to Dewelle (Dewanle) on Ethiopia's border with Djibouti. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $220,471,000 China Eximbank loan to finance approximately 85% of a $259 million commercial contract between China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) and the ERC, which was signed in March 2013 to support the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project. The purpose of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 750.224 km railway from Sebeta to Nagad. The purpose of the Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 329.065 km railway section from Sebeta to Meiso (Mieso) that consists of two subsections: a 113.836 km railway subsection from Sebeta to Adama and a 215.229 km subsection from Adama to Meiso (Mieso). The purpose of the Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 339.182 km railway section from Meiso (Mieso) or to Dewelle (Dewanle/Dawanle) on Ethiopia's border with Djibouti. The line runs from Mieso to the east — via Mulu, Afdem, Bike,Gota, Erer, and Hurso — to Dire-Dawa. It then turns to the north before reaching Arawa, and then runs from Adigala to Lasarat, Aysha, Dawanle and the border between Ethiopia and Djibouti.  The purpose of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project was to acquire 5 electric locomotives, 6 diesel locomotives, 30 railway passenger cars and 1,100 railway freight cars for the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway.  * Loan Disbursements: According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $1,289,029,000 (ETB 24,004,264,432) loan tranche for the Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project achieved a 104% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 14 loan disbursements (worth ETB 24,905,259,256) between 2014 and 2020: an ETB 1,062,992,126 disbursement on July 8, 2014, an ETB 5,420,000,000 disbursement on October 8, 2014, an ETB 2,303,030,303 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 5,597,115,886 disbursement on April 8, 2015, an ETB 1,808,159 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 1,740,583,177 disbursement on January 7, 2016, an ETB 825,731,677 disbursement on April 7, 2016, an ETB 2,165,153,034 disbursement on July 7, 2016, an ETB 143,690,666 disbursement on October 7, 2016, an ETB 923,238,863 disbursement on January 7, 2017, an ETB 325,274,645 disbursement on April 7, 2017, an ETB 372,159,087 disbursement on July 7, 2017, an ETB  1,422,471,270 disbursement on September 20, 2017, and an ETB 2,602,010,364 disbursement on November 12, 2020.

The main purpose of the EDR is to manage the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway (including the maintenance and renewal of all infrastructure and equipment) and to operate freight and passenger transport services on the line from 2024. The December 16, 2015 agreement specified that  CREC and CCECC would operate and maintain the railway for six years from the launch of operations and provide two additional years of technical support during the gradual handover of management duties to EDR from 2024.  * Financial Performance Problems: The project has faced financial problems associated with lower traffic volumes than predicted in the transport forecast and currency exchange rate fluctuations (as the project’s debt was issued in USD, but construction and operation costs as well as revenues are denominated in Ethiopian Birr or ETB).  It remains to be seen if the Yali Railway will find a path to commercial viability. The price of a railway passenger ticket was initially set at 30 Ethiopian birr (ETB). However, this price was subsequently deemed too high and reduced to 4 ETB, which means that the railway will generate substantially less ticket revenue than originally planned. Sinosure has reportedly written off $1 billion in losses due to the poor commercial performance of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway. In 2018, the Government of Ethiopia and China Eximbank agreed to restructure the project debt through a 20-year maturity extension and a 4-year grace period extension (see Project ID#61941).  The Government of Djibouti also requested a restructuring of its $491,793,000 buyer's credit loan agreement with China Eximbank for the 100 km Ali Sabieh to Nagad Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project on December 31, 2017.  The Djiboutian authorities reported to the IMF that a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed in 2019 to extend the grace period from 5 years to 10 years, extend maturity of the loan from 15 years to 25 years, and reduce the interest rate from 3.409% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 3% [300 basis points]) to 2.509% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 2.1% [210 basis points]). The Djiboutian authorities also indicated that arrears on interest payments on this loan that had been accumulated during the restructuring discussion (worth 1.2 percent of the country’s GDP) had been restructured—and that they were integrated to the principal and expected to be repaid over the extended amortization period The new terms of the loan reportedly reduced the present value of the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio by 4 percentage points and smoothed total debt service. However, the final loan restructuring agreement (captured via Project ID#85163) was not signed until September 2, 2020. It not only codified the terms and conditions that were first specified in the 2019 MOU, but also sought to improve the performance and profitability of the railway in order to increase revenue generation. The restructuring agreement was ratified into Djiboutian law in February 2021.    * Operational Performance Problems:  Energy supply is not always stable in Ethiopia, due to the variable level of water in the country’s dams. The lack of stable energy supply delayed the start of railway operations, even after construction was complete.  ‘Overvoltage’ problems also led to repeated service interruptions after the railway began commercial operations in early 2018. This is a technical problem where surges in the electrical grid (due to Ethiopia exporting power to its neighbors) lead to overvoltage in the railway transmission line, akin to blowing a fuse. The railway line has also been flooded on several occasions, halting or delaying services. The Ethiopian Government claims that the standards used by the Chinese companies to build the railway did not take flooding into account. CCECC and CREC, however, argue that their standards accounted for potential floods, but that, in the flooded sections, tracks were stolen, causing structural damage to the railroad. Field interview evidence has also revealed a number of accidents involving animals (camels in particular) being hit by trains and killed. As the ERC has paid more than the market price for camels in compensation, there are suspicions that people are pushing their camels in front of trains deliberately. There is a plan is to build a fence along the railway, which should reduce accidents and enable trains to travel faster, from the current 50 km/h to 80 km/h. However, there is a risk that this may in turn create other problems, including interrupting paths used by people and animals. Railway service interruptions have also occurred due to protests, For example, in late July 2021, a group of Somali Region protestors blocked the railway line following an attack by Afar regional militia. The line reopened on August 3, 2021.",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,General Infrastructure,"The project primarily involves the construction and operation of a railway for transportation purposes, which does not have a direct environmental or energy transition impact.","Construction of a 750.224 km railway connecting Addis Ababa to Djibouti, including rolling stock supply and infrastructure development."
86927,COMMUNICATIONS,[Uncancelled Portion] China Eximbank provides $800 million export seller's credit to ZTE for on-lending to Ethio telecom in support of Telecom Transformation and Expansion 6 Circles Project (Linked to Project ID#30884),"On January 10, 2013, ZTE Corporation and Ethio telecom — a state-owned telecommunications company in Ethiopia — signed an $800 million supplier credit agreement for the Telecom Transformation and Expansion 6 Circles Project. On the same day, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. and Ethio telecom signed an $800 million supplier credit agreement for the Telecom Transformation and Expansion 7 Circles Project.  ZTE Corporation and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. reportedly secured a $1.6 billion export seller’s credit from China Eximbank and then used the proceeds of the export seller’s credit to on-lend to Ethio telecom.   Both supplier credits carried identical borrowing terms:  a 13 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, and an annual interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin. The interest rate that applies to each supplier credit (1.988%) was calculated by taking the average 6-month LIBOR rate during the month (January 2013) when the supplier credit agreement was issued (0.488%) and adding a 1.5% margin. The borrower was to use the supplier credit proceeds to finance a $1.6 billion commercial contract it signed with ZTE Corporation and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.  in July 2013 for the Telecom Transformation and Expansion Circles Project. The Government of Ethiopia did not issue a sovereign guarantee in support of the supplier credit issued by Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.  or the supplier credit issued by ZTE Corporation.   The purpose of the Telecom Transformation and Expansion Circles Project was to (a) provide fourth generation (4G) technology, a broadband technology allowing browsing speed of 100mb per second in Addis Ababa; and (b) enable third generation (3G) services across the country. Ethio telecom divided the country into 12 infrastructural zones (‘circles’), and made one vendor (Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.) responsible for 7 circles and another vendor (ZTE Corporation) responsible for 6 circles. Therefore, the project consisted of two sub-projects: the Telecom Transformation and Expansion 7 Circles Project (implemented by Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.) and the the Telecom Transformation and Expansion 6 Circles Project (partially implemented by ZTE Corporation).   The sub-project overseen by Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. entered implementation without any known contractual disputes with the project owner (Ethio telecom). However, the sub-project overseen by ZTE Corporation was plagued by a contractual dispute with the project owner. According to Deputy Prime Minister Debretsion Gebremichael, ZTE Corporation declined to work on the swapping of an old network in the capital city of Addis Ababa and asked for an additional $150 million for the service. Mekuria Haile, Ethiopia’s Minister of Urban Development and Housing Construction (and Chair of the Ethio telecom Board) eventually terminated Ethio telecom’s agreement with ZTE Corporation in April 2014.   Then, Ethio telecom approached Nokia and Ericsson with an offer to work on the project together and take responsibility for three circles each. This resulted in a deal with Ericsson. According to Debretsion Gebremichael, “Nokia did not respond to our offer, so we continued negotiations with Ericsson.’’ Ericsson proposed a $550 million deal for four circles (the south, south west, south east and south south circles) and a credit agreement with a 10 year maturity and a 7.5% interest rate. The interest rate and the maturity were adjusted after negotiation between the two parties, but they both remained higher than the interest rate and the maturity in the supplier credit agreement with ZTE.   After ZTE learned that the Government of Ethiopia was negotiating with Ericsson, it requested to work on the project again by agreeing to include the network swapping in the initial project cost. Hours before Andulem Admassie, chief executive officer (CEO) of Ethio telecom, and Rafiah Ibrahim, president of Ericsson for the Middle East and North East Africa region, finalized a deal for the four circles sub-project, ZTE Corporation and Ethio telecom signed a new agreement that gave it responsible for the two remaining circles (east and middle east circles).   Given that the Ericsson deal ultimately involved the provision of a $550 million credit for four of the six circles in the original $800 million sub-project, AidData assumes for the time being that the $800 million supplier credit agreement with ZTE Corporation was revised to $250 million.
