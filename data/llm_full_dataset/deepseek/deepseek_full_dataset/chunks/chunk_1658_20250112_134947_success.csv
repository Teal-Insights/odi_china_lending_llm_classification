The Ministry of Finance of the Government of Sri Lanka then used the proceeds from the BCL and PBC to on-lend to Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), which is a state-owned electricity company that controls all major functions of electricity generation, transmission, distribution and retailing in Sri Lanka. This project involved the installation of a 300MW coal power plant, a jetty for coal handling, and transmission lines from Norochcholai to Veyangoda and substation at Veyangoda. China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. A project inauguration ceremony took place on May 11, 2006. Phase I construction began on July 23, 2007. The first 300-megawatt phase was completed and ceremonially commissioned by President Mahinda Rajapaksa on March 22, 2011.
