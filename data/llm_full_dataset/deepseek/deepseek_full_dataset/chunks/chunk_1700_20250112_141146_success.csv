This project is also known as Phase 1 of the Telecom Network Expansion Project or the GSM/GPRS Expansion Project. The Chinese project title is 多哥移动一期扩容项目. 2. For the time being, AidData has identified the Government of Togo as the borrower. However, there are some indications that Togo Cellulaire (Togocel), which was wholly owned by the Government of Togo until 2019 and is now co-owned by Axian Group & Emerging Capital (51% equity stake) and the Government of Togo (49% equity stake), may have been the primary borrower or secondary borrower (through an on-lending arrangement with the Government of Togo). This issue merits further investigation.3. Sources are inconsistent regarding the commitment year; some indicate 2005, while others point to 2004. This issue warrants further investigation.4. The face value of this loan is not reported by any of the underlying sources. AidData estimates that the face value by taking 100% of the value of the underlying commercial contract, as this project was likely financed with a Government Concessional Loan (GCL) from China Eximbank.5.

Then, on April 8, 2004, the Tunisian Parliament passed a law, approving the interest-free loan. In addition to the Chinese Government, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development provided a $28 million loan for this project in 2000. The primary purpose of this project was to construct a dam on the Kébir River near the town of Tabarka (Dabarka) within the Gafsa Governorate  (ولاية قفصة‎) to address irrigation and residential water shortages in the region. It consisted of 3 components: the construction of a clay core rockfill dam (with water storage capacity of 64 million cubic meters), the construction of a spillway tunnel, and the construction of a water pipeline. The dam was designed to be 70 meters high and 10 meters wide. Its crest was designed to be 560 meters long. Upon completion, the dam was designed to transport 35 million cubic meters of water per year to the Sidi Barrak Reservoir and reduce the risk of flooding within the Gafsa Governorate. China International Water & Electric Corporation (CWE) was the contractor responsible for implementation. Tunisia's Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources, as the owner of the dam, was the ultimate beneficiary of this project and provided implementation support.
