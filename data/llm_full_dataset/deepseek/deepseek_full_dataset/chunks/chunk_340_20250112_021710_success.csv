AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate by adding 3% to the average 6-month LIBOR rate in February 2019 (2.735%). 2. A pre-export finance (PXF) facility is an arrangement in which a commodity producer gets up-front cash from a customer in return for a promise to repay the customer with that commodity (possibly at a discount) in the future. PXF funds may be advanced by a lender or syndicate of lenders to a commodity producer to assist the company in meeting either its working capital needs (for example, to cover the purchase of raw materials and costs associated with processing, storage and transport) or its capital investment needs (for example, investment in plant and machinery and other elements of infrastructure). PXF facilities are usually secured by (1) an assignment of rights by the producer under an ‘offtake contract’ (i.e., a sale and purchase contract between the producer and a buyer of that producer of goods or commodities), and (2) a collection account charge over a bank account into which proceeds due to the producer from the buyer of the goods or commodities under the offtake contract are credited. There are two key documents in prepayment finance transactions: a contract providing for the advance payment by the offtaker to the producer for the purchase of goods/commodities (the 'Prepayment Contract'), and a loan agreement between a lender and the offtaker (the 'Offtaker Loan Agreement') under which the advance payment is financed. 3.

Per Klabin's Quarterly Information Report at September 30, 2020, the financing from BID Invest and IFC is collateralized by the industrial plants in Correia Pinto - SC and Telêmaco Borba - PR.   The Puma II project is to be completed in two phases, with the first increasing the existing Puma I unit's capacity by adding an additional kraftliner paper machine (PM 27) and pulp-making (fiberline) machine. The second phase originally was to add another new fiberline machine and kraftliner machine (PM 28), but was switched to a coated board machine instead of kraftliner. The Puma I unit was also partially financed by IDB, and reached completion in September 2016. Puma II will increase Klabin's production in their Ortigueira location by 920,000 tons per year.

For more specific information on the specific machinery to be added and the capacity of the individual parts of Puma II, see the Environmental and Social Review Summary (ESRS) published by IDB Invest.  According to its press releases, Klabin received the installation license for the Puma II project in April 2019 and signed a Protocol of Intent with the State of Paraná government on December 17, 2019 regarding implementation details. Phase 1 construction began July 3, 2019. Originally, Phase 1 completion was scheduled for May 2021 and Phase 2 for 2023 (ESRS, Klabin Quarterly Financial Statements Q1 2020). There were delays in implementation due to COVID, as construction was suspended in or about March 23, 2020, and began again at a slower pace around May 2020.

Per the Quarter 1 2022 Klabin financial documents, the construction phase of the second paper machine was 32% complete, according to measurements made on 04/17/2022. Startup is forecast for the second quarter of 2023. By the end of March 2022, a total of R$ 8.489 billion across all loans had been disbursed for the project.  Klabin listed the following companies as partners in project implementation for the first phase: Andritz, Confab Industrial, Veolia HPD, Siemens, SUEZ Water Technologies & Solutions, Valmet, and Pöyry.   According to IDB Invest, Klabin is the largest paper producer in Latin America, and the largest exporter and recycler of packaging paper in Brazil.
