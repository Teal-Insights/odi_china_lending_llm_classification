The debt resulted from an agreement during the 1990s in which Sinochem delivered 14.6 million barrels of crude oil  to NIS between 1991 and 1998.

NIS claimed that it did not have the funds to repay its debts, which it had inherited from the former Milosevic government.   Then, on November 7, 2003, Sinochem and NIS signed a debt relief protocol agreement. Under the terms of this agreement, Sinochem reportedly exempted NIS from $70 million worth of repayment obligations. Then, under the terms of a deal (‘deed of agreement’) that was finalized on October 11, 2004, the parties agreed that remaining repayment obligations of NIS (worth approximately $196 million as of 2004) would be repayable in sixteen, semi-annual installments of approximately $14.2 million over an eight year period (from June 30, 2004 to December 31, 2011).
