The 'Keynote Address at the Official Inauguration of the Office of the Council of Ministers' by Prime Minister Hun Sen further suggests that the office building was donated to the Cambodia Government as Hun Sen conveyed his deep gratitude 'to the people and government of the People’s Republic of China for the valuable grant to build [the] buildings that will be used to improve efficiency and delivery of public services for Cambodian people.AidData only tracks the the first instance of Chinese official financing, so the originally-committed amount has been recorded in the transaction field.","# Sector
