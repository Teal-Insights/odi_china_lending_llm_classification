It is unclear whether these funds have been disbursed.   The purpose of the project is to construct a Satellite Data Receiving Ground Station (SDRGS) at the current location of the Telecom Earth Station right outside of the capital city of Windhoek. The station will include an antenna feed subsystem, channel subsystem, data recording and transmission subsystem and control subsystem. The confirmed project site is situated at 22039’13.54”S, 1703.34’90”E. The satellite dish will be situated on top of the mountain, not far from the Telecom Earth Station buildings. The site for the satellite dish measures approximately 500 m² in extent (20 m x 25 m).   The SDRGS is expected to facilitate the collection remote sensing satellite data for research, decision-making and management purposes on Namibia’s environmental conditions and resources distribution. More specifically, it is expected to provide data for: (a) Disaster risk management; (b) Vegetation and rangeland monitoring; (c) Land cover and land use planning; (d) Agricultural management and monitoring; (e) Water management and monitoring; (f) Fire and drought management and monitoring; (g) Coastline (including border) monitoring; and (h) Phytoplankton and/or Sulphur blooms management; (i) Mineral exploration and marine spatial planning; and (j) Coastal surveillance and monitoring (of illegal fishing and pollution, including monitoring of oil spills).    The project will be implemented through Namibia’s Ministry of Higher Education, Technology & Innovation (MHETI).
