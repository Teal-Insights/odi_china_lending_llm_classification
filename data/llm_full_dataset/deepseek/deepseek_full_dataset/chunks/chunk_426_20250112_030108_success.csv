As part of a larger deal associated with the establishment of diplomatic relations, the Chinese Government promised to take over the funding of the Constituency Development Program (also known as the CDP, the Rural Development Constituency, and Constituency Development Funds), which was previously funded by the Taiwanese Government.

The Constituency Development Fund Act 2013 describes CDFs as ‘funds allocated to constituencies’.

Consequently, CDFs bypass the existing administrative structure (central and provincial governments) for service delivery and utilize the political structure (electoral constituencies) for the disbursement of funds and service delivery outputs. This forces the two delivery mechanisms (administrative and political) to be competitors. According to official Government of the Solomon Islands records, the Chinese Government provided SBD$83,682,010 in general budget support in 2019 to the CDP and SBD$94,026,128 for individual development projects under the CDP in 2019, SBD$103,305,788 in general budget support in 2020 to the CDP and SBD$90,000,000 for individual development projects under the CDP in 2020, and SBD$103,305,788 in general budget support in 2020 to the CDP and SBD$90,000,000 for individual development projects under the CDP in 2021.
