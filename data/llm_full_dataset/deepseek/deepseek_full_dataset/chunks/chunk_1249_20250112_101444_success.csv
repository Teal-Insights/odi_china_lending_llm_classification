26313,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides $176.5 million preferential buyer's credit for Southern Bypass Project,"On December 1, 2011, China Eximbank and the Government of Kenya signed a $183.6 million preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC No. (2011) 32 Total No. (183) No. (1420303052011211528)] for the Southern Bypass Road Project. The face value of the PBC was subsequently revised to $176,538,461.54. The PBC carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 6-year grace period, and a 20-year maturity. The loan is scheduled for semi-annual repayments in equal installments from January 21, 2018, to January 21, 2032. The borrower is expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $216 million commercial (EPC) contract between Kenya National Highways Authority and China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), which was signed on November 17, 2010.   The borrower made principal repayments worth $7,061,538.46 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and $14,123,076.92 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The loan’s amount outstanding was $169,476,923.08 as of June 30, 2020, $155,353,846.15 as of June 30, 2021, and $141,230,769.23 as of June 30, 2022.   The purpose of the Southern Bypass Project was to ease traffic congestion in Nairobi and divert traffic from the city center. The 28.6 km road starts at the junction of the Nairobi–Mombasa Road and Likoni Road, approximately 10 kilometers (6 mi) south-east of the city center. The road then loops through the south-western suburbs of Nairobi, including the northern environs of Nairobi National Park, Uhuru Gardens, Lang'ata, and Dagoretti. In Dagoretti, the road enters Kiambu County and then turns northwards, to pass through Muguga and end in the town of Kikuyu, in a suburb known as Gitaru. At that location, the road connects with the Nairobi-Malaba Road (A104).   Under the supervision of the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA), CRBC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation of the project. The EPC contract went into effect on July 2, 2012. By June 2015, the project had achieved a 81.3% completion rate. However, at that time, CRBC was not in possession of the site for the National Park section due to a lengthy court case by Friends of the Nairobi National Park, which obtained an injunction that stopped KeNHA from constructing the road through the National Park. A court eventually ruled that KeNHA should follow due process and have the section of the National Park that was to be used for road construction appropriately gazetted. Upon gazettement, there were prolonged negotiations around the acquisition of a section of the National Park to facilitate the construction of the project. Negotiations between KeNHA and Kenya Wildlife Service for a grant of easement were subsequently completed and an agreement was signed on September 23, 2015. CRBC was granted possession of the site for the project's National Park section on November 2, 2015. Construction activities were substantially complete as of June 22, 2016 (with a defect liability of 12 months). The project was officially completed on November 1, 2016.  The originally scheduled project completion date (per the EPC contract) was July 31, 2015.   There are indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Southern Bypass Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In March 2022, reports emerged that the Government of Kenya had delayed payments worth more than 3.6 billion Kenyan shillings that were owed to CRBC and landowners displaced by the project, exposing the Government of Kenya to financial penalties and additional interest payments. Kenya’s Auditor General Nancy Gathungu said that the Treasury had fallen behind in remitting 1.2 billion Kenyan shillings to CRBC for the Southern Bypass Project. Gathungu also said that the Treasury had delayed 2.4 billion Kenyan shillings in compensation to landowners displaced by the project corridor. Gathungu warned that taxpayers would be saddled with more financial penalties and additional interest payments if the Kenyan Government did not regularize its payments: '[a]lthough the management has committed to liaise with the line ministry and the National Treasury for adequate budgetary allocation and timely exchequer releases for prompt payments in the subsequent financial year, the project is at risk of incurring additional costs by way of interests and penalties with the continued delay in making the payments.'",1.

The loan was scheduled for repayment in semiannual installments between March, 21, 2018 and March 21, 2031. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance a $30 million (KES 3.3 billion) commercial contract between AVIC International (中航国际) and the Government of Kenya's Ministry of Education (肯尼亚高教部), which was signed in January 2010.   The borrower made principal repayments worth RMB 7,534,387.10 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and RMB 15,068,774.20 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022).

The purpose of the project was to establish 10 vocational and technical institutes — including Coast Institute of Technology, Kabete National Polytechnic, Kenya Coast National Polytechnic, Nyeri National Polytechnic, and the Technical University of Kenya — and provide training to 15,000 students. Training subjects were to cover electrical/electronic engineering, mechanical engineering and rapid prototyping manufacturing. The project also involved the provision of teaching materials and equipment (including diesel generators).   AVIC International was the contractor responsible for project implementation. The originally scheduled implementation start date of the project was July 2, 2012, and the originally scheduled project completion date was June 30, 2017. Project implementation actually commenced in January 2013 and ended in April 2017. The official project handover date was on or around July 19, 2017. As of March 2016, AVIC International had sent 54 teachers and trained 15,000 local students. An ex-post review of the project by Kenya's Auditor General revealed that 1 university and 9 technical training institutes were supplied with electrical/electronic engineering, mechanical engineering, rapid prototyping manufacturing laboratories, and diesel generators (at a cost of $29,281,624 or approximately KES 2,490,159,083), but a physical verification of the equipment in all ten of the vocational and technical institutes revealed that the equipment had not been utilized to full capacity and the generators had not been put to use.  The Auditor General identified a lack of power supply to operationalize the equipment as a key constraint on its use. To address the problem of equipment disuse, AVIC International also launched a skills development initiative called the Africa Tech Challenge. According to Mr. Shikoli Isalambo Benard of the Kenyan Ministry of Education, he told an AVIC International project manager that ‘you’ve given us huge equipment, but the equipment is just here. We’re not utilizing it. So if we have a competition to support this equipment, then really, you’ll be helping us as a country to build the confidence of our students, that they can make things which can actually go out there.’","1.

The loan’s amount outstanding was RMB 165,756,516.10 as of June 30, 2020, RMB 150,687,741.87 as of June 30, 2021, and RMB 135,618,967.64 as of June 30, 2022.   The purpose of the project was to establish 10 vocational and technical institutes — including Coast Institute of Technology, Kabete National Polytechnic, Kenya Coast National Polytechnic, Nyeri National Polytechnic, and the Technical University of Kenya — and provide training to 15,000 students. Training subjects were to cover electrical/electronic engineering, mechanical engineering and rapid prototyping manufacturing. The project also involved the provision of teaching materials and equipment (including diesel generators).   AVIC International was the contractor responsible for project implementation. The originally scheduled implementation start date of the project was July 2, 2012, and the originally scheduled project completion date was June 30, 2017. Project implementation actually commenced in January 2013 and ended in April 2017. The official project handover date was on or around July 19, 2017. As of March 2016, AVIC International had sent 54 teachers and trained 15,000 local students. An ex-post review of the project by Kenya's Auditor General revealed that 1 university and 9 technical training institutes were supplied with electrical/electronic engineering, mechanical engineering, rapid prototyping manufacturing laboratories, and diesel generators (at a cost of $29,281,624 or approximately KES 2,490,159,083), but a physical verification of the equipment in all ten of the vocational and technical institutes revealed that the equipment had not been utilized to full capacity and the generators had not been put to use.  The Auditor General identified a lack of power supply to operationalize the equipment as a key constraint on its use. To address the problem of equipment disuse, AVIC International also launched a skills development initiative called the Africa Tech Challenge. According to Mr. Shikoli Isalambo Benard of the Kenyan Ministry of Education, he told an AVIC International project manager that ‘you’ve given us huge equipment, but the equipment is just here. We’re not utilizing it. So if we have a competition to support this equipment, then really, you’ll be helping us as a country to build the confidence of our students, that they can make things which can actually go out there.’",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,Social Development,Project focuses on education and vocational training without clear environmental or energy transition impacts,"Establishment of 10 vocational and technical institutes, training 15,000 students in various engineering fields, provision of teaching materials and equipment"
