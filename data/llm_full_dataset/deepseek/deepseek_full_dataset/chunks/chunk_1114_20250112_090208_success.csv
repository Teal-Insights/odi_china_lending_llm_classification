53178,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides supplemental RMB 102 million government concessional loan for 90kV Dakar Electricity Distribution Network Rehabilitation and Extension Project (Linked to Project ID#53283 and Project ID#138).,"On November 23, 2012, China Eximbank and Societe Nationale d'Electricite du Senegal (SENELEC) — Senegal’s state-owned electricity company — signed an RMB 102 million government concessional loan (GCL) agreement to provide supplementary funding for the 90kV Dakar Electricity Distribution Network Rehabilitation and Extension Project. This GCL reportedly carries the following terms: 20 year maturity, 7 year grace period, and an interest rate of 1.5%. The purpose of this project was to stabilize supply of electricity for 300,000 households and connect 150,000 additional households to the electricity network. It involved the construction of 474 transformer stations, the laying of 354 km of underground cable, the construction of a low-voltage (30kv) network with the support of geographic information systems, and the installation of 100,000 electricity consumption meters and 17,000 boxes and management systems (100,000 Compteurs prépaiement et 17,000 Coffrets et du Système de gestion) in the suburbs of Dakar.   Prior to the implementation of this project, Senegalese consumers paid their electricity bills every two months based on past electricity usage. However, the system was widely abused and theft was rampant. This project sought to introduce state-of-the-art software to combat electricity theft, which was reportedly resulting in $50 million of lost revenue each year. China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export Corporation (CMEC) was the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction began in 2012 and the project was completed and accepted by the Government of Senegal on April 29, 2016.

The estimated borrowing terms of the PBC are as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 9 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate.  The purpose of the project was to establish a 140MW hydroelectric power plant in Gouina on the Senegal River.  The project involved the construction of a concrete dam with a threshold spilling over its entire width; the construction of a hydroelectric plant with three power generation units capable of producing 620 GWh per year; the construction of a 287 meter long intake canal and a 423 meter long escape canal; the rehabilitation of the existing track and the bridge at the Cimenterie de Diamou; and the construction of a 225-kilovolt high-voltage line connecting the Gouina station to the Medina station not far from Kayes.
