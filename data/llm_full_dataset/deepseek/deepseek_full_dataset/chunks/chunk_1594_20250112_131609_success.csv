Pakistani Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz said that the Chinese Government has agreed to help fund the construction of phase one of the $250 million Gwadar Deep Water Port Project. Then, on August 10, 2001, the Chinese Government and the Government of Pakistan signed a financing framework agreement for development of Phase 1 of the Gwadar Deep Water Port Project. The Chinese Government ultimately signed six different financial agreements for Phase 1.
