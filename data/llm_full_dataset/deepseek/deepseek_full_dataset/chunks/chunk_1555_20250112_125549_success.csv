41428,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides $720 million of debt financing for Phase II of the Ankara-Istanbul High Speed Rail Project,"On July 17, 2007, China Eximbank and the Government of Turkey signed a $500 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement and a $220 million buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement for Phase 2 of Ankara-Istanbul High-Speed Rail Project. This was the first time that China Eximbank ever offered a “mixed credit” that blended a preferential buyer‘s credit and a non-preferential (commercial) buyer’s credit for a single project. The weighted average interest rate of the PBC and the BCL was 2.5%; the weighted average maturity of the PBC and the BCL was 20.3333 years; and the weighted average grace period of the PBC and BCL was 4.3333 years. Sinosure provided buyer’s credit insurance.   The PBC and BCL entered into force on April 7, 2008.

This consortium had previously won an EPC+F bid for the same contract on October 13, 2005.  The “Turkish Portion” of the total project cost ($550 million) was financed by European Investment Bank. Phase 2 involved the construction of a 158 km segment from İnönü to Köseköy along the Ankara-Istanbul high-spreed railway. It was implemented in two sections: a 54km segment from İnönü to Vezirhan and a 104 km segment from Vezirhan to Köseköy.

This project was completed on July 25, 2014. Phases 1 and 3 of the Istanbul to Ankara-Istanbul High-Speed Rail project were undertaken by Spanish and Italian companies.
