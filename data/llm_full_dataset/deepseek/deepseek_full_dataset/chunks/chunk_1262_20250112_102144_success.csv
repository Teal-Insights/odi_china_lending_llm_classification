China Eximbank provides RMB 292 million government concessional loan for Purchasing Dredgers and Supporting Vessels Project (Linked to Project ID#98029, 96221)

# Description
On May 27, 2011, China Eximbank and Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB) signed an RMB 292 million government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Purchasing Dredgers and Supporting Vessels Project. The borrowing terms of the GCL are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was to use the GCL proceeds to finance a $40 million commercial contract that China National Aero-Technology Import & Export Corporation (CATIC) and Myanmar’s Ministry of Transportation signed on December 13, 2010.   The purpose of the project was to facilitate the acquisition of 19 dredgers and auxiliary vessels by the Ministry of Transportation of Myanmar. CATIC began building the watercraft – including five cutter suction dredgers, two backhoe dredgers, four split hopper barges, a tug boat, a landing craft and six aid vessels – in December 2011. It completed the construction of the watercraft in June 2013. One batch of the dredgers and vessels arrived in Yangon on July 20, 2013 and another arrived in August 2013. A project completion ceremony took place on September 14, 2013.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Purchasing Dredgers and Supporting Vessels Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Myanmar signed a debt suspension agreement as part of the G-20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between May 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under 3 buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreements, 6 government concessional loan (GCL) agreements, and 27 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreements (as captured via Project ID#98029).  Debt service payments under many of these loan agreements were again deferred in 2021 (as captured via Project ID#96221).",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,General Infrastructure,Project focuses on acquiring dredgers and vessels for transportation purposes without clear environmental or energy transition impacts,"Purchase of 19 dredgers and auxiliary vessels for Myanmar's Ministry of Transportation, including cutter suction dredgers, backhoe dredgers, barges, tug boat, landing craft, and aid vessels"

The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $33 million commercial contract between China National Construction & Agricultural Machinery Import & Export Corporation (CAMC) and Tyre Rubber Industry Corporation of the Second Ministry of Industry of Myanmar, which was signed on September 25, 2007.  The purpose of the project was to construct a tire factory in the town of Bilin within Mon State with an annual capacity of 300,000 radial tires. The scope of the project included factory design, equipment supply, installation and commissioning, and personnel training.   CAMC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation.
