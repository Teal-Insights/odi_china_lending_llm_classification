JSC KazTransGas (KTG) and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (acting through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) each hold a 50% ownership stake in BSGP. The Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline is a 1,454 km long gas pipeline that runs through the Mangistau, Aktyubinsk, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions. It has a pipe diameter of 1067 mm. The purpose of the project was to ensure stable gas demand in the southern Kazakhstan, reduce dependence on imported gas and ensure the energy security of Kazakhstan. Construction of the pipeline was split into two phases. The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved the construction of 1,143.2 km of pipeline from the Bozoi gas metering station in the Shalkar region of Aktobe Region to Akbulak gas metering station in Sairam of South Kazakhstan Region (now known as the Turkistan Region). It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-1 and Bozoy shift camp in Shalkar region of Aktobe Region, emergency-response centers in Saksaulsk, Aksuat and Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region and an emergency-response center in Shornak within the South Kazakhstan Region, as well as construction of the automated process control system (SCADA) and telecommunication (fiber-optic communication line) for the gas pipeline in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions.   The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project commenced on July 17, 2012. The project was originally expected to be completed by the end of 2012. It was ultimately completed on September 7, 2013, resulting in a throughput capacity of up to 10 bcm per year. The second phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved 306.3 km of gas pipeline construction from Beineu settlement in the Mangystau Region to Bozoi settlement in the Aktobe Region. It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-4 Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region, Beineu gas metering station in Mangystau Region, the SCADA central dispatch control in Kyzylorda, and gas pipeline construction in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions. It was completed on December 30, 2016. Between 2014 and 2017, over 9.0 bcm of gas was transported via the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent gas pipeline, providing the southern regions with Kazakhstani gas. Then, in November 2017, a head compressor station at Bozoi and a line compressor station at Karaozek were put into operation, increasing the capacity of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to 10 bcm per year. In October 2017, Kazakhstan began exporting gas to China pursuant to a contract concluded between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina for the supply of bcm from October 15, 2017 until October 14, 2018. The price of the gas exported to China pursuant to this agreement was linked to the price of Brent crude oil and determined quarterly. As of December 31, 2017, negotiations were ongoing with respect to a long-term gas supply agreement between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina. BSGP and KazMunayGas expected that the export of gas to China would increase in the future and made plans to construct three new compressor stations on the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline between 2018 and 2019 to handle increased throughput.   In order to fund Phase I of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $1.8 billion USD syndicated loan with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BoC) on December 11, 2012 (captured via Project ID#39562). This loan bore interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 2.7% margin per annum for the duration of the guarantee period (until December 31, 2019) and, thereafter, at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 3.2% margin per annum. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in December 2017 until March 11, 2028 (implying a grace period of 5 years and a maturity period of 15.25 years). The loan was secured by corporate guarantees from KazMunayGas and CNPC. In February 2016 and September 2017, amendments were signed because of BSGP's non-compliance with certain project milestones provided for in the facility (loan) agreement; the milestones were extended until September 30, 2019. These amendments required BSGP's prepayment of $400 million of the outstanding indebtedness, which KazMunayGas provided to BSGP for repayment. The loan was secured by additional security, including an offshore account charge, an onshore account pledge and security assignment of BSGP's rights under the shareholder support agreement in favor of the security agent. As of June 30, 2017, the loan’s outstanding amount was $1.462 billion USD. As of December 31, 2017, the loan’s outstanding amount was was $1.0 billion USD.   Then, on September 17, 2015, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $700 million USD syndicated loan agreement with CDB and BOC for Phase II of the project to supplement their $1.8 billion USD loan for Phase I. CDB and BoC each contributed $350 million USD to the loan for Phase II. Project ID#73384 captures the BoC contribution. Project ID#40362 captures the CDB contribution. The $700 million loan for Phase II carried a maturity of 15 years (final maturity date: September 17, 2030). Its interest rate is unknown. Then, on August 14, 2019, Beinenu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $720 million syndicated facility (loan) agreement with Bank of China and MUFG Bank, Ltd. (captured via Project #91744). The proceeds of the syndicated loan were to be used by the borrower to refinance the $1.8 billion CDB/BoC loan that it contracted on December 11, 2012. The interest rate of the August 2019 syndicated loan (3-month LIBOR plus a 1.65% margin) was lower than the interest rate of the December 2012 loan. The maturity length of the August 2019 syndicated loan (5.33 years; final maturity date: December 20, 2024) was also shorter than the maturity length of the December 2012 loan. As as result of this debt refinancing arrangement, Beinenu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP reduced its repayment obligations for Phase I by $10.5 million.","1.

Then, in February 2008, JSC KazTransGas and Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited — a wholly owned subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) — created a special purpose vehicle called Asia Gas Pipeline LLP (AGP) to construct, finance, and operate the Kazakh Section of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline Project. KazTransGas and CNPC each hold a 50% equity stake in AGP.   On October 22, 2008, AGP entered into a $7.5 billion syndicated facility (loan) agreement with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) for the Kazakh Section of Lines A and B of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline Project (captured via Projects ID#54489, #91923). The loan facility bore interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 2.15% margin per annum during the CNPC loan repayment guarantee period and 3-month LIBOR plus a 2.9% margin per annum thereafter. The loan is to be repaid in several installments beginning in March 2013 until December 23, 2023. Therefore, the loan’s implied grace period is 4.5 years and its implied maturity length is 15 years. CNPC issued a loan repayment guarantee that was effective until March 28, 2020 on the condition that borrower would subsequently sign 'ship & pay' agreements with the CNPC group of companies by September 28, 2019. After the expiry of the CNPC repayment guarantee, the loan's margin increased from 2.15% to 2.9%. The amounts due under this loan were secured by (collateralized against) account charges, a pledge over deposit certificate agreement, an insurance assignment, and the repayment guarantee from CNPC. As of December 31, 2017, the loan’s amount outstanding was $4,029,784,000. As of December 31, 2018, the loan’s amount outstanding was $2,700,836,000. The proceeds of the loan were used by the borrower to finance EPC contracts (for pipelines and compressors) with China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Corporation (CPECC), and KazStroyService (KSS).   The purpose of the project was to construct the Kazakh sections of Line A and Line B of the 1873 km Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline. These sections both measure 1300 km in length and they run parallel to each other in Southern Kazakhstan from Shymkent to the Alataw Pass. The pipeline then crosses the Kazakhstan-China border at Horgos (Xinjiang Province), where it connects to the West-East Gas Pipeline 2. The project also involved the construction of compressor stations along the Kazakh Section of Lines A and B.   China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Corporation (CPECC), and KazStroyService (KSS) were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. A formal commencement ceremony took place on July 9, 2008. However, construction of the Kazakh section of the pipeline did not commence until August 1, 2008. Line A achieved 'state acceptance' on December 4, 2009. Then, on December 12, 2009, the Kazakh section of Line A was officially inaugurated. Line B achieved 'state acceptance' on October 18, 2010. On February 3, 2011, AGP obtained a general license for the operation of Line A and Line B. By October 20, 2012, all compressor stations along Line A and Line B of the Central Asia–China Gas Pipeline were operational, enabling the pipeline to transmit 30 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually. All of the compressor stations along Line A and Line B achieved ‘state acceptance’ between June 2012 and December 2012.   Then, on December 27, 2012, AGP entered into a $4.7 billion syndicated facility (loan) agreement with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) for the Kazakh Section of Line C of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline Project (captured via Projects ID#39997 and #91926). The loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 2.35% margin per annum during the CNPC loan repayment guarantee period and 3-month LIBOR + a 3.45% per annum thereafter. The loan is to be repaid in several installments beginning in June 2017 until December 27, 2027. Therefore, the loan’s implied grace period is 4.5 years and its implied maturity length is 15 years. CNPC issued a loan repayment guarantee that was effective until March 28, 2020 on the condition that borrower would subsequently sign 'ship & pay' agreements with the CNPC group of companies by September 28, 2019. After the expiry of the CNPC repayment guarantee, the loan's margin increased from 2.35% to 3.45%. The loan was secured by (collateralized against) a ‘ship or pay’ transportation agreement pledge, account charges, insurance and reinsurance policies assignments, and the repayment guarantee from CNPC. As of December 31, 2017, the loan’s amount outstanding was $2,923,178,000. As of December 31, 2018, the loan’s amount outstanding was $2,511,324,000.   The purpose of the project was to construct the Kazakh section of Line C of the 1873 km Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline. This section measures 1300 km in length and runs parallel to Lines A and B in Southern Kazakhstan from Shymkent to the Alataw Pass. The pipeline then crosses the Kazakhstan-China border at Horgos (Xinjiang Province), where it connects to the West-East Gas Pipeline 2. The project also involved the construction of compressor stations along the Kazakh Section of Line C. Line C has a designed capacity of 25 billion cubic meters per annum, and its pipe diameter is 1,219 mm, 152 mm larger than Line A/B. Upon completion of all supporting facilities of Line C, the overall delivery capacity of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline was expected to reach 55 billion cubic meters per annum, equaling approximately 20% of China’s annual natural gas consumption while annually substituting 73 million tons of coal and cutting carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions by 78 million tons and 1.21 million tons, respectively.   China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Corporation (CPECC), and KazStroyService (KSS) were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. It was originally envisaged that the construction of Line C would take place between January 2012 and January 2014. However, the construction of Line C did not begin until January 16, 2013. The overall welding work of the pipeline was completed at the end of 2013. Line C went into operation on May 31, 2014. Line C was officially commissioned on June 9, 2015. Its compressor stations achieved ‘state acceptance’ between July 2015 and October 2018. Line C successfully transmitted gas to Khorgas on June 15, 2017. Line C’s Supervisory Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) — a software communication system that allows for various gas production sites to communicate with each other — achieved ‘state acceptance’ in November 2018.”   In December 2012, AGP entered into a $4.7 billion USD syndicated loan facility with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) to finance the construction of Line C of the Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline. The loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 2.35% margin per annum during the guarantee period and 3-month LIBOR + a 3.45% per annum thereafter. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in June 2017 until December 27, 2027. The loan was secured by a ""ship or pay"" transportation agreement pledge, account charges, insurance and reinsurance policies assignments, and a guarantee from CNPC. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount from this loan was $2.9 billion USD. Based on this information, the interest rate was recorded as 3-Month LIBOR in December 2012 (0.309%) + 2.35%, or 2.659%, while the grace period was 4.5 years, the repayment period was 10.5 years, and the maturity period was 15 years.","1.

AidData calculated the transaction amount ($2.35 billion) assuming that all participants (2) in the $4.7 billion syndicated loan contributed equal amounts. See #91926 for BOC portion. 3. AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate by adding 2.35% to average 3-month LIBOR in December 2012 (0.309%).   4. Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan reportedly each contribute 10 bcm of gas to Line C, while Kazakhstan supplies 5 bcm of gas.   5. The Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline—also known as the Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline or the Asia Gas Pipeline—is a 1,873-kilometer long gas pipeline connecting Turkmenistan to China via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, which delivers gas equal to approximately 20% of China’s annual natural gas consumption. It consists of 4 lines (A, B, C, and D). Lines A, B, and C run parallel to each other. These three pipelines begin at Gedaim on the Turkmen-Uzbek border, run through central Uzbekistan and southern Kazakhstan, and end at Khorgas in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Roughly 188 kilometers of Lines A-C are in Turkmenistan, roughly 529 (or 530) kilometers of Lines A-C are in Kazakhstan, and roughly 1115 (or 1300) kilometers of of Lines A-C run from Kazakhstan to China. Line D, which is still under construction, will be 966 kilometers in length and connect Galkynysh to western China via Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. It will originate at the Galkynysh gas field in Turkmenistan. Then, in Tajikistan, Line D will run through Tursunzoda, Shahrinav, Hisor, Roudaki, Vahdat, Fayzobod, Nourobod, Rasht and Lakhsh (formerly Jirgatol) to Kyrgyzstan’s border. It will then go through Kyrgyzstan, crossing into China near the village of Irkeshtam on the Kyrgyzstan-China border. The Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline is supplied from the Galkynysh and Dauletabad gas fields, as well as from the Bagtyyarlyk gas field in Turkmenistan, where it originates. The pipeline is also supplied with gas from the Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to which it is linked in Shymkent, Kazakhstan. The Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent Gas Pipeline delivers gas originating in gas fields of Kazakhstan. Line A and Line B connect to the Second West-East Gas Pipeline, while Line C connects to the Third West-East Gas Pipeline. Line D, which is under construction, will connect to the Fifth West-East Gas Pipeline. Line A, B, and C provide 55 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas to China per annum. Line D is planned to have capacity of 30 bcm/year. 6. The construction of the China-Central Asia Gas Pipeline was financed through a series of Chinese loans and equity investments: $7.5 billion syndicated CDB/BoC loan for Kazakh Section of Lines A and B (captured via Projects ID#54489, #91923); $4.7 billion syndicated CDB/BoC loan for the Kazakh Section of Line C (captured via Projects ID#39997, #91926); $3.5 billion syndicated CDB/BoC loan for the Uzbek Sections of Lines A and B (captured via Projects ID#91901, #91917); $1.4 billion syndicated CDB/BoC loan for the Uzbek Section of Line C (captured via Projects ID#54528 #91898); $300 million CNPC Finance loan for Tajik Section of Line D (captured via Project ID#39955); and $300 million equity investment from Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited for Line D of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline Project (captured via Project ID#70616).","# Sector

# Description
In August 2007, the Government of Kazakhstan and the Chinese Government signed a 33-year intergovernmental agreement to develop two gas pipeline projects—the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline and the Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline—as 50:50 joint ventures. Then, in February 2008, JSC KazTransGas and Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited — a wholly owned subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) — created a special purpose vehicle called Asia Gas Pipeline LLP (AGP) to construct, finance, and operate the Kazakh Section of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline Project. KazTransGas and CNPC each hold a 50% equity stake in AGP.   On October 22, 2008, AGP entered into a $7.5 billion syndicated facility (loan) agreement with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) for the Kazakh Section of Lines A and B of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline Project (captured via Projects ID#54489, #91923). The loan facility bore interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 2.15% margin per annum during the CNPC loan repayment guarantee period and 3-month LIBOR plus a 2.9% margin per annum thereafter. The loan is to be repaid in several installments beginning in March 2013 until December 23, 2023. Therefore, the loan’s implied grace period is 4.5 years and its implied maturity length is 15 years. CNPC issued a loan repayment guarantee that was effective until March 28, 2020 on the condition that borrower would subsequently sign 'ship & pay' agreements with the CNPC group of companies by September 28, 2019. After the expiry of the CNPC repayment guarantee, the loan's margin increased from 2.15% to 2.9%. The amounts due under this loan were secured by (collateralized against) account charges, a pledge over deposit certificate agreement, an insurance assignment, and the repayment guarantee from CNPC. As of December 31, 2017, the loan’s amount outstanding was $4,029,784,000. As of December 31, 2018, the loan’s amount outstanding was $2,700,836,000.

A formal commencement ceremony took place on July 9, 2008. However, construction of the Kazakh section of the pipeline did not commence until August 1, 2008. Line A achieved 'state acceptance' on December 4, 2009. Then, on December 12, 2009, the Kazakh section of Line A was officially inaugurated. Line B achieved 'state acceptance' on October 18, 2010. On February 3, 2011, AGP obtained a general license for the operation of Line A and Line B. By October 20, 2012, all compressor stations along Line A and Line B of the Central Asia–China Gas Pipeline were operational, enabling the pipeline to transmit 30 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually. All of the compressor stations along Line A and Line B achieved ‘state acceptance’ between June 2012 and December 2012.   Then, on December 27, 2012, AGP entered into a $4.7 billion syndicated facility (loan) agreement with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) for the Kazakh Section of Line C of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline Project (captured via Projects ID#39997 and #91926). The loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 2.35% margin per annum during the CNPC loan repayment guarantee period and 3-month LIBOR + a 3.45% per annum thereafter. The loan is to be repaid in several installments beginning in June 2017 until December 27, 2027. Therefore, the loan’s implied grace period is 4.5 years and its implied maturity length is 15 years. CNPC issued a loan repayment guarantee that was effective until March 28, 2020 on the condition that borrower would subsequently sign 'ship & pay' agreements with the CNPC group of companies by September 28, 2019. After the expiry of the CNPC repayment guarantee, the loan's margin increased from 2.35% to 3.45%. The loan was secured by (collateralized against) a ‘ship or pay’ transportation agreement pledge, account charges, insurance and reinsurance policies assignments, and the repayment guarantee from CNPC. As of December 31, 2017, the loan’s amount outstanding was $2,923,178,000. As of December 31, 2018, the loan’s amount outstanding was $2,511,324,000.   The purpose of the project was to construct the Kazakh section of Line C of the 1873 km Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline. This section measures 1300 km in length and runs parallel to Lines A and B in Southern Kazakhstan from Shymkent to the Alataw Pass. The pipeline then crosses the Kazakhstan-China border at Horgos (Xinjiang Province), where it connects to the West-East Gas Pipeline 2. The project also involved the construction of compressor stations along the Kazakh Section of Line C. Line C has a designed capacity of 25 billion cubic meters per annum, and its pipe diameter is 1,219 mm, 152 mm larger than Line A/B. Upon completion of all supporting facilities of Line C, the overall delivery capacity of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline was expected to reach 55 billion cubic meters per annum, equaling approximately 20% of China’s annual natural gas consumption while annually substituting 73 million tons of coal and cutting carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions by 78 million tons and 1.21 million tons, respectively.   China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Corporation (CPECC), and KazStroyService (KSS) were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. It was originally envisaged that the construction of Line C would take place between January 2012 and January 2014. However, the construction of Line C did not begin until January 16, 2013. The overall welding work of the pipeline was completed at the end of 2013. Line C went into operation on May 31, 2014. Line C was officially commissioned on June 9, 2015. Its compressor stations achieved ‘state acceptance’ between July 2015 and October 2018. Line C successfully transmitted gas to Khorgas on June 15, 2017. Line C’s Supervisory Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) — a software communication system that allows for various gas production sites to communicate with each other — achieved ‘state acceptance’ in November 2018.”   In December 2012, AGP entered into a $4.7 billion USD syndicated loan facility with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) to finance the construction of Line C of the Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline. The loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 2.35% margin per annum during the guarantee period and 3-month LIBOR + a 3.45% per annum thereafter. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in June 2017 until December 27, 2027. The loan was secured by a ""ship or pay"" transportation agreement pledge, account charges, insurance and reinsurance policies assignments, and a guarantee from CNPC. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount from this loan was $2.9 billion USD. Based on this information, the interest rate was recorded as 3-Month LIBOR in December 2012 (0.309%) + 2.35%, or 2.659%, while the grace period was 4.5 years, the repayment period was 10.5 years, and the maturity period was 15 years.",TRUE,NA,BROWN,HIGH,Oil and Gas Infrastructure,"The project involves the construction of a natural gas pipeline, which is primarily focused on fossil fuel infrastructure and increases dependency on natural gas, hindering the energy transition.","Construction of the Kazakh section of Line C of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline, designed to transmit 25 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually, connecting to the West-East Gas Pipeline 2 in China."

The loan facility bore interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 2.15% margin per annum during the CNPC loan repayment guarantee period and 3-month LIBOR plus a 2.9% margin per annum thereafter. The loan is to be repaid in several installments beginning in March 2013 until December 23, 2023. Therefore, the loan’s implied grace period is 4.5 years and its implied maturity length is 15 years. CNPC issued a loan repayment guarantee that was effective until March 28, 2020 on the condition that borrower would subsequently sign 'ship & pay' agreements with the CNPC group of companies by September 28, 2019. After the expiry of the CNPC repayment guarantee, the loan's margin increased from 2.15% to 2.9%. The amounts due under this loan were secured by (collateralized against) account charges, a pledge over deposit certificate agreement, an insurance assignment, and the repayment guarantee from CNPC. As of December 31, 2017, the loan’s amount outstanding was $4,029,784,000. As of December 31, 2018, the loan’s amount outstanding was $2,700,836,000. The proceeds of the loan were used by the borrower to finance EPC contracts (for pipelines and compressors) with China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Corporation (CPECC), and KazStroyService (KSS).   The purpose of the project was to construct the Kazakh sections of Line A and Line B of the 1873 km Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline. These sections both measure 1300 km in length and they run parallel to each other in Southern Kazakhstan from Shymkent to the Alataw Pass. The pipeline then crosses the Kazakhstan-China border at Horgos (Xinjiang Province), where it connects to the West-East Gas Pipeline 2. The project also involved the construction of compressor stations along the Kazakh Section of Lines A and B.   China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Corporation (CPECC), and KazStroyService (KSS) were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. A formal commencement ceremony took place on July 9, 2008. However, construction of the Kazakh section of the pipeline did not commence until August 1, 2008. Line A achieved 'state acceptance' on December 4, 2009. Then, on December 12, 2009, the Kazakh section of Line A was officially inaugurated. Line B achieved 'state acceptance' on October 18, 2010. On February 3, 2011, AGP obtained a general license for the operation of Line A and Line B. By October 20, 2012, all compressor stations along Line A and Line B of the Central Asia–China Gas Pipeline were operational, enabling the pipeline to transmit 30 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually. All of the compressor stations along Line A and Line B achieved ‘state acceptance’ between June 2012 and December 2012.   Then, on December 27, 2012, AGP entered into a $4.7 billion syndicated facility (loan) agreement with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) for the Kazakh Section of Line C of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline Project (captured via Projects ID#39997 and #91926). The loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 2.35% margin per annum during the CNPC loan repayment guarantee period and 3-month LIBOR + a 3.45% per annum thereafter. The loan is to be repaid in several installments beginning in June 2017 until December 27, 2027. Therefore, the loan’s implied grace period is 4.5 years and its implied maturity length is 15 years. CNPC issued a loan repayment guarantee that was effective until March 28, 2020 on the condition that borrower would subsequently sign 'ship & pay' agreements with the CNPC group of companies by September 28, 2019. After the expiry of the CNPC repayment guarantee, the loan's margin increased from 2.35% to 3.45%. The loan was secured by (collateralized against) a ‘ship or pay’ transportation agreement pledge, account charges, insurance and reinsurance policies assignments, and the repayment guarantee from CNPC. As of December 31, 2017, the loan’s amount outstanding was $2,923,178,000. As of December 31, 2018, the loan’s amount outstanding was $2,511,324,000.   The purpose of the project was to construct the Kazakh section of Line C of the 1873 km Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline. This section measures 1300 km in length and runs parallel to Lines A and B in Southern Kazakhstan from Shymkent to the Alataw Pass. The pipeline then crosses the Kazakhstan-China border at Horgos (Xinjiang Province), where it connects to the West-East Gas Pipeline 2. The project also involved the construction of compressor stations along the Kazakh Section of Line C. Line C has a designed capacity of 25 billion cubic meters per annum, and its pipe diameter is 1,219 mm, 152 mm larger than Line A/B. Upon completion of all supporting facilities of Line C, the overall delivery capacity of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline was expected to reach 55 billion cubic meters per annum, equaling approximately 20% of China’s annual natural gas consumption while annually substituting 73 million tons of coal and cutting carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions by 78 million tons and 1.21 million tons, respectively.   China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Corporation (CPECC), and KazStroyService (KSS) were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. It was originally envisaged that the construction of Line C would take place between January 2012 and January 2014. However, the construction of Line C did not begin until January 16, 2013. The overall welding work of the pipeline was completed at the end of 2013. Line C went into operation on May 31, 2014. Line C was officially commissioned on June 9, 2015. Its compressor stations achieved ‘state acceptance’ between July 2015 and October 2018. Line C successfully transmitted gas to Khorgas on June 15, 2017. Line C’s Supervisory Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) — a software communication system that allows for various gas production sites to communicate with each other — achieved ‘state acceptance’ in November 2018.”   In December 2012, AGP entered into a $4.7 billion USD syndicated loan facility with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) to finance the construction of Line C of the Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline. The loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 2.35% margin per annum during the guarantee period and 3-month LIBOR + a 3.45% per annum thereafter. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in June 2017 until December 27, 2027. The loan was secured by a ""ship or pay"" transportation agreement pledge, account charges, insurance and reinsurance policies assignments, and a guarantee from CNPC. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount from this loan was $2.9 billion USD. Based on this information, the interest rate was recorded as 3-Month LIBOR in December 2012 (0.309%) + 2.35%, or 2.659%, while the grace period was 4.5 years, the repayment period was 10.5 years, and the maturity period was 15 years.","1.

Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan reportedly each contribute 10 bcm of gas to Line C, while Kazakhstan supplies 5 bcm of gas.   5. The Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline—also known as the Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline or the Asia Gas Pipeline—is a 1,873-kilometer long gas pipeline connecting Turkmenistan to China via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, which delivers gas equal to approximately 20% of China’s annual natural gas consumption. It consists of 4 lines (A, B, C, and D). Lines A, B, and C run parallel to each other. These three pipelines begin at Gedaim on the Turkmen-Uzbek border, run through central Uzbekistan and southern Kazakhstan, and end at Khorgas in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Roughly 188 kilometers of Lines A-C are in Turkmenistan, roughly 529 (or 530) kilometers of Lines A-C are in Kazakhstan, and roughly 1115 (or 1300) kilometers of of Lines A-C run from Kazakhstan to China. Line D, which is still under construction, will be 966 kilometers in length and connect Galkynysh to western China via Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. It will originate at the Galkynysh gas field in Turkmenistan. Then, in Tajikistan, Line D will run through Tursunzoda, Shahrinav, Hisor, Roudaki, Vahdat, Fayzobod, Nourobod, Rasht and Lakhsh (formerly Jirgatol) to Kyrgyzstan’s border. It will then go through Kyrgyzstan, crossing into China near the village of Irkeshtam on the Kyrgyzstan-China border. The Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline is supplied from the Galkynysh and Dauletabad gas fields, as well as from the Bagtyyarlyk gas field in Turkmenistan, where it originates. The pipeline is also supplied with gas from the Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to which it is linked in Shymkent, Kazakhstan. The Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent Gas Pipeline delivers gas originating in gas fields of Kazakhstan. Line A and Line B connect to the Second West-East Gas Pipeline, while Line C connects to the Third West-East Gas Pipeline. Line D, which is under construction, will connect to the Fifth West-East Gas Pipeline. Line A, B, and C provide 55 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas to China per annum. Line D is planned to have capacity of 30 bcm/year. 6. The construction of the China-Central Asia Gas Pipeline was financed through a series of Chinese loans and equity investments: $7.5 billion syndicated CDB/BoC loan for Kazakh Section of Lines A and B (captured via Projects ID#54489, #91923); $4.7 billion syndicated CDB/BoC loan for the Kazakh Section of Line C (captured via Projects ID#39997, #91926); $3.5 billion syndicated CDB/BoC loan for the Uzbek Sections of Lines A and B (captured via Projects ID#91901, #91917); $1.4 billion syndicated CDB/BoC loan for the Uzbek Section of Line C (captured via Projects ID#54528 #91898); $300 million CNPC Finance loan for Tajik Section of Line D (captured via Project ID#39955); and $300 million equity investment from Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited for Line D of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline Project (captured via Project ID#70616).","# Sector

# Description
In August 2007, the Government of Kazakhstan and the Chinese Government signed a 33-year intergovernmental agreement to develop two gas pipeline projects—the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline and the Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline—as 50:50 joint ventures. Then, in February 2008, JSC KazTransGas and Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited — a wholly owned subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) — created a special purpose vehicle called Asia Gas Pipeline LLP (AGP) to construct, finance, and operate the Kazakh Section of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline Project. KazTransGas and CNPC each hold a 50% equity stake in AGP.   On October 22, 2008, AGP entered into a $7.5 billion syndicated facility (loan) agreement with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) for the Kazakh Section of Lines A and B of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline Project (captured via Projects ID#54489, #91923). The loan facility bore interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 2.15% margin per annum during the CNPC loan repayment guarantee period and 3-month LIBOR plus a 2.9% margin per annum thereafter. The loan is to be repaid in several installments beginning in March 2013 until December 23, 2023. Therefore, the loan’s implied grace period is 4.5 years and its implied maturity length is 15 years. CNPC issued a loan repayment guarantee that was effective until March 28, 2020 on the condition that borrower would subsequently sign 'ship & pay' agreements with the CNPC group of companies by September 28, 2019. After the expiry of the CNPC repayment guarantee, the loan's margin increased from 2.15% to 2.9%. The amounts due under this loan were secured by (collateralized against) account charges, a pledge over deposit certificate agreement, an insurance assignment, and the repayment guarantee from CNPC. As of December 31, 2017, the loan’s amount outstanding was $4,029,784,000. As of December 31, 2018, the loan’s amount outstanding was $2,700,836,000.

95748,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",CDB provides $200 million loan for Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project,"In June 2009, China Development Bank (CDB) agreed to provide a $3 billion line of credit to JSC Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna (also known as ‘Samruk-Kazyna’). Borrowings through the line of credit were to be used for the development of infrastructure and resource projects in Kazakhstan. Then, on October 13, 2009, KAZ Minerals PLC (also known as ‘Kazakhmys Corporation LLC’ and ‘Kazakhmys’) announced that it was in discussions with CDB and Samruk-Kazyna regarding a major unsecured loan facility. Following a memorandum of financial cooperation that was signed by Kazakhmys, Samruk-Kazyna and CDB on November 14, 2009, $2.7 billion from the $3 billion line of credit was allocated to various projects of KAZ Minerals PLC. Then, on December 30, 2009, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC (also known as Kazakhmys Finance PLC) — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals PLC — and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $2 billion facility (loan) agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project. On the same day, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $100 million facility (loan) agreement for the Bozymchak Copper and Gold Mine Development Project. Thirteen days later, on January 12, 2010, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project. Then, on June 11, 2012, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed two additional loan agreements: a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All five loan agreements (collectively worth $2.7 billion) were financed by Samruk-Kazyna via borrowings from the $3 billion CDB line of credit.  All of the loans carried the following borrowing terms: maturities of between 12 and 15 years (with final maturity dates falling between January 2022 and August 2025), 3 year grace periods (with the first loan repayment scheduled for January 2013), annual interest rates of LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin, and 1.5% management fees. A separate fee of $3 million was also payable under the loan agreements for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Project and the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All of the loans were also backed by repayment guarantees from KAZ Minerals PLC and a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna. All five loans reportedly disbursed in full by January 2013. The remaining $300 million under the $3 billion CDB line of credit was utilized (drawn down) by Samruk-Kazyna for an unknown purposes and fully repaid in January 2013. In January 2014, KAZ Minerals PLC fully repaid its loans for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project (since the development of these projects was no longer expected to commence in the near future). Then, on December 29, 2014, two of the loan agreements that KAZ Minerals Finance PLC had previously signed with Samruk-Kazyna (via on-lending from the CDB line of credit) were transformed into bilateral loan agreements with CDB: the loan agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project and the loan agreement for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project. At that time, the face value of the loan for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project was $1,844,000,000 (most likely because some repayments were made between January 2013 and December 2014) and the face value of the loan for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project was upsized to $148,500,000 (for an unknown reason). At that time the borrowing, terms of the two loans with outstanding balances were rescheduled.  The interest rate was lowered from LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin to LIBOR plus a 4.50% margin; and an arrangement fee of 0.5% was agreed upon, of which 60% was paid in December 2014 and 40% was paid in January 2016. The maturities and grace periods of the loan were left unchanged. KAZ Minerals PLC continued to serve as a guarantor for the loans. However, as an additional credit enhancement, the borrower pledged a $100,000,000 minimum cash balance in a charge account (collection account) as a source of collateral. The amended, bilateral loan (facility) agreements between CDB and KAZ Minerals also clarified that the loan proceeds were to be used by the borrower ‘principally for the development of the Bozshakol and Bozymchak [mine] projects.’ As of December 31, 2020, $1.0 billion was drawn down by the borrower under the $1,844,000,000 CDB loan agreement and the $148,500,000 CDB loan agreement. During 2020, the borrower made a $183 million repayment. An additional $181 million repayment was due in 2021. Both CDB loans are repayable in semi-annual installments each January and July with final maturity dates in August 2025.

Following a memorandum of financial cooperation that was signed by Kazakhmys, Samruk-Kazyna and CDB on November 14, 2009, $2.7 billion from the $3 billion line of credit was allocated to various projects of KAZ Minerals PLC. Then, on December 30, 2009, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC (also known as Kazakhmys Finance PLC) — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals PLC — and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $2 billion facility (loan) agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project. On the same day, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $100 million facility (loan) agreement for the Bozymchak Copper and Gold Mine Development Project. Thirteen days later, on January 12, 2010, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project. Then, on June 11, 2012, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed two additional loan agreements: a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All five loan agreements (collectively worth $2.7 billion) were financed by Samruk-Kazyna via borrowings from the $3 billion CDB line of credit.  All of the loans carried the following borrowing terms: maturities of between 12 and 15 years (with final maturity dates falling between January 2022 and August 2025), 3 year grace periods (with the first loan repayment scheduled for January 2013), annual interest rates of LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin, and 1.5% management fees. A separate fee of $3 million was also payable under the loan agreements for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Project and the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All of the loans were also backed by repayment guarantees from KAZ Minerals PLC and a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna. All five loans reportedly disbursed in full by January 2013. The remaining $300 million under the $3 billion CDB line of credit was utilized (drawn down) by Samruk-Kazyna for an unknown purposes and fully repaid in January 2013. In January 2014, KAZ Minerals PLC fully repaid its loans for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project (since the development of these projects was no longer expected to commence in the near future). Then, on December 29, 2014, two of the loan agreements that KAZ Minerals Finance PLC had previously signed with Samruk-Kazyna (via on-lending from the CDB line of credit) were transformed into bilateral loan agreements with CDB: the loan agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project and the loan agreement for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project. At that time, the face value of the loan for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project was $1,844,000,000 (most likely because some repayments were made between January 2013 and December 2014) and the face value of the loan for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project was upsized to $148,500,000 (for an unknown reason). At that time the borrowing, terms of the two loans with outstanding balances were rescheduled.  The interest rate was lowered from LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin to LIBOR plus a 4.50% margin; and an arrangement fee of 0.5% was agreed upon, of which 60% was paid in December 2014 and 40% was paid in January 2016. The maturities and grace periods of the loan were left unchanged. KAZ Minerals PLC continued to serve as a guarantor for the loans. However, as an additional credit enhancement, the borrower pledged a $100,000,000 minimum cash balance in a charge account (collection account) as a source of collateral. The amended, bilateral loan (facility) agreements between CDB and KAZ Minerals also clarified that the loan proceeds were to be used by the borrower ‘principally for the development of the Bozshakol and Bozymchak [mine] projects.’ As of December 31, 2020, $1.0 billion was drawn down by the borrower under the $1,844,000,000 CDB loan agreement and the $148,500,000 CDB loan agreement. During 2020, the borrower made a $183 million repayment. An additional $181 million repayment was due in 2021. Both CDB loans are repayable in semi-annual installments each January and July with final maturity dates in August 2025.
