63462,COMMUNICATIONS,China Eximbank provides $98.6 million preferential buyer’s credit for Phase 2 of TelOne Broadband Expansion Project,"On December 1, 2015, China Eximbank and the Government of Zimbabwe signed a $98,617,482 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for Phase 2 of the TelOne Broadband Expansion Project. Then, on April 5, 2016, Zimbabwe’s Parliament ratified the PBC agreement. The PBC carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee. The Government of Zimbabwe, in turn, used the proceeds of the PBC to on-lend to TelOne, a state-owned telecommunications company at a 5% interest rate. The ultimate borrower (TelOne) was expected to use the loan proceeds to finance 85% of the cost of its $116.8 million commercial contract with Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. The remaining 15% was to be directly funded by TelOne. The guarantor of the loan is NetOne (Private) Limited.   The borrower is expected to maintain a minimum cash balance in an escrow account (debt service reserve account) at China Eximbank. The balance of the escrow account was $0 as of December 31, 2016, $4,341,790 as of December 31, 2017, $4,343,991 as of December 31, 2018, ZWL 220,015,319 as of December 31, 2019, ZWL 157,681,155 as of December 31, 2020, ZWL 720,123,439 as of December 31, 2021, and ZWL 1,294,710,690 as of December 31, 2022. In the event that the funds in the escrow account are insufficient to repay the interest and the principal of the loan, the PBC agreement indicates that the extra revenues from an escrow account that was set up for another China Eximbank-financed project (Phase 3 of NetOne Expansion Project, which is captured in Project ID#52620) will be used to settle the TelOne loan.   The borrower is responsible for making 30, equal semiannual repayments between January 21, 2022 and January 21, 2037. The first drawdown (disbursement) took place on March 14, 2017.  Total loan disbursements amounted to $78,630,649 in 2017 and $14,355,910 in 2018. As of September 2019, TelOne reported that the China Eximbank loan (PBC) had almost fully disbursed ($98,495,973 out of $98,617,482). By 2021, the borrower had accumulated arrears. The loan's amount outstanding (including principal, interest, and arrears) was $104,067,388.34 as of 2021.  The purpose of the TelOne Broadband Expansion Project is to replace, upgrade, and transform the state-owned company’s transmission backbone call and access network into a modern telecommunications infrastructure providing a wide range of voice data and video services.   TelOne completed the first phase of the project between 2010 and 2013 at a cost of $18.2 million, of which the Government of Zimbabwe contributed $6.2 million and TelOne contributed $12 million from its own resources. Phase 1 supported the following routes: Harare-Mutare Fibre Optic Transmission, Harare-Bulawayo Optic Transmission and installation of the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls Internet Protocol Microwave Radio Link.   Phase 2, which was supported by China Eximbank, focused on the following project components: capacity upgrades in Mashonaland Central and West Provinces; the Bulawayo-Beitbridge Fibre Optic Transmission Route; the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls Fibre Optic Transmission Route; the Gweru-Masvingo Fibre Optic Transmission Route; and the supply, installation and commissioning of internet protocol multi-media systems access and converged billing system. Huawei Technologies was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Phase 2 of this project commenced on or around February 1, 2017. Then, on October 10, 2017, TelOne announced the completion of the laying of 330 km of fiber optic cable. On March 13, 2019, Zimbabwean President E.D. Mnangagwa officially commissioned the TelOne Beitbridge-Masvingo-Harare Optic Fibre Link (a sub-project under Phase 2 of the TelOne Broadband Expansion Project). As of September 2019, TelOne reported that it had completed Phase 2. The completion of this project reportedly achieved a better billing system, faster internet speed, improved voice call quality, and better performance of TelOne’s toll free and interactive voice response services.   However, there are signs that the China Eximbank loan contracted by the TelOne for the Phase 2 of the TelOne Broadband Expansion Project has underperformed financially. According to a report released by the Debt Management Office of Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance in mid-2022, the loan was in arrears at the end of 2021.  By the end of 2021, the Government of Zimbabwe's total external debt arrears to China Eximbank included $13 million for the NetOne Expansion Phase 1 Project, $47 million for the NetOne Expansion Phase 2 Project, $67 million for the Rehabilitation of Municipal Water and Sewage Treatment Works Project (City of Harare Project), $7 million for the National Defence College Project, $54 million for the Victoria Falls Airport Renovation and Expansion Project, $3 million for the Robert G.

Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance used the loan proceeds to on-lend to Hwange Electricity Supply Company (HESCO), which is a special purpose vehicle (project company) that is jointly owned by Zimbabwe Power Company (64% equity stake) and Sinohydro (36% equity stake). HESCO entered into a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) to off-take electricity from the constructed Hwange 7 & 8 Thermal Power Station. HESCO is expected to service the China Eximbank PBC with revenue derived from power sales to ZETDC.    The total cost of the 600 MW Hwange Makomo Power Station Expansion Project is $2.148 billion and it is being implemented on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30. Standard Bank (unknown amount) and AfreximBank ($176 million) are the other sources of debt financing. 85% of the cost of HESCO’s engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract with Sinohydro will be covered by the China Eximbank PBC. The remaining 15% ($176 million) will be provided through an equity contribution from Sinohydro. The purpose of the project is to construct Unit 7 and Unit 8 at the Hwange Makomo Power Station, and thereby increase the power generation capacity of the Hwange Makomo Power Station from 600 MW to 1200 MW (through the addition of two power generation units). Hwange Makomo Power Station is a coal-fired power plant and the 14th largest thermal station in the Southern African region. It is adjacent to the Wankie Colliery Open Cast Mine.   The station was built in two stages. The first four power generation (4x120 MW) units were commissioned between 1983 and 1986 and the fifth and sixth power generation (2x220 MW) units were commissioned in 1986 and 1987. These six units are already functional and the station currently generates about 40% percent of the country’s electricity needs. Coal is delivered to the station by an overland conveyor belt which is 6 kilometers long from Hwange Colliery Company Limited (HCCL) as well as by trucks from Makomo and Coalbrick mines. Water that is piped 44 kilometers from the Zambezi River is pumped into two 150,000-cubic-meter reservoirs next to the station and conveyed by gravity to its point of use. Sinohydro is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation and it has hired 2532 employees (620 Chinese workers and 1912 local workers) as well as 252 sub-contractor employees (including 217 local workers). After the PBC agreement with China Eximbank was signed on December 1, 2015, the lender demanded that the Government of Zimbabwe meet several conditions, including parliamentary ratification of the PBC; the establishment of a debt service reserve agreement (DSRA) between the Government of Zimbabwe, China Eximbank and HESCO; the establishment of a PPA between HESCO and Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC); the establishment of an agreement between Government of Zimbabwe and HESCO outlining the incentives for the project (in terms of taxation) and guaranteeing ZETDC’s payments to HESCO; the signing of a coal supply agreement between HESCO and Makomo Resources, and the signing of a limestone supply agreement between HESCO and PPC (Zimbabwe). These requirements led to project implementation delays.    The first loan disbursement from China Eximbank took place in June 2018, which paved the way for project commencement on August 1, 2018. The project was originally expected to reach completion within 42 months (February 1, 2022). A formal groundbreaking ceremony was organized on June 27, 2018. Then, on March 1, 2019, a foundation stone laying ceremony took place. As of November 2019, the project had achieved a 25% completion rate. Then, in September 2020, reports emerged that the borrower had failed to comply with the terms of its escrow account agreement with China Eximbank and it instead issued a savings bond as collateral (security) in favor of the lender. By February 2021, the project was running behind schedule; it had achieved a 58.29% completion rate (against a target completion rate of 78.5%). The delay was attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and unpaid invoices (IPC payments). As of April 2022, Forbes Chanakira, a project manager for the Hwange Makomo Power Station Expansion, reported that the project had achieved an 84.2% completion (progress) rate. He reported that the turbines and generator sets for Unit 7 had been constructed and were awaiting commissioning. At that time, the boiler was about 93% complete and the coal stockyard was expected to be operational in May 2022. The boiler’s control system, the Distributed Control System (DCS), had also been activated. Hot commissioning, a process in which coal is used in the boiler to heat steam, was expected at the time to begin by July 2022. It was expected to last until November 2022 when the unit would be handed off.    Forbes Chanakira also stated in April 2022 that about 810 of the 875 transmission towers built between Hwange and Bulawayo had been placed. At the time, on the 368 km section between Hwange and Bulawayo, a new 400KV line — that would run parallel to the current lines — still needed to be built. The route had been separated into three sections: Bulawayo to Lupane, Lupane to Gwayi, and Gwayi to Hwange, where engineers were working on building towers alongside other construction work. At one point, this project had employed 450 people, but the project ultimately is expected to employ more than 3,000 people.",1. This project is also known as the Hwange 7 & 8 Thermal Power Station Expansion Project. The Chinese project title is 万吉火电站扩容项目. 2. There is some evidence that supplemental funding may have been secured by Hwange Electricity Supply Company (HESCO) — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) — in 2018 for the 600 MW Hwange Makomo Power Station Expansion Project. This issue warrants further investigation.,"# Sector

China Eximbank provides $997.7 million preferential buyer’s credit for 600 MW Hwange Makomo Power Station Expansion Project

# Description
On December 1, 2015, the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank) and Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance signed a $997.7 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the 600 MW Hwange Makomo Power Station Expansion Project. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0.25% management fee, and a 0.25% commitment fee. It disbursed $200 million in June 2018, $129.6 million in 2020, $33.83 million in 2021, and $171.6 million in 2022.
