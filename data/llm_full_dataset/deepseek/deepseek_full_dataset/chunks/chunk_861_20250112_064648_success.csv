Then, on July 22, 2016, China Development Bank (CDB) and the Government of Zambia’s Ministry of Finance signed a $170 million loan agreement for the Solar-Powered Milling Plants Project. The loan reportedly carries a 12-year maturity and an interest rate of LIBOR plus 350 basis points. It is backed by a Sinsoure credit insurance policy. In order to facilitate loan repayment, Zambia Cooperative Federation (ZCF) created a special account into which various agricultural cooperatives (participating in the project and benefiting from the solar-powered milling plants) were required to deposit 1,700 kwachas (about $100) per month for a period of 15 years. At the end of the 15-year period, the solar-powered milling plants will become the property of the various agricultural cooperatives.

The Government of Zambia is responsible for providing the remaining $30 million in counterpart financing.   As of December 2018, CDB had released $150 million and the Government of Zambia had released $20 million in support of this project.

The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was expected to use the proceeds from the PBC to finance 85% of a $150 million commercial contract between Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company (LWSC) and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) Zambia Limited, which was signed in January 2013. The Government of Zambia agreed to directly finance the remaining 15% ($22.5 million) of the commercial contract cost.   The project involved the construction of a new raw water abstraction station on the Kafue River, a water treatment plant, a 66 km treated water pipeline from Kafue to Lusaka, and a booster station in Chilanga and transmission lines to deliver a total of 50,000m3/day of water into the existing Stuart Park storage facilities in Lusaka. The ultimate objective of the project was to improve water supply to Lusaka and surrounding areas. Upon completion, the project was expected to benefit 480,000 people in Lusaka and surrounding areas.   China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) Zambia Limited was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company (LWSC). A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 20, 2016. However, construction did not begin until September 5, 2016. It was originally anticipated that the project would be completed by November 2018. However, this did not occur due to delays in the delivery of water distribution pipelines. The scope of the project was also revised during implementation to include additional works involving the construction of the Iolanda intake structure (at the Iolanda water treatment plant) and the installation of the Chilanga Booster Pump to meet the power requirements of the project. On September 17, 2020, the President of Zambia visited the project site and affirmed the construction quality and progress of the project. As of December 2020, the project had achieved a 96% completion rate. On July 29, 2022, a project completion ceremony took place. At the ceremony, Zambian president Hakainde Hichilema said that the completion of the project would ensure that about 500,000 people in the Zambian capital have access to clean and safe water as well as proper sanitation. Eric Ding, the general manager of the CCECC Zambia, thanked the Zambian government and the local people for their support during the construction period.

China Eximbank provides $127.5 million preferential buyer's credit for Phase I of Lusaka-Kafue Bulk Water Supply Project (Linked to Project ID#98552)

# Description
In May 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Zambia signed a $127.5 million preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement for the Phase I of Lusaka-Kafue Bulk Water Supply Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was expected to use the proceeds from the PBC to finance 85% of a $150 million commercial contract between Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company (LWSC) and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) Zambia Limited, which was signed in January 2013. The Government of Zambia agreed to directly finance the remaining 15% ($22.5 million) of the commercial contract cost.   The project involved the construction of a new raw water abstraction station on the Kafue River, a water treatment plant, a 66 km treated water pipeline from Kafue to Lusaka, and a booster station in Chilanga and transmission lines to deliver a total of 50,000m3/day of water into the existing Stuart Park storage facilities in Lusaka. The ultimate objective of the project was to improve water supply to Lusaka and surrounding areas. Upon completion, the project was expected to benefit 480,000 people in Lusaka and surrounding areas.   China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) Zambia Limited was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company (LWSC). A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 20, 2016. However, construction did not begin until September 5, 2016. It was originally anticipated that the project would be completed by November 2018. However, this did not occur due to delays in the delivery of water distribution pipelines. The scope of the project was also revised during implementation to include additional works involving the construction of the Iolanda intake structure (at the Iolanda water treatment plant) and the installation of the Chilanga Booster Pump to meet the power requirements of the project. On September 17, 2020, the President of Zambia visited the project site and affirmed the construction quality and progress of the project. As of December 2020, the project had achieved a 96% completion rate. On July 29, 2022, a project completion ceremony took place. At the ceremony, Zambian president Hakainde Hichilema said that the completion of the project would ensure that about 500,000 people in the Zambian capital have access to clean and safe water as well as proper sanitation. Eric Ding, the general manager of the CCECC Zambia, thanked the Zambian government and the local people for their support during the construction period. He, however, said more financing will be required to undertake the second phase of the project to increase the water supply to the Zambian capital due to the increased population which requires more water. 1,000 local residents were reportedly employed and trained at the peak of the construction phase of the project.

53044,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Development Bank provides additional $29.5 million loan for Upgrading of Mansa-Luwingu Road Project (Linked to Project ID#30719),"In 2013, China Development Bank (CDB) and the Government of Zambia signed a $175.92 million loan agreement for the Upgrading of Mansa-Luwingu Road Project (captured via Project ID#30719). The precise borrowing terms of this loan are unknown. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $206.96 million commercial contract between the Road Development Agency (RDA) of Zambia and China Henan International Cooperation Group Company Ltd., which was signed on December 27, 2012. The Government of Zambia was responsible for providing the remaining $31.04 million via counterpart funding. As of 2014, CDB had disbursed $64.67 million from this loan. The Government of Zambia soon realized it did not have enough tax or non-tax revenue to meet its initial counterpart funding commitment. Therefore, in 2016, CDB issued an additional $29.5 million loan to the Government of Zambia (captured via Project ID#53044). This loan, which is also known as the Mansa-Luwingu Road Project (M3) Amendment, carried the following borrowing terms: 10-year maturity, 3-year grace period, 5.558% interest rate (LIBOR plus 450 basis points), 0.5% commitment fee, and 0.5% management fee. The Upgrading of Mansa-Luwingu Road Project had two components: the upgrading of a 175 kilometer M3 road from Mansa to Luwingu and upgrading 30 kilometers of urban roads from Mansa and Luwingu. The purpose of the project was to more effectively connect Mansa province with Luwingu province, and thereby reduce the cost of exporting copper products, agricultural products and other goods. The project was also expected to generate 1,200 jobs and take approximately 40 months to complete. China Henan International Cooperation Group Company Ltd. was the contractor responsible for project implementation. The project was ultimately completed on July 18, 2016.","1.
