(“Nevsun”). Under the terms of the agreement, ENAMCO agreed to purchase a 30% ownership stake in the Bisha Mining Share Company (BMSC) from Nevsun Resources Ltd., which with the Government of Eritrea’s 10% free carried interest brought ENAMCO’s total ownership stake in BMSC to 40%. Then, in November 2007, China Eximbank issued an $80 million commercial loan to the Government of Eritrea for Phase 1 of Bisha Gold Mine Project.   The proceeds of this loan were use to partially fund ENAMCO’s acquisition of a 30% ownership interest in the Bisha Gold Mine. Then, on July 12, 2010, China Eximbank issued a $60 million follow-on loan to the Government of Eritrea for Phase 2 of the Bisha Gold Mine Project. The loan agreement for Phase 2 was signed by China Eximbank President Li Ruogu and the Eritrean Minister of Finance Berhane Abrehe It is unknown how the proceeds of this loan were used. The China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 is captured in Project ID#56386 and the China Eximbank loan for Phase 2 is captured in Project ID#73371. Construction of the mine began in September 2008 and was completed by 2010. The mine began the commercial production of gold in February 22, 2011, which allowed for an early payback of gold phase capital and allowed for complete funding of both the copper and zinc phase expansions. Then, the mine transitioned from gold production to copper production in late H2 2013 and commenced commercial production of copper in December 2013 and commercial production of zinc in October 2016 following the completion of the zinc expansion project. Then, on August 31, 2018, China Construction Bank Corporation (“CCBC”) issued a binding commitment letter in which it agreed to fully underwrite a $870,000,000 (approximately C$1.1 billion) loan to Gold Mountains (H.K.) International Mining Company Limited — a wholly-owned subsidiary of Zijin Mining — to facilitate the acquisition of a 55% ownership stake in Nevsun Resources Ltd. (captured via Project ID#89500).

Zijin Mining intended to repay all borrowings under the Bank of China loan facility and CCBC loan facility using cash flows from its operations and existing cash on hand. The two principal properties of Nevsun Resources Ltd. were the Timok Project in Serbia, which hosts the copper-gold Cukaru Peki deposit on the Brestovac-Metovnica exploration permit, and the Bisha Project in Eritrea, which hosts the copper-zinc-gold Bisha deposit and includes potential satellite VMS deposits at Harena, Northwest, Hambok and Asheli.

Chinese Government provides grant for Dr. Mei Gengnian Road Construction Project

# Description
On April 5, 2018, the Mei Gengnian road was opened in Ethiopia. The opening ceremony was held in Baji Village on the outskirts of Jimma City. According to the Chinese embassy in Ethiopia, the road was financed by the Chinese government and built by the China Communication Construction Company (CCCC). The CCCC also agreed to provide ongoing maintenance for the road. Ambassador Tan Jian, Jimma Mayor McKee, representatives of China Communications Construction Company, the contractor of Mei Gennian Road, and village representatives each delivered speeches. Hundreds of people, including Jimma City government officials, local villagers, and CCCC employees, attended the event.  The Mei Gengnian road is 500m long and connects the main road to the tomb of Dr. Mei Gengnian, a medical doctor who sacrificed his life in Ethiopia and was buried in Baji Village. It is unclear how much the road cost, when construction began, and which specific branch of the Chinese government financed the road.
