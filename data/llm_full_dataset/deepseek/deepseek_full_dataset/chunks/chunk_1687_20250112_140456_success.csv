34119,ENERGY,CGNTIEZ provides $20 million supplier credit for 74MW Kyi-Ohn Kyi-Wa Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project,"On July 7, 2004, the China Guangdong New Technology Import and Export Zhuhai Company (CGNTIEZ) signed a $20 million supplier credit agreement with the Government of Myanmar’s Department of Irrigation (Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation) for the 74MW Kyi-Ohn Kyi-Wa Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project. The supplier credit carried a maturity of 7 years. However, its interest rate and grace period are unknown. The proceeds from the supplier credit were to be used by the borrower to facilitate the acquisition and installation of equipment — including supply turbine generators, watergate doors, steel pipes, water sluice doors, a switchyard and a powerhouse — from CGNTIEZ for the construction of the Kyi-Ohn Kyi-Wa hydroelectric power plant on the Mone Chaung River within Sidoktaya township, Minbu district, and Magway state (exact locational coordinates:  20.331000, 94.416000).   The project scope included a 50 meter high earth dam that would create a reservoir inundating 33 km2 and storing of 571 hm3. The 74 MW power plant would be located at the toe of the dam. Two diversion weirs would divert water for irrigation downstream of the Kyeeon Kyeewa power plant before the Mone Chaung reaches the Ayeyarwady. The power plant would be connected to Mann substation by a 70 km long 132 kV transmission line. CGNTIEZ was the contractor responsible for implementation.
