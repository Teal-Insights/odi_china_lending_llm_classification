92310,ENERGY,"[CPEC] China Eximbank contributes to $1.292 billion syndicated loan for 720MW Karot Hydropower Project (Linked to Project ID#54012, #92311, #37233)","In May 2007, Karot Power Company Limited (KPCL) obtained a letter of interest from Pakistan’s Private Power Infrastructure Board (PPIB) to develop the 720 MW Karot Hydropower Project. KPCL is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that was created for the purpose of financing, building, operating and maintaining the 720 MW run-of-the-river Karot hydropower plant on the Jhelum River in Pakistan. China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Limited (C-SAIL)—an investment holding company formed by China Three Gorges Corporation on September 30, 2011 in the Cayman Islands, to acquire, develop, build, own and operate renewable power generation projects in Pakistan—holds a 93% ownership stake in KPCL, while Pakistan's Associated Technologies holds a 7% ownership stake in KPCL.   In October 2009, PPIB approved a feasibility study report for the 720MW Karot hydropower project and Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) granted KPCL a generation license to develop the project on November 2013. Then, on September 9, 2016, KPCL and the Central Power Purchasing Agency–Guarantee (CPPA-G) signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for the Karot Hydropower Project.   On February 22, 2017, China Development Bank (CDB), the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank), and the Silk Road Fund (SRF) signed a $1.292 billion syndicated buyer's credit (loan) agreement with Karot Power Company (Pvt.) Ltd. (KPCL) for the 720 MW Karot Hydropower Project (captured via Project ID#37233). The borrowing terms of the loan are as follows: a maturity of 17 years, a grace period of 6 years, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 4.75% margin, a 1% arrangement (management), and a 0.5% commitment fee. The borrower is expected to make equal, semi-annual repayments on April 21 and October 21 of each year during the loan's repayment period.  The total cost of the 720 MW Karot Hydropower Project, excluding contingencies, was $1.74 billion and it was financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. The World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation (IFC) issued a $100 million loan in support of the project on November 25, 2016. The remaining $1.292 billion of debt financing was provided by this syndicate of Chinese state-owned lenders. CDB's contribution is captured via Project ID#37233. China Eximbank's contribution is captured in Project ID#92310. The Silk Road Fund's contribution is captured via Project ID#92311.  The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $1.6 billion commercial (EPC) contract with Yangtze Three Gorges Technology & Economy Development Co., Ltd. (TGDC). Sinosure also issued a buyer’s credit insurance policy at a cost of $54.3 million, and the borrower pledged the following sources of collateral to the lending syndicate: fixed (project) assets, future rights to electricity charges, and the Sinosure credit insurance policy. Additionally, China Three Gorges Corporation reportedly made a $316.20 million equity investment in project, while Associated Technologies reportedly made a $23.90 million equity investment (captured via Project ID#54012).  The purpose of the independent power project (IPP) is to construct a 720MW hydropower generation complex — with four, 180MW power generation units — near Karot village, some 1.7 kilometers upstream of Karot Bridge and 74 km upstream of Mangla Dam. The project involves the construction of a roc-filled dam, spillway, powerhouse, diversion tunnels, head-race power tunnels and a tail-race tunnel end. The project site is accessible through the Islamabad – Kahuta – Kotli road, approximately 29 kilometers from Kahuta, and 65 kilometers from Islamabad. Upon completion, the power plant is expected to generate 2,970 GWh (net) of clean energy annually and reduce 2.3 million tons of carbon emissions each year. The IPP is being implemented on a Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) basis. KPCL will sell all its energy to the National Transmission and Dispatch Company Limited (NTDC) under a 30-year power purchase agreement [at a levelized tariff of Rs 7.68 (7.57 cents) per unit]. The Government of Pakistan GoP guaranteed the (power purchase) payment obligations of the NTDC to the KPCL.  The Government of Pakistan also issued a 17% return on equity (ROE) guarantee.   The general EPC contractor responsible for implementation is Yangtze Three Gorges Technology & Economy Development Co., Ltd (TGDC). China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) is also involved in implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on April 20, 2015. A construction mobilization ceremony was held on January 10, 2016. A project implementation agreement was signed on September 28, 2016. Then, a “notice to proceed"" was issued to (TGDC) on December 1, 2016. Construction works were 25% complete as of September 2017. On September 22, 2018, the project successfully achieved river closure. Construction works were 70% complete as of January 2020. Then, on May 2, 2021, the first rotor of the power plant was successfully hoisted into place. Construction works were 88% complete as of May 2021. On November 20, 2021, the hydropower station closed the gates of its diversion tunnels and started water storage in its reservoir for future use. To date, the project has reportedly employed 3000-5000 people. The originally expected commercial operation date (COD) of the hydropower plant was December 28, 2021. KPCL is responsible for handing over this project to the Pakistani government after the term of its 30-year concession agreement has expired.  The project has been the subject of local controversy. In August 2019, a complaint was submitted to the IFC’s Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO) by a former employee of the project. The complaint raised concerns about lack of payment of exit wages, as well as discrimination against local workers in relation to access to drinking water, conditions of accommodations and transportation at the project site. Then, in July 2020, a complaint was lodged with CAO by representatives of Building and Wood Workers International (BWI) and the Pakistan Federation of Building and Wood Workers (PFBWW), on behalf of the Awami Labor Union. The complaint raises a range of social issues related to the working conditions and terms of employment, workers' organizations, and grievance redress mechanism at the Karot hydropower plant. The complainants claimed adverse impacts on approximately 3,000 project workers, including violations of IFC Performance Standard 2 on workers’ organizations, health and safety, working conditions and terms of employment, grievance mechanisms, retrenchment, and concerns related to the use of security forces under IFC Performance Standard 4.  There are also some indications that the syndicated loan for the 720MW Karot Hydropower Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lenders. In March 2023, KPCL sought Rs 22.703 billion from Central Power Purchasing Agency–Guarantee (CPPA-G) by April 10, 2023 to settle its outstanding debts (including principal and interest) to SRF, CDB, China Eximbank, and IFC and avoid default.  In a letter to Rehan Akhtar, the CEO of CPPA-G, KPCL’s CEO Wang Minsheng noted that his company had to make mandatory principal, interest, and commitment fee payments and any delays in payment would result in a breach of covenants resulting in an event of default for the company.  He noted that, per section 2.05 of the facility agreements signed by KPCL and its lenders, his company needed to make its second loan repayment (equivalent to 3.31 percent of the outstanding loan amount, or Rs. 22.703 billion) by April 21, 2023. KPCL therefore requested that CPPA-G pay its overdue invoices (receivables) -- worth Rs 4.937 billion -- by April 10, 2023. At the time, invoices were being submitted based on a reference tariff without indexation determined by NEPRA on the actual costs incurred by KPCL at the time of Commercial Operation Date (COD) stage tariff.","1. The Chinese project title is 720兆瓦 Karot水电项目的.2. The IMF reports that the loan's all-in interest rate is 5.11% (6-month LIBOR of .36% + a 4.75% margin). However, KPCL’s tariff generation application to NEPRA (prior to financial close) cites an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.36%) plus a 4.5% margin. For the time being, AidData has elected to use the IMF’s estimate since it was obtained after financial close.3. According to multiple, official sources, the Government of Pakistan has issued sovereign guarantees in support of all loans issued by Chinese state-owned banks for independent power projects (IPPs) in Pakistan (see https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cepk/chn/zbgx/t1735166.htm and http://pk.chineseembassy.org/eng/zbgx/202110/t20211010_9558510.htm and https://www.dropbox.com/s/bmx3w2b38o7guxm/Debt%20Pricing%20of%20IPPs%20%28002%29.pdf?dl=0). As such, AidData assumes that the loan captured in this record is backed by a sovereign guarantee from the Government of Pakistan.4. The individual contributions of the China Eximbank, CDB, and Silk Road Fund to the $1.292 billion syndicated loan are unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes that all three lenders contributed equal amounts ($430,666,666.67).5. This project was the very first hydroelectric independent power project (IPP) to be financed by Chinese banks in Pakistan.6. This transaction has been described as a limited recourse project financial transaction, which implies that that syndicated loan is secured by (collateralized against) the project assets and paid entirely from project cash flow, rather than from the general assets or creditworthiness of the project sponsors.7. On August 29, 2013, KPCL identified the total cost of its Sinosure insurance policy as $54.3 million (see https://nepra.org.pk/tariff/Tariff/IPPs/karoot%20hydro%20power/Determination%20of%20the%20authority%20in%20the%20matter%20of%20EPC%20Stage%20tariff%20of%20Karot%20Power.PDF).8. The Silk Road Fund (SFR) is a medium- to long term state-owned special fund supporting projects under the Belt and Road Initiative. It focuses on equity investments but also provides other types of financing. It is funded by China's State Administration on Foreign Exchange (SAFE), CDB, China Eximbank, and China Investment Corporation (CIC).9. China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Limited (the “C-SAIL” or “CSAIL”) is a newly formed investment holding company that will acquire, develop, build, own and operate renewable power generation projects in Pakistan and other territories duly approved by the board of the directors of CSAIL. The company’s current multi-stage project pipeline is about US$5.5 billion, comprising of solar, wind and hydro projects with a cumulative capacity of over 2,000 MW, including 1820MW in two large hydro projects. CSAIL aims to become the largest renewable power company in Pakistan. The project marks the entry of a large and experienced sponsor with a significant investment program in Pakistan''s electricity market that needs an investment of around US$15-20 billion to develop 10,000MW of additional generation capacity in the next 5 years to overcome the supply shortfall. CSAIL, a wholly owned subsidiary of CWE Investment Corporation (“CWEI”) through CWEI Hongkong Investment Company Limited is a holding company for investment in Pakistan under which single purpose vehicles will be formed for the project financing of each of the projects. CWEI is the overseas investment subsidiary of state-owned China Three Gorges Corporation (“CTGC”). CTGC is one of the largest power companies in the world that owns and operates several multi-stage hydro, solar and wind generation projects in China and globally, with a cumulative capacity of over 50,000 MW. Founded in August 2011, CWEI is a wholly owned subsidiary of CTGC and serves as the dedicated overseas investment platform, responsible for investment, construction, operation and management of the international businesses of CTGC. Leveraging on the financial strength and technical capabilities of CTGC, CWEI is pursuing the development of hydro, wind and solar generation projects across South Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe, America and Africa. CWEI is also the largest shareholder in Energias de Portugal (“EDP”), which is an integrated utility company that generates, distributes, and supplies electricity in Portugal and through EDP Renovaives, it is one of the largest wind power producers in the world. CWEI will maintain a majority 51% equity stake in CSAIL until a Qualified Public Offering and in addition to IFC, other regional and international institutional investors, including development financial institutions, sovereign wealth funds and private equity funds are expected to take minority shareholding in CSAIL.10. In addition to the syndicated buyer's credit for the 720MW Karot Hydropower Project, China Development Bank (CDB) supported two separate loans for the Karot Wind Power Projects (captured via Project ID#53675 and #54317).","# Sector

This transaction has been described as a limited recourse project financial transaction, which implies that that syndicated loan is secured by (collateralized against) the project assets and paid entirely from project cash flow, rather than from the general assets or creditworthiness of the project sponsors.7. On August 29, 2013, KPCL identified the total cost of its Sinosure insurance policy as $54.3 million (see https://nepra.org.pk/tariff/Tariff/IPPs/karoot%20hydro%20power/Determination%20of%20the%20authority%20in%20the%20matter%20of%20EPC%20Stage%20tariff%20of%20Karot%20Power.PDF).8. The Silk Road Fund (SFR) is a medium- to long term state-owned special fund supporting projects under the Belt and Road Initiative. It focuses on equity investments but also provides other types of financing. It is funded by China's State Administration on Foreign Exchange (SAFE), CDB, China Eximbank, and China Investment Corporation (CIC).9. China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Limited (the “C-SAIL” or “CSAIL”) is a newly formed investment holding company that will acquire, develop, build, own and operate renewable power generation projects in Pakistan and other territories duly approved by the board of the directors of CSAIL. The company’s current multi-stage project pipeline is about US$5.5 billion, comprising of solar, wind and hydro projects with a cumulative capacity of over 2,000 MW, including 1820MW in two large hydro projects. CSAIL aims to become the largest renewable power company in Pakistan. The project marks the entry of a large and experienced sponsor with a significant investment program in Pakistan''s electricity market that needs an investment of around US$15-20 billion to develop 10,000MW of additional generation capacity in the next 5 years to overcome the supply shortfall. CSAIL, a wholly owned subsidiary of CWE Investment Corporation (“CWEI”) through CWEI Hongkong Investment Company Limited is a holding company for investment in Pakistan under which single purpose vehicles will be formed for the project financing of each of the projects. CWEI is the overseas investment subsidiary of state-owned China Three Gorges Corporation (“CTGC”). CTGC is one of the largest power companies in the world that owns and operates several multi-stage hydro, solar and wind generation projects in China and globally, with a cumulative capacity of over 50,000 MW. Founded in August 2011, CWEI is a wholly owned subsidiary of CTGC and serves as the dedicated overseas investment platform, responsible for investment, construction, operation and management of the international businesses of CTGC. Leveraging on the financial strength and technical capabilities of CTGC, CWEI is pursuing the development of hydro, wind and solar generation projects across South Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe, America and Africa. CWEI is also the largest shareholder in Energias de Portugal (“EDP”), which is an integrated utility company that generates, distributes, and supplies electricity in Portugal and through EDP Renovaives, it is one of the largest wind power producers in the world. CWEI will maintain a majority 51% equity stake in CSAIL until a Qualified Public Offering and in addition to IFC, other regional and international institutional investors, including development financial institutions, sovereign wealth funds and private equity funds are expected to take minority shareholding in CSAIL.10. In addition to the syndicated buyer's credit for the 720MW Karot Hydropower Project, China Development Bank (CDB) supported two separate loans for the Karot Wind Power Projects (as captured via Project ID#53675 and #54317).","# Sector

# Title
[CPEC] Silk Road Fund contributes to $1.292 billion syndicated loan for 720MW Karot Hydropower Project (Linked to Project ID#54012, #92310, #37233)

# Description
In May 2007, Karot Power Company Limited (KPCL) obtained a letter of interest from Pakistan’s Private Power Infrastructure Board (PPIB) to develop the 720 MW Karot Hydropower Project. KPCL is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that was created for the purpose of financing, building, operating and maintaining the 720 MW run-of-the-river Karot hydropower plant on the Jhelum River in Pakistan. China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Limited (C-SAIL)—an investment holding company formed by China Three Gorges Corporation on September 30, 2011 in the Cayman Islands, to acquire, develop, build, own and operate renewable power generation projects in Pakistan—holds a 93% ownership stake in KPCL, while Pakistan's Associated Technologies holds a 7% ownership stake in KPCL.   In October 2009, PPIB approved a feasibility study report for the 720MW Karot hydropower project and Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) granted KPCL a generation license to develop the project on November 2013. Then, on September 9, 2016, KPCL and the Central Power Purchasing Agency–Guarantee (CPPA-G) signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for the Karot Hydropower Project.   On February 22, 2017, China Development Bank (CDB), the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank), and the Silk Road Fund (SRF) signed a $1.292 billion syndicated buyer's credit (loan) agreement with Karot Power Company (Pvt.) Ltd. (KPCL) for the 720 MW Karot Hydropower Project (captured via Project ID#37233). The borrowing terms of the loan are as follows: a maturity of 17 years, a grace period of 6 years, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 4.75% margin, a 1% arrangement (management), and a 0.5% commitment fee. The borrower is expected to make equal, semi-annual repayments on April 21 and October 21 of each year during the loan's repayment period.  The total cost of the 720 MW Karot Hydropower Project, excluding contingencies, was $1.74 billion and it was financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. The World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation (IFC) issued a $100 million loan in support of the project on November 25, 2016. The remaining $1.292 billion of debt financing was provided by this syndicate of Chinese state-owned lenders. CDB's contribution is captured via Project ID#37233. China Eximbank's contribution is captured in Project ID#92310. The Silk Road Fund's contribution is captured via Project ID#92311.  The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $1.6 billion commercial (EPC) contract with Yangtze Three Gorges Technology & Economy Development Co., Ltd. (TGDC). Sinosure also issued a buyer’s credit insurance policy at a cost of $54.3 million, and the borrower pledged the following sources of collateral to the lending syndicate: fixed (project) assets, future rights to electricity charges, and the Sinosure credit insurance policy. Additionally, China Three Gorges Corporation reportedly made a $316.20 million equity investment in project, while Associated Technologies reportedly made a $23.90 million equity investment (captured via Project ID#54012).  The purpose of the independent power project (IPP) is to construct a 720MW hydropower generation complex — with four, 180MW power generation units — near Karot village, some 1.7 kilometers upstream of Karot Bridge and 74 km upstream of Mangla Dam. The project involves the construction of a roc-filled dam, spillway, powerhouse, diversion tunnels, head-race power tunnels and a tail-race tunnel end. The project site is accessible through the Islamabad – Kahuta – Kotli road, approximately 29 kilometers from Kahuta, and 65 kilometers from Islamabad. Upon completion, the power plant is expected to generate 2,970 GWh (net) of clean energy annually and reduce 2.3 million tons of carbon emissions each year. The IPP is being implemented on a Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) basis. KPCL will sell all its energy to the National Transmission and Dispatch Company Limited (NTDC) under a 30-year power purchase agreement [at a levelized tariff of Rs 7.68 (7.57 cents) per unit]. The Government of Pakistan GoP guaranteed the (power purchase) payment obligations of the NTDC to the KPCL.  The Government of Pakistan also issued a 17% return on equity (ROE) guarantee.   The general EPC contractor responsible for implementation is Yangtze Three Gorges Technology & Economy Development Co., Ltd (TGDC). China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) is also involved in implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on April 20, 2015. A construction mobilization ceremony was held on January 10, 2016. A project implementation agreement was signed on September 28, 2016. Then, a “notice to proceed"" was issued to (TGDC) on December 1, 2016. Construction works were 25% complete as of September 2017. On September 22, 2018, the project successfully achieved river closure. Construction works were 70% complete as of January 2020. Then, on May 2, 2021, the first rotor of the power plant was successfully hoisted into place. Construction works were 88% complete as of May 2021. On November 20, 2021, the hydropower station closed the gates of its diversion tunnels and started water storage in its reservoir for future use. To date, the project has reportedly employed 3000-5000 people. The originally expected commercial operation date (COD) of the hydropower plant was December 28, 2021. KPCL is responsible for handing over this project to the Pakistani government after the term of its 30-year concession agreement has expired.  The project has been the subject of local controversy. In August 2019, a complaint was submitted to the IFC’s Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO) by a former employee of the project. The complaint raised concerns about lack of payment of exit wages, as well as discrimination against local workers in relation to access to drinking water, conditions of accommodations and transportation at the project site. Then, in July 2020, a complaint was lodged with CAO by representatives of Building and Wood Workers International (BWI) and the Pakistan Federation of Building and Wood Workers (PFBWW), on behalf of the Awami Labor Union. The complaint raises a range of social issues related to the working conditions and terms of employment, workers' organizations, and grievance redress mechanism at the Karot hydropower plant. The complainants claimed adverse impacts on approximately 3,000 project workers, including violations of IFC Performance Standard 2 on workers’ organizations, health and safety, working conditions and terms of employment, grievance mechanisms, retrenchment, and concerns related to the use of security forces under IFC Performance Standard 4.  There are also some indications that the syndicated loan for the 720MW Karot Hydropower Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lenders. In March 2023, KPCL sought Rs 22.703 billion from Central Power Purchasing Agency–Guarantee (CPPA-G) by April 10, 2023 to settle its outstanding debts (including principal and interest) to SRF, CDB, China Eximbank, and IFC and avoid default.  In a letter to Rehan Akhtar, the CEO of CPPA-G, KPCL’s CEO Wang Minsheng noted that his company had to make mandatory principal, interest, and commitment fee payments and any delays in payment would result in a breach of covenants resulting in an event of default for the company.  He noted that, per section 2.05 of the facility agreements signed by KPCL and its lenders, his company needed to make its second loan repayment (equivalent to 3.31 percent of the outstanding loan amount, or Rs. 22.703 billion) by April 21, 2023. KPCL therefore requested that CPPA-G pay its overdue invoices (receivables) -- worth Rs 4.937 billion -- by April 10, 2023. At the time, invoices were being submitted based on a reference tariff without indexation determined by NEPRA on the actual costs incurred by KPCL at the time of Commercial Operation Date (COD) stage tariff.",TRUE,NA,GREEN,HIGH,Hydropower,Primary purpose is renewable energy generation through a large-scale hydropower project,"720MW run-of-the-river hydropower plant, expected to generate 2,970 GWh of clean energy annually and reduce 2.3 million tons of carbon emissions each year"

Ltd. (CPHGC) signed a $1,496,000,000 syndicated loan agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned banks — including China Development Bank (CDB, lead arranger), the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank, co-lead arranger), the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Construction Bank Corporation (CCB), and Bank of Communications Co. Limited (BOCOM) — for the 2×660 MW Imported Coal Based Independent Power Generation Project at Hub. According to CPHGC's upfront tariff application to Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority, the estimated borrowing terms of the syndicated loan are as follows: a maturity period of 14 years, a grace period of 4 years, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 450 basis points (4.5%). The borrower purchased buyer's credit insurance from Sinosure. As sources of collateral, the borrower also pledged shareholdings, assets, accounts, electricity payment receivables, and its Sinosure insurance policy.   CDB's contribution is captured via Project ID#52423. China Eximbank's contribution is captured via Project ID#92387. ICBC's contribution is captured via Project ID#92388. CCB's contribution is captured via Project ID#92390. BOCOM's contribution is captured via Project ID#92391. The total cost of this independent power project (IPP) was $1.995 billion and it was financed according to a 75:25 debt-to-equity ratio.   CPHGC is a project company and joint venture of China Power International Holding Ltd (CPIH) and the Hub Power Company Limited (HUBCO) that was established to finance, design, and implement this 1320 MW imported coal based power project. CPIH has a 74% ownership stake and HUBCO has a 26% ownership stake in CPHGC. CPHGC was granted a generation license by Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) on September 8, 2016. The term of the license is 30 years from the date of the commencement of commercial operations. CPHGC also submitted an application for an upfront tariff determination with NEPRA, which was approved on February 12, 2016. Then, on January 25, 2017, the Implementation Agreement (IA) and Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) were signed.   The purpose of the project is to construct 2×660 MW coal fired units and a dedicated jetty terminal to import coal at Hub, Mouza Kund, Tehsil Gadani, Lasbela District, and Balochistan Province. Northwest Electric Power Design Institute Co. Ltd. (NWEPDI) and Tianjin Electric Power Construction Company Limited are the EPC contractors responsible for project design and implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on March 21, 2017, and on April 10, 2018, CPHGC entered into Operation and Maintenance (O&M) contract with a consortium that consists of CEEC Tianjin (Pakistan) Electric Power Construction (Private) Limited, China Energy Engineering Group, Tianjin Electric Power Construction Company Limited, and China Energy Engineering Group Science and Technology Development Company Limited to provide operation and maintenance service for the coal-fired electric power generation plant. The project reached its commercial operation date (COD) on August 17, 2019. Its originally expected commercial operation date was August 31, 2018. It is expected that this power plant will provide 9 billion kWh electricity to Pakistan’s national grid each year, thereby meeting the electricity needs of 4 million Pakistani households.   However, this project has encountered a number of revenue generation, debt repayment, and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. The Government of Pakistan fell behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to CPHGC. Total payment arrears, as of May 2022, amounted to PKR 71.6 billion (approximately $379,480,000), which reportedly brought the power plant to the brink of closure and CPHGC to the brink of default. It also became more difficult for CPHGC to source the coal needed to power the plant (due to the inability of a supplier to provide coal from Afghanistan and skyrocketing international coal prices). Then, in July 2022, CPHGC) revealed that the country’s central bank — the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) — had stopped making various payments relating to coal suppliers due to the limited availability of foreign exchange in the country, which resulted in a major accumulation of payment arrears. In a letter dated July 20, 2022, the CEO of CPHGC, Ren Lihui, wrote to Pakistan’s Secretary of Power and warned that ‘any further delay in […] payments [from the State Bank of Pakistan] can adversely affect the ability of CPHGC to operate smoothly.’ He also warned that ‘If the Government of Pakistan fails to fulfill its responsibilities or does not respond in a timely manner, any loss, damages or [liquidated damages] should be borne by the Government of Pakistan.’   Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this '[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Then, in March 2023, CPHGC warned that it was at risk of defaulting on its loan repayment obligations due to overdue power purchase payments from the Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guaranteed (CPPA-G)","1. The Chinese name of this project is 巴基斯坦中电胡布燃煤发电项目（1320MW).2. CPIH is a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC), which is one of the top five electricity producers in China. CPIH mainly engages in the development, construction, operation, overseas investment and financing, and capital operation of power generation projects. HUBCO is the largest Independent Power Producer (IPP) in Pakistan, with total power generation capacity of over 1600 MW. The company’s assets include a residual fuel oil-fired thermal plant situated at Mouza Kund, Hub, which supplies the national grid.3. According to multiple, official sources, the Government of Pakistan has issued sovereign guarantees in support of all loans issued by Chinese state-owned banks for independent power projects (IPPs) in Pakistan (see https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cepk/chn/zbgx/t1735166.htm and http://pk.chineseembassy.org/eng/zbgx/202110/t20211010_9558510.htm and https://www.dropbox.com/s/bmx3w2b38o7guxm/Debt%20Pricing%20of%20IPPs%20%28002%29.pdf?dl=0). As such, AidData assumes that the loan captured in this record is backed by a sovereign guarantee from the Government of Pakistan.4. This project did not achieve financial close until January 2018.5. This project is officially designated as being part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).6. AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate (6.042%) by adding 4.5% to the average 6-month LIBOR rate in October 2017 (1.542%).7. The individual contributions of China Eximbank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Development Bank, Bank of Communications, and China Construction Bank to the $1.496 billion syndicated loan are unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes that the five Chinese state-owned banks contributed equal amounts ($299,200,000).8. On November 8, 2014, the Chinese Government and the Government of Pakistan signed a CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement. According to Article 5 of the Agreement, ‘the Pakistani Party agrees that a revolving account shall be opened with 30 days of commercial operation of the respective project, into which the money, no less than the 22 per cent of the monthly payments for the respective power project under the agreement shall be deposited to provide cover for the shortfall in power bill recoveries from the date of power generation of the said projects agreements subject to the condition that the additional direct and indirect expenses incurred in maintaining the revolving account would be compensated by the producers through a discount arrangement to be mutually agreed.’ Subsequently, the Finance Division, in consultation with the Power Division, finalized a mechanism for the Revolving Account (RA) with the approval of The Minister of Finance in a letter date June 22, 2015. Then, in September 2017, the Power Division forwarded a draft Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) to be signed between Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guaranteed (CPPA-G) and power producer(s) to the Finance Division. CPPA-G subsequently executed the finalized draft of RAA with multiple CPEC IPPs. The Government of Pakistan also guaranteed the funding obligations of the CPPA with respect to the RAA, through Supplemental Implementation Agreements signed between the Government of Pakistan — through the Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) — and the respective IPPs.","# Sector

CPHGC was granted a generation license by Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) on September 8, 2016. The term of the license is 30 years from the date of the commencement of commercial operations. CPHGC also submitted an application for an upfront tariff determination with NEPRA, which was approved on February 12, 2016. Then, on January 25, 2017, the Implementation Agreement (IA) and Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) were signed.   The purpose of the project is to construct 2×660 MW coal fired units and a dedicated jetty terminal to import coal at Hub, Mouza Kund, Tehsil Gadani, Lasbela District, and Balochistan Province. Northwest Electric Power Design Institute Co. Ltd. (NWEPDI) and Tianjin Electric Power Construction Company Limited are the EPC contractors responsible for project design and implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on March 21, 2017, and on April 10, 2018, CPHGC entered into Operation and Maintenance (O&M) contract with a consortium that consists of CEEC Tianjin (Pakistan) Electric Power Construction (Private) Limited, China Energy Engineering Group, Tianjin Electric Power Construction Company Limited, and China Energy Engineering Group Science and Technology Development Company Limited to provide operation and maintenance service for the coal-fired electric power generation plant. The project reached its commercial operation date (COD) on August 17, 2019. Its originally expected commercial operation date was August 31, 2018. It is expected that this power plant will provide 9 billion kWh electricity to Pakistan’s national grid each year, thereby meeting the electricity needs of 4 million Pakistani households.   However, this project has encountered a number of revenue generation, debt repayment, and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. The Government of Pakistan fell behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to CPHGC. Total payment arrears, as of May 2022, amounted to PKR 71.6 billion (approximately $379,480,000), which reportedly brought the power plant to the brink of closure and CPHGC to the brink of default. It also became more difficult for CPHGC to source the coal needed to power the plant (due to the inability of a supplier to provide coal from Afghanistan and skyrocketing international coal prices). Then, in July 2022, CPHGC) revealed that the country’s central bank — the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) — had stopped making various payments relating to coal suppliers due to the limited availability of foreign exchange in the country, which resulted in a major accumulation of payment arrears. In a letter dated July 20, 2022, the CEO of CPHGC, Ren Lihui, wrote to Pakistan’s Secretary of Power and warned that ‘any further delay in […] payments [from the State Bank of Pakistan] can adversely affect the ability of CPHGC to operate smoothly.’ He also warned that ‘If the Government of Pakistan fails to fulfill its responsibilities or does not respond in a timely manner, any loss, damages or [liquidated damages] should be borne by the Government of Pakistan.’   Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this '[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Then, in March 2023, CPHGC warned that it was at risk of defaulting on its loan repayment obligations due to overdue power purchase payments from the Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guaranteed (CPPA-G).","1.

Then, in September 2017, the Power Division forwarded a draft Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) to be signed between Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guaranteed (CPPA-G) and power producer(s) to the Finance Division. CPPA-G subsequently executed the finalized draft of RAA with multiple CPEC IPPs. The Government of Pakistan also guaranteed the funding obligations of the CPPA with respect to the RAA, through Supplemental Implementation Agreements signed between the Government of Pakistan — through the Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) — and the respective IPPs.","# Sector

Ltd. (CPHGC) signed a $1,496,000,000 syndicated loan agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned banks — including China Development Bank (CDB, lead arranger), the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank, co-lead arranger), the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Construction Bank Corporation (CCB), and Bank of Communications Co. Limited (BOCOM) — for the 2×660MW Imported Coal Based Independent Power Generation Project at Hub. According to CPHGC's upfront tariff application to Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority, the estimated borrowing terms of the syndicated loan are as follows: a maturity period of 14 years, a grace period of 4 years, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 450 basis points (4.5%). The borrower purchased buyer's credit insurance from Sinosure. As sources of collateral, the borrower also pledged shareholdings, assets, accounts, electricity payment receivables, and its Sinosure insurance policy.   CDB's contribution is captured via Project ID#52423. China Eximbank's contribution is captured via Project ID#92387. ICBC's contribution is captured via Project ID#92388. CCB's contribution is captured via Project ID#92390. BOCOM's contribution is captured via Project ID#92391. The total cost of this independent power project (IPP) was $1.995 billion and it was financed according to a 75:25 debt-to-equity ratio.   CPHGC is a project company and joint venture of China Power International Holding Ltd (CPIH) and the Hub Power Company Limited (HUBCO) that was established to finance, design, and implement this 1320 MW imported coal based power project. CPIH has a 74% ownership stake and HUBCO has a 26% ownership stake in CPHGC. CPHGC was granted a generation license by Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) on September 8, 2016. The term of the license is 30 years from the date of the commencement of commercial operations. CPHGC also submitted an application for an upfront tariff determination with NEPRA, which was approved on February 12, 2016. Then, on January 25, 2017, the Implementation Agreement (IA) and Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) were signed.   The purpose of the project is to construct 2×660 MW coal fired units and a dedicated jetty terminal to import coal at Hub, Mouza Kund, Tehsil Gadani, Lasbela District, and Balochistan Province. Northwest Electric Power Design Institute Co. Ltd. (NWEPDI) and Tianjin Electric Power Construction Company Limited are the EPC contractors responsible for project design and implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on March 21, 2017, and on April 10, 2018, CPHGC entered into Operation and Maintenance (O&M) contract with a consortium that consists of CEEC Tianjin (Pakistan) Electric Power Construction (Private) Limited, China Energy Engineering Group, Tianjin Electric Power Construction Company Limited, and China Energy Engineering Group Science and Technology Development Company Limited to provide operation and maintenance service for the coal-fired electric power generation plant. The project reached its commercial operation date (COD) on August 17, 2019. Its originally expected commercial operation date was August 31, 2018. It is expected that this power plant will provide 9 billion kWh electricity to Pakistan’s national grid each year, thereby meeting the electricity needs of 4 million Pakistani households.   However, this project has encountered a number of revenue generation, debt repayment, and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. The Government of Pakistan fell behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to CPHGC. Total payment arrears, as of May 2022, amounted to PKR 71.6 billion (approximately $379,480,000), which reportedly brought the power plant to the brink of closure and CPHGC to the brink of default. It also became more difficult for CPHGC to source the coal needed to power the plant (due to the inability of a supplier to provide coal from Afghanistan and skyrocketing international coal prices). Then, in July 2022, CPHGC) revealed that the country’s central bank — the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) — had stopped making various payments relating to coal suppliers due to the limited availability of foreign exchange in the country, which resulted in a major accumulation of payment arrears. In a letter dated July 20, 2022, the CEO of CPHGC, Ren Lihui, wrote to Pakistan’s Secretary of Power and warned that ‘any further delay in […] payments [from the State Bank of Pakistan] can adversely affect the ability of CPHGC to operate smoothly.’ He also warned that ‘If the Government of Pakistan fails to fulfill its responsibilities or does not respond in a timely manner, any loss, damages or [liquidated damages] should be borne by the Government of Pakistan.’   Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period.

On November 8, 2014, the Chinese Government and the Government of Pakistan signed a CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement. According to Article 5 of the Agreement, ‘the Pakistani Party agrees that a revolving account shall be opened with 30 days of commercial operation of the respective project, into which the money, no less than the 22 per cent of the monthly payments for the respective power project under the agreement shall be deposited to provide cover for the shortfall in power bill recoveries from the date of power generation of the said projects agreements subject to the condition that the additional direct and indirect expenses incurred in maintaining the revolving account would be compensated by the producers through a discount arrangement to be mutually agreed.’ Subsequently, the Finance Division, in consultation with the Power Division, finalized a mechanism for the Revolving Account (RA) with the approval of The Minister of Finance in a letter date June 22, 2015. Then, in September 2017, the Power Division forwarded a draft Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) to be signed between Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guaranteed (CPPA-G) and power producer(s) to the Finance Division. CPPA-G subsequently executed the finalized draft of RAA with multiple CPEC IPPs. The Government of Pakistan also guaranteed the funding obligations of the CPPA with respect to the RAA, through Supplemental Implementation Agreements signed between the Government of Pakistan — through the Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) — and the respective IPPs.","# Sector
