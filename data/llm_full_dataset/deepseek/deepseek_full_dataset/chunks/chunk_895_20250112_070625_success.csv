The IDB identified the total anticipated project cost as $90.6 million, and noted that the Government of Ecuador was expected to provide $10.6 million of counterpart financing. This was the second project aimed at improving the National Distribution System (SND) with co-financing from the IDB’s ordinary capital and the CHC (see Project ID#85317).   The IDB approval date for this loan financing was June 24, 2015, and it refers to this project as ‘EC-L1147 : Program to Strengthen the National Electricity Distribution System of Ecuador II’.

The project has several objectives, including (1) with the vast majority of the financing, the expansion and reinforcement of electrical grid infrastructure, (2) improvement of the efficiency and reliability of the SND, and, (3) with a small percentage of the financing, strengthening local electricity companies by developing training strategies and conducting courses for personnel. Infrastructure improvement included steps such as connecting SND lines and feeders, rehabilitating electrical substations, and reinforcing feeder lines, among others.
