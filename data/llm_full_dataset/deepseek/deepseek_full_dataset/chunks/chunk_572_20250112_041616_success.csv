This project aims to leverage information and communication technology to reduce the digital deficit and make Senegal a sub-regional hub in West Africa, particularly in the areas of security, education, health, and tourism. The Smart Senegal Project consists of five major sub-projects: (1) Safe City: This sub-project aims to strengthen public security through the use of technological tools and processes for the collection, analysis of flows, events from various communication systems and dissemination of information; (2) Smart Education: This sub-project project aims on the one hand to modernize network, processing, and data storage infrastructures and on the other hand to deploy technological platforms to improve teaching and learning in universities, schools elementary, middle and high schools in Senegal. (3) Smart Territories: This sub-project aims to provide user-centered services (citizens, administrations, and businesses) by building a citizen’s house (“La Maison du Citoyen”) in all the country's departments; (4) Submarine Cable: The purpose of this sub-project is to land a submarine cable in Senegal allowing access to international bandwidth. This new device will increase Senegal's internet capacity and vary the Internet access offer for ISPs; and (5) Smart Wifi: The Smart Wifi sub-project project aims to fight against the digital isolation of territories by increasing the number of digital access points.

The announcement comes on the heels of another agreement signed between Huawei and the African Telecommunications Union (a specialized agency of the African Union), which stipulates that the Chinese company will engage at multiple levels of ICT integration and transformation with AU member states.
