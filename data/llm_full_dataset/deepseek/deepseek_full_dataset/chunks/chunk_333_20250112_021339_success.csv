The Government of Bangladesh’s Executive Committee of the National Economic Council then approved the project on December 6, 2016. On August 11, 2017, the Chinese Government reportedly agreed in principle to finance the project.    Then, on July 4, 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed an RMB 2,630,000,000 ($381,160,000) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2018) 30 TOTAL NO. (672)] and a $1,021,775,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2018) 24 TOTAL NO. (481)] for the Expansion and Strengthening of Power System Network under DPDC Area Project.    The GCL carries an interest rate of 2%, a maturity of 20 years, a grace period of 5 years, and a commitment fee (service charge) of 0.2%. The PBC carries an interest rate of 3%, a maturity of 20 years, a grace period of 5 years, and a commitment fee (service charge) of 0.2%. Project ID#69151 captures the GCL and Project ID#52758 captures the PBC. The proceeds of the PBC and the GCL are to be used by the borrower to finance a $1,657,510,800 commercial contract between TBEA Co., Ltd. and DPDC, which was signed on October 14, 2016. According to the Government of Bangladesh’s Economic Relations Division (ERD), the GCL had achieved a disbursement rate of 55.2% (RMB 1,452,037,000 out of RMB 2,630,000,000) as of June 30, 2020 and 59.5% (RMB 1,565,767,000 out of RMB 2,630,000,000) as of June 30, 2021, but the PBC had still not disbursed as of June 30, 2021. The borrower had not made any repayments under the GCL or PBC as of June 30, 2021.    The project involves the construction of 14 132/33 KV substations, 26 33/11 KV substations, automation systems, mechanized warehouses, 653 km underground cable of 132 kv and 700 km 33 KV distribution lines. The substations, which include the 33/11 KV substation at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) among others, will be built in Dhaka and Narayanganj. The proceeds of the loan will also be used to construct a twin tower in the Hatirpool area and a 20-story building in Hatirjheel for the state-owned Dhaka Power Distribution Company Limited (DPDC).    Tebian Electric Apparatus (TBEA) Co. Ltd is the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation.  However, China National Technical Import & Export Corporation (CNTIC) and Sichuan Electric Power Transmission and Transformation Construction Ltd. (SPTTC) are also involved in the project (most likely as subcontractors). The COVID-19 pandemic led to major delays (as Chinese engineers and workers could not travel from China to the project site) and project implementation did not formally commence until June 19, 2021. Then, on October 31, 2021, a 33/11 KV substation at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) was officially inaugurated and put into use. Two months later, in January 2022, the Dhaka Power Distribution Company (DPDC) opened its first-ever underground switchgear load connection point — or ring main unit (RMU) — at the Bangladesh Agriculture Research Council (Barc). An RMU is a factory-assembled, metal-enclosed set of switchgear used at the load connection points in an electrical power distribution system. The RMUs being installed through the project will reportedly be used to supply electricity to the nearby areas through 11kv underground cables from the 33/11kv substation at Monipuripara. Existing overhead electric cables from Bangabhaban to Jahangir Gate and from Gabtoli to Azimpur will also reportedly be taken underground through the project. In the first phase of the project, 22 RMUs, 19 LTDB and 4 Kiosk transporters are being set up in the Jahangir Gate-Faramgate area to take the overhead cables underground. According to Bikash Dewan, Managing Director of the DPDC, upon completion, the project will ensure more uninterrupted power supply to the installations on both sides of the main road from Jahangir Gate to Farmgate.","1.

China Eximbank contributed $461 million to the loan syndicate (captured via Project ID#52763) and ICBC contributed $400 million to the loan syndicate (captured via Project ID#92382). The loan reportedly carried a 4% interest rate, but its maturity length and grace period are unknown. The project sponsors (CSI, Sinohydro Corporation Ltd., and ITD) issued loan repayment guarantees in proportion to their ownership stakes in FDEE (e.g. Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. guaranteed 15% of the $861 million loan). The proceeds of the loan are to be used by the borrower to partially finance a commercial (EPC) contract between Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA) and China National Import and Export Corporation, which was signed on November 30, 2017. The $1.263 billion project is a public-private partnership (PPP) that is being implemented on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis and financed according to a debt-equity ratio of 65:35.   On April 2, 2020, the first loan disbursement (worth RMB 390 million) was made. By June 2023, the loan had achieved a 39.9% disbursement rate ($343.9 million out of $861 million).  The purpose of the project is the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of a four-lane Elevated Expressway that will commence at Shahjalal International Airport and run alongside New Airport Road, with the rail alignment through the Mohakhali, Tejgaon, and Moghbazar to Kamalapur Railway-station and then the alignment crossing over Jatrabari before connecting to Dhaka Chittagong Highway. The scope of works includes the construction of culverts, toll plazas, underpass and overpass, lay byes, wayside amenities; installation of a computerized toll collection system, providing adequate lights and development of service areas with all required facilities. The total length of the Dhaka Elevated Expressway (also known as the Dhaka-Ashulia Elevated Expressway) is approximately 46.73 km. The construction of the expressway has been divided into three phases – first phase is 7.45km from Kawla (airport) to Banani; second phase is 5.85km from Banani Rail Gate to Moghbazar and third phase is 6.43km from Moghbazar to Kutubkhali. To ease traffic inside the capital, the 19.73km-long main elevated mainline of the expressway will have 31 connecting ramps with a combined length of 27km.   China National Import and Export Corporation is the contractor responsible for implementation. On April 1, 2018, Bangladesh Bridge Authority issued the ‘Construction Commencement Date Notification’, which was considered authorization to begin implementation. However, construction did not begin until January 1, 2020 and the first loan disbursement was not made until April 2, 2020. Project implementation activities were temporarily suspended in mid-2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but work resumed on September 7, 2020. The project achieved an overall completion rate 30.5% by September 2021, with the first phase at a 66.25% completion rate, the second phase at a 21.5% completion rate, and the third phase at a 2.33% completion rate.

The purpose of the project is the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of a four-lane Elevated Expressway that will commence at Shahjalal International Airport and run alongside New Airport Road, with the rail alignment through the Mohakhali, Tejgaon, and Moghbazar to Kamalapur Railway-station and then the alignment crossing over Jatrabari before connecting to Dhaka Chittagong Highway. The scope of works includes the construction of culverts, toll plazas, underpass and overpass, lay byes, wayside amenities; installation of a computerized toll collection system, providing adequate lights and development of service areas with all required facilities. The total length of the Dhaka Elevated Expressway (also known as the Dhaka-Ashulia Elevated Expressway) is approximately 46.73 km. The construction of the expressway has been divided into three phases – first phase is 7.45km from Kawla (airport) to Banani; second phase is 5.85km from Banani Rail Gate to Moghbazar and third phase is 6.43km from Moghbazar to Kutubkhali. To ease traffic inside the capital, the 19.73km-long main elevated mainline of the expressway will have 31 connecting ramps with a combined length of 27km.   China National Import and Export Corporation is the contractor responsible for implementation. On April 1, 2018, Bangladesh Bridge Authority issued the ‘Construction Commencement Date Notification’, which was considered authorization to begin implementation. However, construction did not begin until January 1, 2020 and the first loan disbursement was not made until April 2, 2020. Project implementation activities were temporarily suspended in mid-2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but work resumed on September 7, 2020. The project achieved an overall completion rate 30.5% by September 2021, with the first phase at a 66.25% completion rate, the second phase at a 21.5% completion rate, and the third phase at a 2.33% completion rate.   The project was originally expected to reach completion in July 2023. The expected completion date was later pushed back to June 2024. Once completed, 80,000 vehicles are expected to use the overhead road each day.",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,General Infrastructure,Project is focused on transportation infrastructure without clear environmental or energy transition impacts,"Construction of elevated expressway with toll plazas, underpasses, and service areas; no mention of renewable energy or energy efficiency components"

The proceeds of the PBC and the GCL are to be used by the borrower to finance a $1,657,510,800 commercial contract between TBEA Co., Ltd. and DPDC, which was signed on October 14, 2016. According to the Government of Bangladesh’s Economic Relations Division (ERD), the GCL had achieved a disbursement rate of 55.2% (RMB 1,452,037,000 out of RMB 2,630,000,000) as of June 30, 2020 and 59.5% (RMB 1,565,767,000 out of RMB 2,630,000,000) as of June 30, 2021, but the PBC had still not disbursed as of June 30, 2021. The borrower had not made any repayments under the GCL or PBC as of June 30, 2021.   The project involves the construction of 14 132/33 KV substations, 26 33/11 KV substations, automation systems, mechanized warehouses, 653 km underground cable of 132 kv and 700 km 33 KV distribution lines. The substations, which include the 33/11 KV substation at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) among others, will be built in Dhaka and Narayanganj.
