89411,BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES,BCRA makes RMB 14.2 billion drawdown under currency swap agreement with PBOC in 2014,"On April 2009, the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (Banco Central de la República Argentina, or BCRA) and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) signed an RMB 70 billion ($11 billion) bilateral currency swap agreement to facilitate trade and improve foreign currency liquidity in Argentina. The agreement was extended for an additional three years in July 2014.   BCRA made (gross) drawdowns under the currency swap agreement equivalent to approximately RMB 14.2 billon between October 2014 and December 2014 — through an RMB 5.2 billion ($814 million) drawdown on October 30, 2014, and RMB 3 billion ($507 million) drawdown on November 17, 2014, and an RMB 6 billion ($1.14 billion) drawdown in December 2014. These borrowings carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 4% margin (400 basis points) and a 1-year maturity length.   BCRA also made (gross) drawdowns under the currency swap agreement equivalent to approximately RMB 70 billion — including but not limited to an RMB 2.5 billion ($400 million) drawdown in early January 2015, an RMB 2.5 billion ($400 million) drawdown in late January 2015, and a $1.5 billion drawdown in March 2015. These borrowings also carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 4% margin (400 basis points) and a 1-year maturity length.   Then, on December 16, 2015, BCRA and PBOC signed a supplementary agreement, authorizing (a) the conversion of the RMB that BCRA receives from PBOC in exchange for Argentine pesos (ARS) into any currency (including U.S. dollars) and (b) the use of such funds to service foreign debt obligations. These concessions from PBOC were valuable to BCRA because the Government of Argentina was having difficulty borrowing dollars on international markets after defaulting on its debt in July 2014.   During calendar year 2016, BCRA made (gross) drawdowns under its currency swap agreement with the PBOC equivalent to approximately RMB 70 billion. Then, on July 18, 2017, BCRA and PBOC extended their RMB 70 billion (ARS 175 billion) bilateral currency swap agreement by an additional three years.   During calendar year 2017, BCRA made (gross) drawdowns under its currency swap agreement with the PBOC equivalent to approximately RMB 70 billion.   Then, in 2018, BCRA and PBOC amended the July 18, 2017 agreement to increase the size of the currency swap from RMB 70 billion to RMB 130 billion (approximately $19 billion) — roughly equivalent to one-third of the BCRA’s foreign reserve assets. The 2018 agreement also specified that the PBOC could reject currency swap drawdowns by the BCRA if the Government of Argentina’s IMF standby agreement was suspended or cancelled.   During calendar year 2018, BCRA made (gross) drawdowns under its expanded currency swap agreement with the PBOC equivalent to approximately RMB 130 billion — including but not limited to an RMB 60 billion ($8.7 billion) drawdown on December 17, 2018. These borrowings carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 4% margin (400 basis points) and a 1-year maturity length.   During calendar year 2019, BCRA made (gross) drawdowns under its expanded currency swap agreement with the PBOC equivalent to approximately RMB 130 billion. These borrowings carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 4% margin (400 basis points) and a 1-year maturity length. The 70 billion currency swap agreement was extended for an additional 3 years on July 17, 2020 and the RMB 60 billion currency swap agreement was extended for an additional 3 years on September 17, 2020.   During calendar year 2020, BCRA made (gross) drawdowns under its expanded currency swap agreement with the PBOC equivalent to approximately RMB 130 billion. These borrowings carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 4% margin (400 basis points) and a 3-month maturity length.   BCRA also made (gross) drawdowns under its expanded currency swap agreement with the PBOC equivalent to approximately RMB 130 billion during calendar year 2021. These borrowings carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 4% margin (400 basis points) and a 3-month maturity length. As of December 2021, total PBOC swap debt (RMB 130 billion or $20.4 billion) represented 51% of the BCRA’s foreign currency reserves.   The BCRA’s 2014 drawdowns are captured via Project ID#89411. Its 2015 drawdowns are captured via Project ID#89414. Its 2016 drawdowns are captured via Project ID#95682. Its 2017 drawdowns are captured via Project ID#95912. Its 2018 drawdowns are captured via Project ID#89416. Its 2019 drawdowns are captured via Project ID#96263. Its 2020 drawdowns are captured via Project ID#96264. Its 2021 drawdowns are captured via Project ID#96322.  According to the BCRA, the total (principal) amount outstanding under the PBOC currency swap facility was RMB 14.2 billion ($2,320,635,000) in 2014, RMB 70 billion ($10,783,360,000) in 2015, RMB 70 billion ($10,072,230,000) in 2016, RMB 70 billion ($10,750,040,000) in 2017, RMB 130 billion ($18,969,730,000) in 2018, RMB 130 billion ($18,605,990,000) in 2019, RMB 130 billion ($19,893,250,000) in 2020, and RMB 130 billion ($20,406,880,000) in 2021.","1. A bilateral currency swap (BCS) agreement — also known as a central bank liquidity swap agreement — is an agreement between the central banks of two countries to exchange cash flows in different currencies at predetermined rates over a specified period of time. Central banks participate in these agreements to facilitate bilateral trade settlements using their national currencies (rather than relying upon a third-party currency such as the U.S. dollar), manage demands from their local banks, and provide liquidity support to financial markets. The party that draws down on the swap line becomes the borrower and the other party becomes lender. During the term of the swap, the party that draws down on the swap line makes either fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amount. If both parties draw down on the swap line, then both parties exchange fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amounts. The 5-step process of drawing upon a currency swap line with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) can described from the perspective of an importer in a given country (‘Country X’) seeking to settle trade with a Chinese firm in RMB. Step 1: The central bank of Country X and the PBOC activate their currency swap in advance, at which point each party deposits a specific amount of its currency in an account controlled by the other party (i.e. the central bank of Country X deposits local currency in an account controlled by the PBOC, and the PBOC deposits an equivalent amount in RMB in an account controlled by the central bank of Country X). Step 2: A firm in Country X that imports goods from China applies for an RMB-denominated loan from a domestic bank. Step 3: The domestic bank in Country X that receives the loan application then applies to its central bank for an RMB-denominated loan. After a review process, the central bank of Country X notifies the domestic bank applicant that its loan application was approved. The central bank of Country X subsequently requests that the PBOC transfer RMB funds from the central bank of Country X’s swap account within the PBOC to the loan applicant’s account with a corresponding bank in China. Step 4: The domestic bank in Country X directs the corresponding bank in China to transfer RMB funds into a Chinese exporter’s account, and the corresponding bank in China provides RMB funds to the Chinese exporter. Step 5: The importer in Country X repays the RMB-denominated loan at its maturity date. The domestic bank notifies the central bank of Country X of the repayment, and transfers RMB into the central bank’s account within the PBOC through the corresponding bank in China. For the central bank of Country X, the RMB deposit is an asset that should be recorded on its balance sheet as an official reserve asset denominated in RMB. The contra entry of this asset is the liability in the local currency of Country X that represents China’s claims in the central bank of Country X. This should be also recorded on the balance sheet of the central bank of Country X. At the time of the exchange of currencies, it should be recorded as an increase in assets and an increase in liabilities of the monetary authorities in the balance of payments. The reason why the PBOC uses this mechanism to provide renminbi liquidity to other central bank is to increase the speed, convenience, and volume of transactions between the two countries. More detailed information about currency swaps with the PBOC can be found at https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021210-print-pdf.ashx and https://thechinaguys.com/the-rise-of-the-renminbi-the-reality-of-bilateral-swap-agreements/ and https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2017/pdf/17-25a.pdf.2. AidData treats drawdowns under BCS agreements with the PBOC as collateralized loans because, in a BCS arrangement, the currency of the borrower is held as collateral while the lender receives interest on the amount drawn down by the borrower until repayment is made.3. AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate by adding 4% to the average 6-month SHIBOR rate (4.86%) in 2014.4. Multiple sources indicate that BCRA fully utilized the RMB 70 billion ($11 billion) bilateral currency swap with the PBOC in 2014 and 2015. According to IMF Country Report No. 16/346, “[a]s of end-August [2016], gross reserves were US$31.2 billion amounting to 5.4 months of import cover or 71 percent of the IMF’s reserve adequacy metric. A large part of the reserves (US$11 billion) is from a renminbi swap line with China.” El Cronista, a local media outlet in Argentina, reports (see https://www.cronista.com/finanzas-mercados/Renueva-hoy-el-Banco-Central-el-primer-tramo-del-swap-con-China-20151030-0037.html) that the RMB 70 billion was fully exhausted by BCRA by September 2015, which implies that RMB 55.8 billion was drawn down in calendar year 2015 (since RMB 14.2 billion was drawn down in 2014).5. According to the IMF Country Report No. 16/69, “the government negotiated and activated a renminbi swap line with the People’s Bank of China, drawing a total of US$4.6 billion as of late April 2015.” The same report says that the Government borrowed $2.4 billion from the PBOC in 2014, which implies that $2.2 billion was borrowed between January 2015 and April 2015.6. According to IMF Country Report No. 18/374, “[o]n December 17, [2018] gross reserves increased by US$8.7bn, reflecting the activation of the augmented BCRA swap with the People’s Bank of China. The augmentation, which was signed during the recent G20, brings the total amount of freely available resources under the swap to US$18.7 billion. Gross international reserves moved up to US$58.6 billion.”7. For evidence that the BCRA can convert the RMB it receives from PBOC into U.S. dollars (USD), see pg. 9 of the BCRA's 2015 financial statements. See https://www.dropbox.com/s/13bbay8z0psekx3/i2015financialstatements.pdf?dl=08. The December 16, 2015 supplementary agreement can be accessed in its entirety via https://www.dropbox.com/s/lm13xl9qwxcdl5c/Supplementary%20Agreement%20regarding%20the%20Bilateral%20Currency%20Swap%20Agreement%20Between%20PBOC%20and%20BCRA.pdf?dl=0.9. Most central banks publish their end-of-year outstanding PBOC swap debt, but only a few report detailed transaction-level data on drawdowns during the year. Therefore, if no information on drawings is available, AidData assumes that total drawdowns during the reporting period equal the amount outstanding at the end of the reporting period (and vice versa). Since the (de jure) maturities of PBOC swap drawings are 12 months or less, this creates a lower bound estimate for actual drawdowns under the PBOC swap line. 10. PBOC swap debt is frequently rolled over. In central bank reports where one can only observe the year-end outstanding amount, no distinction between rollovers and drawdowns is possible. In these cases, one can derive (new) drawdowns as the difference between the current and last year’s outstanding swap debt stock. This measure essentially captures net lending through the PBOC swap line.","# Sector

BCRA made (gross) drawdowns under the currency swap agreement equivalent to approximately RMB 14.2 billon between October 2014 and December 2014 — through an RMB 5.2 billion ($814 million) drawdown on October 30, 2014, and RMB 3 billion ($507 million) drawdown on November 17, 2014, and an RMB 6 billion ($1.14 billion) drawdown in December 2014. These borrowings carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 4% margin (400 basis points) and a 1-year maturity length.   BCRA also made (gross) drawdowns under the currency swap agreement equivalent to approximately RMB 70 billion — including but not limited to an RMB 2.5 billion ($400 million) drawdown in early January 2015, an RMB 2.5 billion ($400 million) drawdown in late January 2015, and a $1.5 billion drawdown in March 2015.

The 2018 agreement also specified that the PBOC could reject currency swap drawdowns by the BCRA if the Government of Argentina’s IMF standby agreement was suspended or cancelled.   During calendar year 2018, BCRA made (gross) drawdowns under its expanded currency swap agreement with the PBOC equivalent to approximately RMB 130 billion — including but not limited to an RMB 60 billion ($8.7 billion) drawdown on December 17, 2018. These borrowings carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 4% margin (400 basis points) and a 1-year maturity length.   During calendar year 2019, BCRA made (gross) drawdowns under its expanded currency swap agreement with the PBOC equivalent to approximately RMB 130 billion.

However, it was not until 2007 that then President of Argentina Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (in office from 2007 to 2015) revived plans for the construction of the two dams under the names Kirchner and Cepernic as a tribute to former president Néstor Kirchner (also her late husband) and Jorge Cepernic, a former governor of Santa Cruz Province. The tendering process for the project drew criticism for its lack of transparency. Four entities participated in the public tender for this project. The so-called Unión Transitoria de Empresas (UTE) consortium — also known as the Represas Patagonia consortium — submitted the third-highest of the four bids, but was then allowed to make a second, discounted offer, thus reducing its bid to the lowest, in a move that was widely criticized as ‘irregular.’   On August 1, 2014, Argentina’s Ministry of Economy and Public Finance signed a $4,714,350,000 syndicated term facility (loan) agreement with Bank of China, China Development Bank, and ICBC for the 1,740 MW Néstor Kichner and Jorge Cepernic Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project. The loan agreement was later amended on January 27, 2015 and again in mid-2022. CDB, ICBC, and Bank of China contributed $2,498,605,500, $1,414,305,000, and $801,439,500, respectively, to the syndicated loan. Project ID#59724 captures BOC’s contribution, while Project ID#37002 captures CDB’s contribution and Project ID#59723 captures ICBC’s contribution.   The syndicated term facility agreement carried the following borrowing terms: a 15.5 year maturity, a 5.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus an 3.8% margin, a default (penalty) interest rate of 1.5%, a commitment fee of 0.125%, and an upfront (one-time) management fee of 0.20%. As a credit enhancement, the borrower purchased a buyer’s credit insurance policy from Sinosure worth approximately 7.1% of the face value of the loan ($502,976,000). This measure was demanded by CDB as a condition of disbursement. The syndicated loan agreement also included a cross-default clause, which stated that if the borrower canceled the project, CDB financing for the Belgrano Cargas railway line project (captured via Project ID#36517) with the Government of Argentina would also be canceled. The borrower was expected to use the loan proceeds to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $5,559,610,000 commercial contract between the Government of Argentina’s Ministry of Energy and the Unión Transitoria de Empresas (UTE) Consortium (established by China Gezhouba Group Company Limited, Electroingeniería S.A. and Hidrocuyo S.A.), which was signed on October 31, 2013 and amended on August 20, 2013, January 29, 2014, July 10, 2014, February 9, 2015, August 31, 2016, January 20, 2017, May 31, 2017, February 1, 2018, September 4, 2020 and December 15, 2020.    The loan had achieved a 20.1% disbursement rate ($950,000,000 out of $4,714,350,000) as of November 2015, a 28.6% disbursement rate ($1,350,000,000 out of $4,714,350,000) as of May 2022, a 39.2% disbursement rate as of December 2022 ($1,849,000,000 out of $4,714,350,000), and a 49.8% disbursement rate of June 2022 ($2,349,000,000 out of $4,714,350,000). The loan was originally scheduled for repayment in 20 semi-annual installments between July 2020 and January 2030, with the first repayment date (July 28, 2020) falling 66 months after the financial closing date (January 28, 2015) and the final maturity date falling 180 months after the financial closing date (January 28, 2030). The loan's (principal) amount outstanding was $850,000,000 as of December 31, 2015, $1,350,000,000 as of December 31, 2017, $1,350,000,000 as of December 31, 2019, and $1,282,500,000 as of December 31, 2020. As of 2022, the borrower had paid the Sinosure insurance premium in full.   The original purpose of the project was to construct two hydroelectric power plants (with 11 turbines) — the Néstor Kirchner hydroelectric power plant (also known as Cóndor Cliff power plant) and the Jorge Cepernic hydroelectric power plant (also known as La Barrancosa power plant) — with a capacity of 1,740 MW on the Santa Cruz River in the town of Puerto Santa Cruz. However, the total power generation capacity of the two hydroelectric power plants was later reduced from 1,740 MW to 1,310 MW as part of a rescoping exercise. The Néstor Kirchner hydroelectric power plant will be a 950 MW, 70-meter-high hydropower dam, 130 kilometers to the east of the town of El Calafate in Argentina’s Santa Cruz Province. The Jorge Cepernic hydroelectric power plant, which is located 170 kilometers from the city of Comandante Luis Piedrabuena in Santa Cruz Province, will be 45 meters high with an installed capacity of 360 MW. The locational coordinates of these power plants are 50°12′41.67″S 70°46′30.29″W and 50°11′31.76″S 70°7′14.64″W, respectively.  Upon completion, the power plants are expected to flood more than 47,000 hectares of land. The project also involves the construction of a 500KV extra high voltage transmission line (Línea de Extra Alta Tensión) from Santa Cruz to Buenos Aires measuring 173 kilometers in length and 5 transformer substations for the purpose of connecting the Néstor Carlos Kirchner and Gobernador Jorge Cepernic Hydropower Project to the national electricity grid (known as Sistema Argentino de Interconexion Eléctrica).  Upon completion, the Néstor Kichner and Jorge Cepernic Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project is expected to result in average annual power generation of 4,950 gigawatt-hours, which would mean that Argentina’s installed power capacity would increase by approximately 6.5 percent and its installed hydroelectric power capacity would increase by approximately 15 percent. The project is also expected, upon completion to meet the daily power consumption needs of 1.5 million households. It was additionally envisaged that the project would employ 5,000 people during construction.   The UTE consortium is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. The EPC contractor was authorized by the Government of Argentina to commence construction on February 15, 2015 and the project was originally expected to reach completion within 5 years (February 15, 2020). However, the equipment necessary for the construction of the hydroelectric power plants did not arrive at the project site until July 29, 2015. In October 2015, the Argentine Association of Environmental Lawyers of Patagonia and the Forest Bank Foundation (Fundación Banco de Bosques) initiated legal action, denouncing the project’s lack of a proper environmental impact assessment (EIA) and public consultation process. Then, in November 2015, newly elected Argentine President Mauricio Macri announced his intention to suspend construction of the Kirchner-Cepernic dams. On December 28, 2015, Argentina’s Ministry of Energy issued a stop-work order to the EPC contractor. The Kirchner-Cepernic dams are located on the Santa Cruz River near the famous Perito Moreno Glacier (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) that feeds from the same river, and the Macri administration considered these dams to be too risky on environmental grounds. When President Macri first announced suspension of the project, CDB, ICBC, and Bank of China had already disbursed $950 million under the syndicated term facility agreement. Then, on March 10, 2016, CDB sent a letter to Argentina's Finance Minister, Alfonso Prat Gay, asking for clarification on the future of the project. The letter said: ‘[t]he Kirchner-Cepernic dams and the Belgrano Cargas are major projects promoted by the Chinese Communist Party and signed during the same political time period in Argentina and each one of the payment facility agreements of the dams together with those of the Belgrano Cargas project contain cross default clauses.’   On December 21, 2016, the Supreme Court of Argentina suspended construction of the dams until the EIA process and a public hearing required under Argentina’s Environmental Impact Law of Hydraulic Works (Law 23,879, which sets out a detailed EIA procedure) was conducted. The suspension was also based on the grounds that the dams could destroy archaeological sites and have a negative impact on the Perito Moreno Glacier within Los Glaciares National Park—a top tourist spot in Argentina and one of South America’s largest bodies of ice.    During the second half of 2017, the Kirchner-Cepernic dam projects were rescoped (to include a reduction in power generation capacity from 1,740 MW to 1,310 MW, the incorporation of a high voltage transmission line from Santa Cruz to Buenos Aires, and a longer period of implementation for the rescheduled works) and adapted to the findings of the EIA resulting from a public hearing held by Congress, as mandated by the Supreme Court. On October 10, 2017, Argentina’s Ministry of Energy issued a letter to the EPC contractor, authorizing it to resume project implementation. Approximately 3 weeks later, on October 31, 2017, an Argentinian state-owned corporation (sociedad anónima) known as Integración Energética Argentina S.A. (IEASA) -- formerly Energía Argentina S.A. (""ENARSA"") -- was appointed as the project owner in place of Argentina’s Ministry of Energy and an announcement was made that the Kirchner-Cepernic dams would return to their original names (Cóndor Cliff and La Barrancosa). Dam construction resumed in March 2018. Then, on September 5, 2018, IEASA was formally identified as the project owner in the commercial contract with the UTE Consortium. As of December 2, 2018, the project had undertaken the excavation, earthwork, and filling phases of construction. Then, on August 30, 2019, the project owner (IEASA) and an Argentinian state-owned corporation (sociedad anónima) known as Compañía Administradora del Mercado Mayorista Eléctrico S.A. (CAMMESA) signed a power purchase agreement (PPA), with IEASA serving as the seller and CAMMESA serving as the buyer.  However, between late 2018 and 2021, CDB, Bank of China, and ICBC reportedly halted loan disbursements due to the fact that the Government of Argentina fell behind on the payment of invoices (interim payment certificates). Consequently, the EPC contractor (the UTE consortium) had to contract a $300 million loan from China Gezhouba Group Company Limited in August 2022 (as captured via Project ID#95335) and a $40 million loan from ICBC Argentina in August 2022 (as captured via Project ID#95364). On June 15, 2021, approximately 18 months after Alberto Fernández assumed the Presidency of Argentina and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (the former President of Argentina) assumed the Vice Presidency of Argentina, an announcement was made that the names of the Cóndor Cliff and La Barrancos dams would be changed back to the Néstor Kirchner and Jorge Cepernic dams.   As of August 2021, the project had still only made limited progress: the Néstor Kirchner hydroelectric dam (also known as Cóndor Cliff dam) had achieved a 19.3% completion rate, the Jorge Cepernic hydroelectric dam (also known as La Barrancosa Dam) had achieved a 27.1% completion rate, and the high voltage transmission line had achieved a 6.5% completion rate. By May 2022, the project as a whole had only achieved a 28.64% completion rate, and the Jorge Cepernic hydroelectric dam (also known as La Barrancosa Dam) was expected to be put into commercial operation by the end of 2024 while the Néstor Kirchner hydroelectric dam (also known as Cóndor Cliff dam) was expected to be put into commercial operation by the end of 2027.   On May 26, 2022, Argentina's legislature authorized the Minister of Economy to sign an amended version of the syndicated loan agreement (ID# IF-2022-07542376-APN-SSRFID#SAE) with Bank of China, ICBC, and CDB. Based on modifications to the October 31, 2013 commercial contract (via Addenda Nos. III to IX) with the UTE consortium, the lenders and borrower determined that it was necessary to amend to loan agreement to (a) identify a new project owner (IEASA), (b) document the reduction in power generation capacity (from 1,740 MW to 1,310 MW) due to a rescoping of the project design, (c) modify the semi-annual repayment scheme, and (d) extend the loan availability period by 30 additional months (from July 27, 2020 until January 27, 2023).   Construction activities recommenced during the second half of 2022 -- with support from a $280 million bridge loan from Argentina's National Treasury -- and the first of the eight turbines arrived (by ship at the Santa Cruz port of Punta Quilla) for installation on December 7, 2022. CDB, BOC, and ICBC did not release additional loan disbursements until Argentina's President Alberto Fernández met with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, at the G20 summit in Bali in mid-November 2022.  CDB, BOC, and ICBC reportedly made two loan disbursements in December 2022: one worth $212 million and another worth $287 million (to reimburse the Argentine National Treasury for the cash advance/bridge loan). Then, in June 2023, they made another loan disbursement worth $500 million.   The 1,740 MW Nestor Kichner and Jorge Cepernic Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project has become a major source of controversy and protest. In July 2017, a public hearing was held at the National Congress, in which nongovernmental organizations warned of the deep deficiencies and technical and informational omissions in the project’s original EIA presented by Emprendimientos Energéticos Binacionales S.A. (EBISA). They argued that EBISA lacked the necessary independence and suitability for this type of study because its former president, engineer Jorge Marcolini, was also an official of the ministry that had to evaluate the EIA. In addition, EBISA was not authorized to carry out analysis of the environmental risks of the work because it was not registered in the Registry of Environmental Impact Consultants of the Ministry of the Environment at the time of publication of the EIA. Also, the EIA lacked crucial information, and state technical organizations such as the Argentine Institute of Nivology, Glaciology and Environmental Sciences and the National Institute of Seismic Prevention did not have enough time to go over all the details and implications before the EIA was finalized. These shortcomings became evident in November 2019 when landslides were detected on the banks of the Santa Cruz River at the site where the Cóndor Cliff (Néstor Kirchner) Dam was to be built. Calculation and analysis errors in the construction of the Cóndor Cliff Dam caused a 20-meter crack in one of the landfill containment slopes beside the Santa Cruz River, which forced a redesign of the project and generated an additional outlay of $250 million—that is, about 5% of the total value of the project. In mid-2021, the problem worsened and it was confirmed the crack was by then at least 70 meters long. The EPC contractor built retaining walls to stop its advance, although various groups complain this is only a temporary solution.   Many potential social impacts in the area remain unaddressed. While the project does not require people to be resettled, the construction will impact 14 indigenous communities in Santa Cruz, especially the Comunidad Mapuche Tehuelche de Lof Fem Mapu living in Puerto Santa Cruz, within the area of the project. For these communities the river is a fundamental social space, and the project will impact their burial grounds and community dynamics. In addition, the works are being undertaken with no free, prior, and informed consent—a right acknowledged by the International Labour Organization Convention No. 169, which Argentina has ratified, and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). In August 2017, the Lof Fem Mapu community filed an appeal against the national and provincial governments and against the company over the lack of free, prior, and informed consent. On October 30, 2017, a federal judge ruled in favour of the community, ordering the state to set up a dialogue. Between March 2018 and November 2019, six dialogues were held. In the final dialogue, an intercultural cooperation agreement was signed, allowing the presence of indigenous intercultural technicians at the construction sites. The companies and financiers involved, as well as the Chinese state, have not responded to concerns and complaints made by civil society organizations. These include a letter dated May 20, 2020 addressed to the Minister for Commerce of the People’s Republic of China and the Director of China’s State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission signed by 73 civil society organizations from Argentina, Peru, and Ecuador. The letter raised concern about the project and demanded immediate action—in particular, insisting on the suspension of construction until a free, prior, and informed consultation process with affected indigenous communities was conducted, and a comprehensive EIA was undertaken that includes environmental and social impacts. The letter also raised issues related to Covid-19, asking the Chinese Government to exclude these controversial projects from receiving possible pandemic-related financial support.   At peak level of construction, the project created over 5,000 jobs directly and 15,000 jobs indirectly.  During the Covid-19 pandemic, there were reports of violations of labour and health rights of the workers employed on the project, particularly in terms of overcrowded conditions, lack of epidemiological control, lack of testing, and insufficient sanitation. In early 2020, workers complained they had not been given any health or safety guarantees and quarantine measures were not complied with. Due to a Covid-19 outbreak in late October 2020, public health authorities ordered the total closure of the Cóndor Cliff site for three weeks.","1.

# Title
China Development Bank contributes $2.49 billion to $4.71 billion syndicated loan for 1,310 MW Nestor Kichner and Jorge Cepernic Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#59723, #59724,  #95335, #95374, and #95364)

# Description
The initial plans for the Cóndor Cliff and La Barrancosa hydroelectric complex were conceived in the 1950s and a series of preliminary studies was carried out before 1980. However, it was not until 2007 that then President of Argentina Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (in office from 2007 to 2015) revived plans for the construction of the two dams under the names Kirchner and Cepernic as a tribute to former president Néstor Kirchner (also her late husband) and Jorge Cepernic, a former governor of Santa Cruz Province. The tendering process for the project drew criticism for its lack of transparency. Four entities participated in the public tender for this project. The so-called Unión Transitoria de Empresas (UTE) consortium — also known as the Represas Patagonia consortium — submitted the third-highest of the four bids, but was then allowed to make a second, discounted offer, thus reducing its bid to the lowest, in a move that was widely criticized as ‘irregular.’   On August 1, 2014, Argentina’s Ministry of Economy and Public Finance signed a $4,714,350,000 syndicated term facility (loan) agreement with Bank of China, China Development Bank, and ICBC for the 1,740 MW Néstor Kichner and Jorge Cepernic Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project. The loan agreement was later amended on January 27, 2015 and again in mid-2022. CDB, ICBC, and Bank of China contributed $2,498,605,500, $1,414,305,000, and $801,439,500, respectively, to the syndicated loan. Project ID#59724 captures BOC’s contribution, while Project ID#37002 captures CDB’s contribution and Project ID#59723 captures ICBC’s contribution.   The syndicated term facility agreement carried the following borrowing terms: a 15.5 year maturity, a 5.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus an 3.8% margin, a default (penalty) interest rate of 1.5%, a commitment fee of 0.125%, and an upfront (one-time) management fee of 0.20%. As a credit enhancement, the borrower purchased a buyer’s credit insurance policy from Sinosure worth approximately 7.1% of the face value of the loan ($502,976,000). This measure was demanded by CDB as a condition of disbursement. The syndicated loan agreement also included a cross-default clause, which stated that if the borrower canceled the project, CDB financing for the Belgrano Cargas railway line project (captured via Project ID#36517) with the Government of Argentina would also be canceled. The borrower was expected to use the loan proceeds to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $5,559,610,000 commercial contract between the Government of Argentina’s Ministry of Energy and the Unión Transitoria de Empresas (UTE) Consortium (established by China Gezhouba Group Company Limited, Electroingeniería S.A. and Hidrocuyo S.A.), which was signed on October 31, 2013 and amended on August 20, 2013, January 29, 2014, July 10, 2014, February 9, 2015, August 31, 2016, January 20, 2017, May 31, 2017, February 1, 2018, September 4, 2020 and December 15, 2020.    The loan had achieved a 20.1% disbursement rate ($950,000,000 out of $4,714,350,000) as of November 2015, a 28.6% disbursement rate ($1,350,000,000 out of $4,714,350,000) as of May 2022, a 39.2% disbursement rate as of December 2022 ($1,849,000,000 out of $4,714,350,000), and a 49.8% disbursement rate of June 2022 ($2,349,000,000 out of $4,714,350,000). The loan was originally scheduled for repayment in 20 semi-annual installments between July 2020 and January 2030, with the first repayment date (July 28, 2020) falling 66 months after the financial closing date (January 28, 2015) and the final maturity date falling 180 months after the financial closing date (January 28, 2030). The loan's (principal) amount outstanding was $850,000,000 as of December 31, 2015, $1,350,000,000 as of December 31, 2017, $1,350,000,000 as of December 31, 2019, and $1,282,500,000 as of December 31, 2020. As of 2022, the borrower had paid the Sinosure insurance premium in full.   The original purpose of the project was to construct two hydroelectric power plants (with 11 turbines) — the Néstor Kirchner hydroelectric power plant (also known as Cóndor Cliff power plant) and the Jorge Cepernic hydroelectric power plant (also known as La Barrancosa power plant) — with a capacity of 1,740 MW on the Santa Cruz River in the town of Puerto Santa Cruz. However, the total power generation capacity of the two hydroelectric power plants was later reduced from 1,740 MW to 1,310 MW as part of a rescoping exercise. The Néstor Kirchner hydroelectric power plant will be a 950 MW, 70-meter-high hydropower dam, 130 kilometers to the east of the town of El Calafate in Argentina’s Santa Cruz Province. The Jorge Cepernic hydroelectric power plant, which is located 170 kilometers from the city of Comandante Luis Piedrabuena in Santa Cruz Province, will be 45 meters high with an installed capacity of 360 MW. The locational coordinates of these power plants are 50°12′41.67″S 70°46′30.29″W and 50°11′31.76″S 70°7′14.64″W, respectively.  Upon completion, the power plants are expected to flood more than 47,000 hectares of land. The project also involves the construction of a 500KV extra high voltage transmission line (Línea de Extra Alta Tensión) from Santa Cruz to Buenos Aires measuring 173 kilometers in length and 5 transformer substations for the purpose of connecting the Néstor Carlos Kirchner and Gobernador Jorge Cepernic Hydropower Project to the national electricity grid (known as Sistema Argentino de Interconexion Eléctrica).

During the second half of 2017, the Kirchner-Cepernic dam projects were rescoped (to include a reduction in power generation capacity from 1,740 MW to 1,310 MW, the incorporation of a high voltage transmission line from Santa Cruz to Buenos Aires, and a longer period of implementation for the rescheduled works) and adapted to the findings of the EIA resulting from a public hearing held by Congress, as mandated by the Supreme Court. On October 10, 2017, Argentina’s Ministry of Energy issued a letter to the EPC contractor, authorizing it to resume project implementation. Approximately 3 weeks later, on October 31, 2017, an Argentinian state-owned corporation (sociedad anónima) known as Integración Energética Argentina S.A. (IEASA) -- formerly Energía Argentina S.A. (""ENARSA"") -- was appointed as the project owner in place of Argentina’s Ministry of Energy and an announcement was made that the Kirchner-Cepernic dams would return to their original names (Cóndor Cliff and La Barrancosa). Dam construction resumed in March 2018. Then, on September 5, 2018, IEASA was formally identified as the project owner in the commercial contract with the UTE Consortium. As of December 2, 2018, the project had undertaken the excavation, earthwork, and filling phases of construction. Then, on August 30, 2019, the project owner (IEASA) and an Argentinian state-owned corporation (sociedad anónima) known as Compañía Administradora del Mercado Mayorista Eléctrico S.A. (CAMMESA) signed a power purchase agreement (PPA), with IEASA serving as the seller and CAMMESA serving as the buyer.  However, between late 2018 and 2021, CDB, Bank of China, and ICBC reportedly halted loan disbursements due to the fact that the Government of Argentina fell behind on the payment of invoices (interim payment certificates). Consequently, the EPC contractor (the UTE consortium) had to contract a $300 million loan from China Gezhouba Group Company Limited in August 2022 (as captured via Project ID#95335) and a $40 million loan from ICBC Argentina in August 2022 (as captured via Project ID#95364). On June 15, 2021, approximately 18 months after Alberto Fernández assumed the Presidency of Argentina and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (the former President of Argentina) assumed the Vice Presidency of Argentina, an announcement was made that the names of the Cóndor Cliff and La Barrancos dams would be changed back to the Néstor Kirchner and Jorge Cepernic dams.   As of August 2021, the project had still only made limited progress: the Néstor Kirchner hydroelectric dam (also known as Cóndor Cliff dam) had achieved a 19.3% completion rate, the Jorge Cepernic hydroelectric dam (also known as La Barrancosa Dam) had achieved a 27.1% completion rate, and the high voltage transmission line had achieved a 6.5% completion rate. By May 2022, the project as a whole had only achieved a 28.64% completion rate, and the Jorge Cepernic hydroelectric dam (also known as La Barrancosa Dam) was expected to be put into commercial operation by the end of 2024 while the Néstor Kirchner hydroelectric dam (also known as Cóndor Cliff dam) was expected to be put into commercial operation by the end of 2027.   On May 26, 2022, Argentina's legislature authorized the Minister of Economy to sign an amended version of the syndicated loan agreement (ID# IF-2022-07542376-APN-SSRFID#SAE) with Bank of China, ICBC, and CDB. Based on modifications to the October 31, 2013 commercial contract (via Addenda Nos. III to IX) with the UTE consortium, the lenders and borrower determined that it was necessary to amend to loan agreement to (a) identify a new project owner (IEASA), (b) document the reduction in power generation capacity (from 1,740 MW to 1,310 MW) due to a rescoping of the project design, (c) modify the semi-annual repayment scheme, and (d) extend the loan availability period by 30 additional months (from July 27, 2020 until January 27, 2023).   Construction activities recommenced during the second half of 2022 -- with support from a $280 million bridge loan from Argentina's National Treasury -- and the first of the eight turbines arrived (by ship at the Santa Cruz port of Punta Quilla) for installation on December 7, 2022. CDB, BOC, and ICBC did not release additional loan disbursements until Argentina's President Alberto Fernández met with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, at the G20 summit in Bali in mid-November 2022.  CDB, BOC, and ICBC reportedly made two loan disbursements in December 2022: one worth $212 million and another worth $287 million (to reimburse the Argentine National Treasury for the cash advance/bridge loan). Then, in June 2023, they made another loan disbursement worth $500 million.   The 1,740 MW Nestor Kichner and Jorge Cepernic Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project has become a major source of controversy and protest. In July 2017, a public hearing was held at the National Congress, in which nongovernmental organizations warned of the deep deficiencies and technical and informational omissions in the project’s original EIA presented by Emprendimientos Energéticos Binacionales S.A. (EBISA). They argued that EBISA lacked the necessary independence and suitability for this type of study because its former president, engineer Jorge Marcolini, was also an official of the ministry that had to evaluate the EIA. In addition, EBISA was not authorized to carry out analysis of the environmental risks of the work because it was not registered in the Registry of Environmental Impact Consultants of the Ministry of the Environment at the time of publication of the EIA. Also, the EIA lacked crucial information, and state technical organizations such as the Argentine Institute of Nivology, Glaciology and Environmental Sciences and the National Institute of Seismic Prevention did not have enough time to go over all the details and implications before the EIA was finalized. These shortcomings became evident in November 2019 when landslides were detected on the banks of the Santa Cruz River at the site where the Cóndor Cliff (Néstor Kirchner) Dam was to be built. Calculation and analysis errors in the construction of the Cóndor Cliff Dam caused a 20-meter crack in one of the landfill containment slopes beside the Santa Cruz River, which forced a redesign of the project and generated an additional outlay of $250 million—that is, about 5% of the total value of the project. In mid-2021, the problem worsened and it was confirmed the crack was by then at least 70 meters long. The EPC contractor built retaining walls to stop its advance, although various groups complain this is only a temporary solution.   Many potential social impacts in the area remain unaddressed. While the project does not require people to be resettled, the construction will impact 14 indigenous communities in Santa Cruz, especially the Comunidad Mapuche Tehuelche de Lof Fem Mapu living in Puerto Santa Cruz, within the area of the project. For these communities the river is a fundamental social space, and the project will impact their burial grounds and community dynamics. In addition, the works are being undertaken with no free, prior, and informed consent—a right acknowledged by the International Labour Organization Convention No. 169, which Argentina has ratified, and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). In August 2017, the Lof Fem Mapu community filed an appeal against the national and provincial governments and against the company over the lack of free, prior, and informed consent. On October 30, 2017, a federal judge ruled in favour of the community, ordering the state to set up a dialogue. Between March 2018 and November 2019, six dialogues were held. In the final dialogue, an intercultural cooperation agreement was signed, allowing the presence of indigenous intercultural technicians at the construction sites. The companies and financiers involved, as well as the Chinese state, have not responded to concerns and complaints made by civil society organizations. These include a letter dated May 20, 2020 addressed to the Minister for Commerce of the People’s Republic of China and the Director of China’s State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission signed by 73 civil society organizations from Argentina, Peru, and Ecuador. The letter raised concern about the project and demanded immediate action—in particular, insisting on the suspension of construction until a free, prior, and informed consultation process with affected indigenous communities was conducted, and a comprehensive EIA was undertaken that includes environmental and social impacts. The letter also raised issues related to Covid-19, asking the Chinese Government to exclude these controversial projects from receiving possible pandemic-related financial support.   At peak level of construction, the project created over 5,000 jobs directly and 15,000 jobs indirectly.  During the Covid-19 pandemic, there were reports of violations of labour and health rights of the workers employed on the project, particularly in terms of overcrowded conditions, lack of epidemiological control, lack of testing, and insufficient sanitation. In early 2020, workers complained they had not been given any health or safety guarantees and quarantine measures were not complied with. Due to a Covid-19 outbreak in late October 2020, public health authorities ordered the total closure of the Cóndor Cliff site for three weeks.",TRUE,NA,GREEN,HIGH,Hydropower,"Primary purpose is hydroelectric power generation, a renewable energy source, despite environmental and social concerns","Construction of two hydroelectric power plants with 1,310 MW capacity, expected to generate 4,950 GWh annually, increasing Argentina's hydroelectric capacity by 15%"
