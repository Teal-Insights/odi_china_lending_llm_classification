Neither of the China Eximbank loans that supported this project are included in the Overseas Development Finance Dataset that Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center published in December 2020.3. In 2001, a joint venture called Janfull International Dateline Hotel Ltd. was established to manage the International Dateline Hotel in Tonga. It was jointly owned by Janfull Group (51% ownership stake) and International Dateline Hotel Ltd. (49% ownership stake). Janfull Group was owned by China’s Ministry of Commerce and International Dateline Hotel Ltd. was owned by the Government of Tonga. This joint venture is captured in Project ID#42192. In August 2010, the Government of Tonga announced its intent to dissolve the joint venture, citing differences with Janfull Group (a Chinese state-owned enterprise). At the time, the hotel was performing ‘well below international standards’, according to an ADB report. In June 2011, Tonga’s Minister of Public Enterprises successfully applied to have the joint venture placed into liquidation by a court. This move was designed to allow the Government of Tonga to regain control of the hotel—once it had proven its loan to the liquidator’s satisfaction—and then seek private investment or ownership to reestablish the hotel as a high-quality accommodation facility. The Government of Tonga purchased Janfull Group’s 51% ownership stake in Janfull International Dateline Hotel Ltd. after settling unpaid debts (worth $11 million) to China Eximbank. The Government of Tonga then asked the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to served as a transaction advisor and structure, and competitively tender and award a project for the rehabilitation and operation of the International Dateline Hotel on a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) basis. After longer-than-anticipated negotiations, a long-term management concession agreement was signed with an international hotel operator – Tanoa Group – who completely redeveloped the hotel. As of late 2016, the hotel reopened. There have been no further costs to the Government of Tonga since the concession agreement was signed; the hotel is now the largest in Tonga, and a high-quality (4.5 star) hotel. Occupancy rates were estimated at 39% in April 2017.4. The concessional loan for Phase 1 was likely denominated in RMB. However, AidData has only managed to identify the USD equivalent of the face value of the loan. This issue requires further investigation.5. China Foreign Construction Corporation, Guangsha Chongqing Construction (Group) Co., Ltd., China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), Jiangsu Construction Group Corp., Hunan Construction Engineering Group Corporation, China National Overseas Engineering Corporation, Qingdao Construction Group Corporation were all invited to tender, but CCECC won the contract for Phase 2.6.

One official source indicates that the China Eximbank loan was issued on December 17, 2001, which suggests that the August 16, 2001 loan agreement may have been revised. Some official sources also suggest that the loan's maturity date was March 21, 2032, which again suggests a revision to the August 16, 2001 loan agreement. 3.  AidData has set the umbrella field to False since no specific subsidiary projects were identified but six specific loan disbursements were identified.4. According to the World Bank's Debtor Reporting System (DRS), the Government of Turkmenistan borrowed $19,469,740.10 in 2001 from official sector lenders in China. The weighted average borrowing terms recorded in the DRS include a 3.379% interest rate, a 4.5141 year grace period, and a 12.8757 year maturity. This suggests that more than one official sector Chinese loan was provided to the Government of Turkmenistan in 2001. However, at present, AidData only captures a single loan (Project ID#40165). This issue warrants further investigation.
