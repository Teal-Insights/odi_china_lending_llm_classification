Evidence also emerged of overpricing, as the contractor's unit cost of laying a kilometer of fiber optic cable in South Sudan was $124,455.

This project is also known as the National Broadband and Informationization Network Project. The Chinese project title is 南苏丹国家宽带网络项目.2.  There is a chance that this project was financed through an export sellers’ credit to Huawei, which it in turn used to provide vendor financing to MTN Sudan (or MTN South Sudan). This issue warrants further investigation. MTN acknowledges in its 2014 bond prospectus that 'we have made substantial equipment purchases from, and have entered into vendor financing arrangements with, Ericsson, Huawei and ZTE in certain jurisdictions.' In the same bond prospectus, MTN discloses that one of its subsidiaries -- MTN Sudan Company Limited -- received USD- and euro-denominated vendor financing. However, AidData has not yet independently confirmed that China Eximbank provided an export seller's credit to Huawei which it then on-lent to MTN for its activities in South Sudan.
