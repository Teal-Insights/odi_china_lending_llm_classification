Regarding the USD loan utilized, GLRE was responsible for making equal principal repayments of $2,350,000 every three months for five years from the first utilization date (June 8, 2020).  The syndicated facility was secured by (i.e. collateralized against): 1. charges over certain of the Group’s property, plant, and equipment with a total carrying amount of $1,517,000 (2020: $1,502,000) as of December 31, 2021; 2. charges over shares in the Company’s subsidiaries; 3. charges over certain of the Group’s investment properties and development properties with carrying amount of $74,741,000 (2020: $78,966,000) and $50,937,000 (2020: $51,252,000), respectively, as of December 31, 2021; 4. charges over certain of the Group’s cash and bank balances of $1,173,000 (2020: $713,000) (Note 9); 5. charges over certain of the Group’s trade receivables of $192,000 (2020: $nil); and 6. corporate guarantees by the Company.  There are indications that the loan that was issued for the Golden City Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lenders. GLRE made a partial principal repayment of $1,000,000 for March 2021 and negotiated temporary relief through the revision of the repayment schedule. The next principal repayment of $4,130,000 was scheduled on March 8, 2023, to be made every three months until June 8, 2025.   Under the terms of the syndicated facility, GLRE was required to comply with certain financial covenants for the duration of the loan.

In addition, GLRE did not make payment for a facility fee that was due.

(GLRE) -- a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that is legally incorporated in Myanmar and 49% owned by Emerging Towns & Cities Singapore Ltd. -- for the Golden City Project. The loan consisted of three tranches: a $45,000,000 tranche (as captured via Project ID#96663), a $2,000,000 tranche (as captured via Project ID#96664), and an MMK 4,500,000,000 (as captured via Project ID#96665). Participants in the loan syndicate included the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (Yangon Branch) (“ICBC”), E.SUN Commercial Bank, Ltd (Yangon Branch) (“Esun”) and Kanbawza Bank (Yangon) (“KBZ”).

It comprises 40 residential units, 1 retail unit, and 27 office units over a 70-tenure. The address is No. 3, Land Survey Block, Kanbe, Yankin Road, Yankin Township, Yangon, Myanmar.
