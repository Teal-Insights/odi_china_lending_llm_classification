49343,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides RMB 644.4 million government concessional loan for Supply of 13 Diesel Multiple Units for Sri Lanka Railways Project,"On March 5, 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed an RMB 700 million government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [ID#1290003032010110253] for the Supply of 13 Diesel Multiple Units for Sri Lanka Railways Project. The face value of the GCL was subsequently downsized to RMB 644,443,837. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0.5% commitment fee, and a 0.5% management fee. This first disbursement through this loan took place in 2010 and the last disbursement took place in 2014. China Eximbank disbursed RMB 201,269,677.71 (Rs. 3,386,040,296) in 2010, RMB 0 in 2011, RMB 177,586,994.32 (Rs. 3,678,278,808) in 2012, RMB 264,429,640.10 in 2013, and RMB 254,895,013.03 (Rs. 5,405,023,262) in 2014. The loan had achieved a 139.3% disbursement rate (RMB 898,181,325.16 out of RMB 644,443,837) as of December 31, 2014.   The borrower made repayments worth RMB 42,962,922 in 2018, RMB 42,962,922 in 2019, RMB 42,962,922 in 2020 and RMB 42,962,922 in 2021. The loan's amount outstanding was RMB 537,036,531 as of December 31, 2017, RMB 494,073,609 as of December 31, 2018, RMB 451,110,687 as of December 31, 2019, RMB 408,147,765 as of December 31, 2020, RMB 365,184,843 as of December 31, 2021, and RMB 343,703,380 as of June 30, 2022.   The loan that was issued for this project has encountered repayment problems. On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a ‘pre-emptive’ sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. Its decision to suspend external debt service reportedly affected all China Eximbank loans with amounts outstanding at the time of the announcement.   The purpose of the project was to facilitate the procurement of thirteen, Class S12 Diesel Multiple Units (DMUs) for Sri Lanka Railways, and thereby strengthen the passenger transport service of Sri Lanka Railways by adding 13 DMUs to its fleet of rolling stock. Seven of the S12 DMUs were ordered to strengthen long-distance travel on the Main Line from Colombo to Badulla. The steep slopes on the up-country portion of the Main Line make it difficult to operate. Prior to the S12 DMUs, only a few models of locomotives were capable of operating this line. Four of the S12 DMUs were ordered to serve the Kelani Valley Line. Two of the S12 DMUs were ordered to be used for tourist transportation. The thirteen S12 DMUs were scheduled for delivery in four batch by September 2012. CRRC Sifang — a wholly-owned subsidiary of China South Locomotive and Rolling Stock Industry (Group) Corporation — was the contractor responsible for delivery of the DMUs.  The first batch of DMUs arrived in Sri Lanka in August 2012. The first Main Line train using a S12 DMU began on October 23, 2012. This project is now complete, but the exact dates of delivery of the second, third, and fourth batches are unknown.   This project facilitated the acquisition of Diesel Multiple Units for use on the Main (Railway) Line from Colombo to Badulla and the Kelani Valley Line. The Main Line starts from Colombo and runs east and north past the rapidly developing centres of Ragama, Gampaha, Veyangoda, and Polgahawela. At Rambukkana, the Main Line begins its steep climb into the hills of the upcountry. Between Balana and Kadugannawa, the track clings to the side of sheer cliffs, offering passengers views of Batalegala ('Bible' Rock). From Peradeniya Junction, a branch line reaches Kandy and Matale. The Main Line then continues its climb through tea country, connecting local market centres at Gampola, Nawalapitiya, and Hatton before reaching Nanu Oya. The Main Line continues its ascent to the summit at Pattipola, 1,898 m (6,227 ft) above sea level, before descending past Bandarawela to Badulla. The Kelani Valley line runs southeast from Colombo Maradana Station, through much of the city of Colombo. It runs through major business centres, like Nugegoda and Maharagama, before turning eastwards. It crosses the Southern Expressway near Homagama and continues east towards Avissawella, the current terminus of the line. Major railway stations on the line are Colombo Fort, Maradana, Narahenpita, Nugegoda, Maharagama, Pannipitiya, Kottawa, Homagama, Meegoda, Padukka, Waga, Kosgama, and Avissawella.",1. The DMUs are sometimes referred to as ‘power sets’.2. China Eximbank provided a separate loan in 2007 to facilitate the procurement of 15 Diesel Multiple Units (see Project ID#33260). 3.

This resources-credit cooperation package is backed by future revenues from the sale of oil exports. Each subsidiary buyer’s credit loan (BCL) issued through the framework agreement carries a 15-year maturity and 5.6% interest rate.  On April 4, 2010, China Eximbank reportedly agreed in principle to finance a $274 million South Kordofan 220kV Power Transmission and Distribution Project through this non-concessional master framework agreement. However, on October 8, 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Sudan signed a $233 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for this project, which carried a different set of concessional borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity and 3% interest rate. The proceeds from this PBC were used to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $274 million commercial contract between China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC) and the National Electricity Corporation (NEC) of Sudan, which was signed on July 4, 2009.  The project involved the construction of an electricity transmission line than runs from the city of El-Obeid (in central Sudan within North Kordofan State) to a power plant in Al-Fulah (or al-Fula or EI Fula or الفولة) in West Kordofan State. The 405 MW Al-Fulah Gas-Fired Power Plant Construction Project was funded through a separate China Eximbank BCL (as captured via Project ID#1007). The ultimate goal was to supply power to Northern and Southern Kordofan and the western region of Darfur.   This project did reach the implementation phase, but it is unclear whether or when the project was completed.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan issued for the South Kordofan 220kV Power Transmission and Distribution Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis lender expectations. According to Sudan’s Finance Minister Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool, China Eximbank suspended its financing for 11 projects in Sudan following the secession of South Sudan in July 2011, which triggered a major loss of oil revenue (a key source of collateral for China Eximbank loans). Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool said at the time that the Government of Sudan had previously pledged oil revenues (worth 120,000 barrels per day) to China Eximbank as a source of collateral. Then, on February 18, 2012, the Chinese Government announced that it had agreed to reschedule the outstanding debt obligations of the Government of Sudan by extending loan repayment periods by 5 years (as captured via Project ID#30421). According to the External Debt Unit of the Central Bank of Sudan, the Government of Sudan's total arrears to Chinese creditors amounted to $3.864 billion ($2.608 billion in principal, $1.129 billion in interest, and $127 million in penalty interest) as of March 31, 2022.",1.

The project involved the construction of an electricity transmission line than runs from the city of El-Obeid (in central Sudan within North Kordofan State) to a power plant in Al-Fulah (or al-Fula or EI Fula or الفولة) in West Kordofan State. The 405 MW Al-Fulah Gas-Fired Power Plant Construction Project was funded through a separate China Eximbank BCL (as captured via Project ID#1007). The ultimate goal was to supply power to Northern and Southern Kordofan and the western region of Darfur.   This project did reach the implementation phase, but it is unclear whether or when the project was completed.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan issued for the South Kordofan 220kV Power Transmission and Distribution Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis lender expectations. According to Sudan’s Finance Minister Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool, China Eximbank suspended its financing for 11 projects in Sudan following the secession of South Sudan in July 2011, which triggered a major loss of oil revenue (a key source of collateral for China Eximbank loans). Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool said at the time that the Government of Sudan had previously pledged oil revenues (worth 120,000 barrels per day) to China Eximbank as a source of collateral. Then, on February 18, 2012, the Chinese Government announced that it had agreed to reschedule the outstanding debt obligations of the Government of Sudan by extending loan repayment periods by 5 years (as captured via Project ID#30421). According to the External Debt Unit of the Central Bank of Sudan, the Government of Sudan's total arrears to Chinese creditors amounted to $3.864 billion ($2.608 billion in principal, $1.129 billion in interest, and $127 million in penalty interest) as of March 31, 2022.",TRUE,NA,GREY,HIGH,Grid Infrastructure,"The project involves construction of electricity transmission infrastructure, which enables power distribution but does not directly contribute to or hinder energy transition goals","220kV Power Transmission and Distribution Project, connects to gas-fired power plant, aims to supply power to multiple regions"
