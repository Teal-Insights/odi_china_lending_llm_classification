65855,ENERGY,Bank of China participates in EUR 3.765 billion syndicated loan for Trans-Adriatic Gas Pipeline (TAP) Project,"On December 7, 2018, Trans-Atlantic Pipeline (TAP) AG — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and joint venture of BP (20%), State Oil and Gas Company of Azerbaijan (SOCAR) (20%), Snam (20%), Fluxys (19%), Enagás (16%) and Axpo (5%) — signed a €3.765 billion EUR ($4.25 billion USD) debt financing package with a syndicate of 22 lenders, including Bank of China (BOC). In addition to BOC, the lenders included Santander, Caixabank, Crédit Agricole, Intesa San Paolo, KDB, Mizuho, MUFG, Natixis, SMBC, Société Générale, Standard Chartered, UniCredit, BNP Paribas, ING, bpiFrance, EBRD, EIB, Euler Hermes, SACE, Helaba, and UBI Banca.  The debt financing package consisted of four tranches: a €700 million EUR loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB), a €500 million EUR loan from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), a €500 EUR million ‘B loan’ syndicated to 16 commercial banks, and a €2.065 billion EUR loan from BOC, BNP Paribas, Caixa Bank, Crédit Agricole, Helaba, ING, Intesa Sanpaulo, Korea Development Bank, Mizuho, MUFG, Natixis, Siemens Bank, Société Générale, Standard Chartered, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, UBI Banca and UniCredit. These loans reportedly carried 16.6-year maturities. The export credit agencies Bpifrance (€450 million EUR), Euler Hermes (€280 million EUR) and SACE (€700 million EUR) provided lending cover for some of the commercial bank loans.  The Trans-Adriatic Gas Pipeline (TAP) is a gas pipeline running from Greece's border with Turkey to Italy, via Albania and the Adriatic Sea. The route links Europe to a new gas source in the Caspian (Shah Deniz II). The Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) project is the western extension of the Southern Gas Corridor (SGC). SGC exports natural gas – initially 10 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year but with capacity to expand to 20 bcm – from the Shah Deniz II field in the Caspian Sea to western markets via the South Caucasus Pipeline extension (Azerbaijan to Georgia), on through the Trans-Anatolian pipeline (TANAP) stretching across Turkey, and then joining up with TAP at the border of Turkey and Greece. TAP runs for 878 kilometers in total across northern Greece (550 km), Albania (215 km), the Adriatic Sea (105 km), makes landfall in Italy at a small, popular beach in San Foca, and concludes with a short pipeline section (8 km). A further 55 km pipeline, the TAP Interconnection, connects TAP to the Italian gas network.  A joint venture of Bonatti (Italy) and J&P AVAX (Greece) was contracted for the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) of 360 km of the pipeline in segment in Greece. SPIECAPAG (France) was awarded the EPC contract for a 185 km onshore segment in Greece as well as for a 215 km segment in Albania. SPIECAPAG also carried out the pipeline river crossing at the Greek-Turkish border. A joint venture of Renco (Italy) and Terna (Greece) was awarded the EPC contract for the two compressor stations. Renco was also awarded the EPC contract for the pipeline receiving terminal. Siemens was contracted to supply six gas turbine turbo compressor units for the TAP’s compressor stations. A joint venture of Enereco and Max Streicher was contracted for the construction of the 8 km-long onshore segment in Italy. Saipem was awarded the engineering, procurement, construction, and installation (EPCI) contract for the 105km offshore section of the pipeline across the Adriatic Sea. Statoil (now Equinor ASA) prepared the front-end engineering design (FEED) for the offshore section of the pipeline.  Honeywell was contracted for the engineering, procurement, and installation of the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) telecommunications and security systems of the TAP. Corinth Pipeworks was contracted for the supply of approximately 495 km of 48-in diameter line pipes for the project in Greece. Salzgitter Mannesmann International was contracted to supply 297 km of 48in-diameter pipes for the onshore section and 110 km of 36in-diameter pipes for the offshore section. Industria Meccanica Bassi Luigi was contracted for the engineering and supply of 48in and 36in piggable T-pieces, welded elbows, and scraper traps units for the pipeline. Nuova Giungas (Valvitalia Group) was awarded the engineering, manufacturing and delivery contract for 48in and 36in isolating joints of the pipeline. RMA of Germany was contracted to supply of 55 ball valves and actuators for the pipeline. Himachal Futuristic Communications (HFCL), a company based in India, was contracted to supply approximately 1,550 km of fiber optic cable for the project. Other contractors involved in the project were MTC-MAKEDONIKI, ABKons, ENY Law Firm (as a legal advisor), UTG, and INFODIM.   Shipments of steel line pipes, equipment & machinery began arriving in the Albanian port of Durrës in April 2016. Then, on May 17, 2016, a project commencement ceremony has held. During the same month, the first deliveries of steel line pipes and bends for TAP's Greek section arrived at the ports of Thessaloniki and Kavala. By December 2016, 58 km of access roads were upgraded, two new bridges were built, and 40 bridges were refurbished in Albania. Construction of the pipeline was 50% complete as of December 2017. On April 29, 2018, China’s Ministry of Commerce reported that the TAP project had achieved an 86% completion rate. As of October 2019, it had achieved a 91% completion rate. Then, in May 2020, a construction worker died while preparing the construction work for the Snam gas pipeline interconnection between TAP and the Italian gas transportation network in Lecce.  One month later, in June 2020, the TAP consortium announced that construction of the 105 km offshore segment of the pipeline across the Adriatic from Albania to Italy had been completed. By the end of August 2020, the project was reportedly 97.9% complete and TAP AG was confident that it would be able to deliver the first Azerbaijani gas to Italy by October 2020. However, at the same time, TAP AG notified Italy's regulator of the possibility of postponing the first delivery of gas until December 2021, principally due to the potential risk of COVID-19 related construction delays. The project ultimately achieved its commercial operation date (COD) on November 15, 2020. Then, on December 31, 2020, SOCAR and TAP AG announced that Caspian gas transported by TAP had begun flowing into Italy, Greece, and Bulgaria. Italy’s Ministry of Ecological Transition has reported that over 2.5 billion cubic meters of gas have been delivered to date.  This project has become a target of public scrutiny and controversy. Following a complaint lodged by the environmental NGOs CEE Bankwatch Network, Counter Balance, Re:Common and Friends of the Earth Europe, in December 2020, the European Union's Ombudsman opened an investigation into the EIB's financing in 2018 of both TAP and the related Trans-Anatolian Gas Pipeline (TANAP). At issue is why the EIB agreed to provide major loans for both pipelines without appropriate assessment of their climate impact. The EIB's carbon footprint assessment of TAP projected 2.5 times fewer greenhouse gas emissions than the figure in the environmental and social impact assessment which was submitted by the consortium building the pipeline.","1.

52663,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides $2.67 billion preferential buyer's credit for Padma Bridge Rail Link Project (Linked to Project ID#52765),"In January 2015, the Chinese Government proposed loans worth $15 to $20 billion to finance the expansion of various railways in Bangladesh. Soon thereafter, Bangladesh's Ministry of Railways sent a set of projects to the Economic Relations Division (ERD) of Bangladesh's Ministry of Finance to inquire about potential Chinese financing. Then, Bangladesh’s Ministry of Finance sent a list of projects, including the Padma Bridge Rail Project, to the Chinese Government. At that point, Bangladesh's Ministry of Railways had already signed memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with China Railway Group Limited for the Padma Bridge Rail Project. Then, on August 8, 2016, Bangladesh Railway and China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC) signed a $3.13 billion commercial contract for the construction of a 172-kilometer-long railway line from Dhaka to Jessore crossing through the Padma Bridge. Two months later, in October 2016, during the state visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to Bangladesh, the Chinese Government and the Government of Bangladesh signed an MoU on the Padma Bridge Rail Link Project.    However, the project hit a snag because of disagreements between the Chinese Government and the Government of Bangladesh on the face value and interest rate of the proposed loan for the project. The Bangladesh's Ministry of Railways requested that the project begin implementation in January 2017 in order to be completed by the time the Padma Bridge was completed. However, a loan agreement with China Eximbank had yet to be signed and was scheduled to be signed on December 16, 2017. This date came and past, despite attempts of Bangladeshi authorities — including the Prime Minister's Office — to contact their Chinese counterparts to finalize the loan. The Government of Bangladesh had wanted the project to be completed before Bangladesh's December 2018 general elections.    Specific issues relating to the face value of the loan were related to major increases in the cost of land acquisition. China Eximbank disagreed with the Government of Bangladesh over the costs of the land acquisition. As a result, China Eximbank reduced the promised loan amount by 15% (from approximately ৳247.490 billion BDT to ৳210.36 billion BDT) and turned its previously promised ‘soft loan’ (most likely a governmental concessional loan) into a preferential buyer's credit. As a result, the Government of Bangladesh was forced to increase its counterpart funding contribution from ৳102 billion BDT to ৳190.43 billion BDT.    Then, on February 2, 2018, China Eximbank sent a letter to the Government of Bangladesh informing them that it would begin the process of signing the loan agreement. To ensure that China Eximbank would issue the loan for the Padma Bridge Rail Link Project promptly, in early February 2018 (presumably after the China Eximbank letter was received), the Government of Bangladesh approved ‘on an urgent basis’ a China Eximbank government concessional loan worth RMB 1,547,071,939.09 ($231.5 million) for the Modernization of Telecommunication Network for Digital Connectivity Project (MOTN) (captured via Project ID#52765) because the ‘[d]elay in offering the green signal to the Chinese assistance [for the telecommunications modernization project] was affecting the implementation of the [Padma Bridge Rail Link Project].’ The Government of Bangladesh had previous problems with the MOTN loan and delayed approving it, which provoked concerns among the Chinese authorities. To address these concerns and advance the Padma Bridge Rail Link Project, the Government of Bangladesh approved the MOTN loan. Then, China’s State Council provided its approval for China Eximbank to issue a loan for the Padma Bridge Rail Link Project in February 2018. The Chinese Government sent the loan agreement to the Bangladeshi Government by the end of February for final review and countersignature.    Then, on April 27, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed the $2,667,940,000 preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement for the Padma Bridge Rail Link Project (PBRLP). The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 2%, a grace period of 6 years, a maturity period of 20 years, a management fee of 0.25%, and a commitment fee of 0.25%. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $3,138,750,000 commercial contract between the Government of Bangladesh and CREC, which was signed in August 2016. The Government of Bangladesh is responsible for covering the remaining 15% ($470.81 million).    According to the Government of Bangladesh’s Economic Relations Division (ERD), the PBC had achieved a disbursement rate of 20% ($533,588,000 out of $2,667,940,000) as of June 30, 2020 and a 40.4% disbursement rate ($1,079,727,000 out of $2,667,940,000) as of June 30, 2021.  According to the Government of Bangladesh’s ERD, the borrower had not made any repayments under the PBC as of June 30, 2021. The purpose of the project is to construct a new railway track that runs from the city of Dhaka to the city of Jessore via Padma Multipurpose Bridge to establish new Broad Gauge (BG) railway connectivity through south-west part of the country. The project is being implemented in 2 phases. The first phase is an 82 kilometer section from Dhaka to Bhanga, and the second phase is a Bhanga to Jessore section. The project involves the construction of 215.22 km of rail track, including loops and sidings; 23.38 km of viaducts, 1.98 km of ramps, 66 major bridges, 244 minor bridges and culverts, 1 highway overpass, and 29 level crossings. The project also includes the construction of 14 new station buildings, remodeling of 6 existing station buildings, the supply of 100 passenger coaches, and the acquisition of 1796 acres of land. 172 kilometer of track is to be laid between Dhaka to Jessore via Padam Bridge and Bhanga of Faridpur, while 43.2 km of track was set to be lines loop lines. 23 kilometers of the rail line is set to be elevated. The single-track rail line is designed to accommodate a maximum speed of 120 kilometers per hour. Construction of the railway is expected to impact the living accommodations of 7,705 people, necessitating resettlement arrangements.    The PBRLP seeks to establish a rail-based transportation network with nine southern districts including the Port of Mongla and Benapole Land Port through the 6.15-kilometer Padma Bridge (which was still under construction when this project began implementation). The route is to be constructed in four sections: Dhaka-Gendaria, Gendaria-Mawa, Mawa-Bhanga junction via Padma Bridge and Bhanga-Jessore Bridge. The 50-kilometer-long Mawa-Bhanga junction-Bhanga via Padma Bridge section was originally expected to be completed by the end of 2018 to allow trains to travel over the bridge on the day of its inauguration. The project, part of the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor (BCIM) of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), is expected to cut the travel time from Dhaka to Kolkata, West Bengal, India by five hours and time from Dhaka to Khulna in southern Bangladesh from nine hours to 3 hours.  CREC is the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. China Railway First Group Co, Ltd. (CRFG) — a subsidiary of China Railway Group Limited — is also involved in project implementation. The Engineering Corps of Bangladesh Army and Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology have also served as consultants for the project. Bangladesh Railway is the main executing agency on behalf of the Bangladeshi Government, while Bangladesh's Ministry of Railways (MoR) is the ‘sponsoring ministry.’ After the signing of the loan agreement, construction was placed under the supervision of Fast Track Project Monitoring Committee, headed by Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina.    Project implementation commenced on July 3, 2018, with an intended completion date of June 2022. However, even by May 2018, before implementation had commenced, Bangladesh Railways officials were attempting to secure an extension of implementation from June 2022 to June 2024 due to the previously described delays relating to the loan. Prime Minister Hasina officially inaugurated work on the project on October 14, 2018, despite the commencement of construction works several months prior.     By November 2020, the project had achieved a 28.28% completion rate, despite the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The expected project completion date at that time was June 2024, and the Mawa-Bhanga junction-Bhanga via Padma Bridge section was to be set to be open in 2021 (although this section was originally scheduled to be opened by the end of 2018). On August 23, 2021, the installation of all road slabs on Padma Bridge was completed. In total, 2,917 road slabs and 2,959 railway slabs were installed on the 6.15 km-long bridge. As of November 2021, the physical works of the main structure of the Padma Bridge had achieved a 95% completion rate and the overall progress of the bridge construction stood at an 88.75% completion rate.

China Eximbank provides $2.67 billion preferential buyer's credit for Padma Bridge Rail Link Project (Linked to Project ID#52765)

# Description
In January 2015, the Chinese Government proposed loans worth $15 to $20 billion to finance the expansion of various railways in Bangladesh. Soon thereafter, Bangladesh's Ministry of Railways sent a set of projects to the Economic Relations Division (ERD) of Bangladesh's Ministry of Finance to inquire about potential Chinese financing. Then, Bangladesh’s Ministry of Finance sent a list of projects, including the Padma Bridge Rail Project, to the Chinese Government. At that point, Bangladesh's Ministry of Railways had already signed memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with China Railway Group Limited for the Padma Bridge Rail Project. Then, on August 8, 2016, Bangladesh Railway and China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC) signed a $3.13 billion commercial contract for the construction of a 172-kilometer-long railway line from Dhaka to Jessore crossing through the Padma Bridge. Two months later, in October 2016, during the state visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to Bangladesh, the Chinese Government and the Government of Bangladesh signed an MoU on the Padma Bridge Rail Link Project.    However, the project hit a snag because of disagreements between the Chinese Government and the Government of Bangladesh on the face value and interest rate of the proposed loan for the project. The Bangladesh's Ministry of Railways requested that the project begin implementation in January 2017 in order to be completed by the time the Padma Bridge was completed. However, a loan agreement with China Eximbank had yet to be signed and was scheduled to be signed on December 16, 2017. This date came and past, despite attempts of Bangladeshi authorities — including the Prime Minister's Office — to contact their Chinese counterparts to finalize the loan. The Government of Bangladesh had wanted the project to be completed before Bangladesh's December 2018 general elections.    Specific issues relating to the face value of the loan were related to major increases in the cost of land acquisition. China Eximbank disagreed with the Government of Bangladesh over the costs of the land acquisition. As a result, China Eximbank reduced the promised loan amount by 15% (from approximately ৳247.490 billion BDT to ৳210.36 billion BDT) and turned its previously promised ‘soft loan’ (most likely a governmental concessional loan) into a preferential buyer's credit. As a result, the Government of Bangladesh was forced to increase its counterpart funding contribution from ৳102 billion BDT to ৳190.43 billion BDT.    Then, on February 2, 2018, China Eximbank sent a letter to the Government of Bangladesh informing them that it would begin the process of signing the loan agreement. To ensure that China Eximbank would issue the loan for the Padma Bridge Rail Link Project promptly, in early February 2018 (presumably after the China Eximbank letter was received), the Government of Bangladesh approved ‘on an urgent basis’ a China Eximbank government concessional loan worth RMB 1,547,071,939.09 ($231.5 million) for the Modernization of Telecommunication Network for Digital Connectivity Project (MOTN) (captured via Project ID#52765) because the ‘[d]elay in offering the green signal to the Chinese assistance [for the telecommunications modernization project] was affecting the implementation of the [Padma Bridge Rail Link Project].’ The Government of Bangladesh had previous problems with the MOTN loan and delayed approving it, which provoked concerns among the Chinese authorities. To address these concerns and advance the Padma Bridge Rail Link Project, the Government of Bangladesh approved the MOTN loan. Then, China’s State Council provided its approval for China Eximbank to issue a loan for the Padma Bridge Rail Link Project in February 2018. The Chinese Government sent the loan agreement to the Bangladeshi Government by the end of February for final review and countersignature.    Then, on April 27, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed the $2,667,940,000 preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement for the Padma Bridge Rail Link Project (PBRLP). The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 2%, a grace period of 6 years, a maturity period of 20 years, a management fee of 0.25%, and a commitment fee of 0.25%. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $3,138,750,000 commercial contract between the Government of Bangladesh and CREC, which was signed in August 2016. The Government of Bangladesh is responsible for covering the remaining 15% ($470.81 million).    According to the Government of Bangladesh’s Economic Relations Division (ERD), the PBC had achieved a disbursement rate of 20% ($533,588,000 out of $2,667,940,000) as of June 30, 2020 and a 40.4% disbursement rate ($1,079,727,000 out of $2,667,940,000) as of June 30, 2021.  According to the Government of Bangladesh’s ERD, the borrower had not made any repayments under the PBC as of June 30, 2021. The purpose of the project is to construct a new railway track that runs from the city of Dhaka to the city of Jessore via Padma Multipurpose Bridge to establish new Broad Gauge (BG) railway connectivity through south-west part of the country. The project is being implemented in 2 phases. The first phase is an 82 kilometer section from Dhaka to Bhanga, and the second phase is a Bhanga to Jessore section. The project involves the construction of 215.22 km of rail track, including loops and sidings; 23.38 km of viaducts, 1.98 km of ramps, 66 major bridges, 244 minor bridges and culverts, 1 highway overpass, and 29 level crossings. The project also includes the construction of 14 new station buildings, remodeling of 6 existing station buildings, the supply of 100 passenger coaches, and the acquisition of 1796 acres of land. 172 kilometer of track is to be laid between Dhaka to Jessore via Padam Bridge and Bhanga of Faridpur, while 43.2 km of track was set to be lines loop lines. 23 kilometers of the rail line is set to be elevated. The single-track rail line is designed to accommodate a maximum speed of 120 kilometers per hour. Construction of the railway is expected to impact the living accommodations of 7,705 people, necessitating resettlement arrangements.

(NWPGCL) signed a joint venture agreement with China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation (CMC) to construct the first phase of the 1320MW Payra Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant Project. CMC and NWPGCL formed the Bangladesh-China Power Company Ltd. (BCPCL) — a special purpose vehicle — to carry out this project. CMC and NWPGCL each hold a 50% equity stake in BCPCL. The Prime Ministers from both countries attended the June 2014 signing ceremony for the BCPCL. NWPGCL and CMC registered BCPCL on October 1, 2014.    NWPGCL is a subsidiary of the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB). BPDP and CMC are both state-owned companies.   The total cost of the 1320MW Payra Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant is $2.48 billion and it is reportedly being financed according to an 80:20 debt-to-equity ratio. NWPGCL and CMC each reportedly will provide 50% of the equity financing for this project. Project ID#56005 captures the equity funding for the project. China Eximbank covered the remaining 80% of the project through debt financing. On May 12, 2018, the China Eximbank and BCPCL signed a $1.984 billion loan agreement to support the construction of the 1320MW Payra Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant Project (as captured via Project ID#52748). The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 4 year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 2.98% margin. Principal and interest is payable in 23 semi-annual installments. Interest is also payable semi-annually during the grace period. The loan is collateralized in that the 1320MW Payra coal-fired power plant facility has been mortgaged to the lender. The borrower is also required to maintain a minimum cash balance in a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA). As an additional credit enhancement, the Government of Bangladesh issued a $1 billion sovereign guarantee in support of the loan on December 31, 2017.   The borrower made three principal repayments worth $64,946,000 in financial year 2020-2021 (July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021) and $136,333,396 in financial year 2021-2022  (July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022). However, the borrower struggled to meet its repayment obligation during the second half of calendar year 2022.   The borrower failed to pay the fourth (scheduled) installment of principal and interest (worth $114 million) to the lender on December 8, 2022, which raised questions about a possible default and BCPCL's ability to secure a follow-on loan from China Eximbank for the Second Phase of 1320MW Payra Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant Project. AM Khorshedul Alam, Managing Director of BCPCL, told a local media outlet at the time that his organization had the entire month of December 2022 to pay the fourth installment. China Eximbank reportedly issued an invoice amounting to $114 million due on December 8, 2022. But when BCPCL asked its 'account bank' – Sonali Bank – to make the payment, Sonali Bank said it was not in a position to provide such a large amount of US dollars. Following Sonali Bank's reply, the BCPCL wrote a letter to the Secretary of Bangladesh's Power Division on December 1, 2022, requesting its assistance by notifying the Forex Reserve and Treasury Management Department of the country's central bank (Bangladesh Bank) through the Finance Division to provide the required U.S. dollars to the bank account before December 8, 2022 at the Bangladesh Bank rate. 'The Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee of around $1 billion favouring the lender to secure this loan repayment. Failure to pay 4th loan [installment] may result in country default,' reads the letter. BCPCL also noted that '[I]f we failed to pay the loan [installment in a timely manner], loan financing for the 2nd phase of the project may be seriously threatened.' Two weeks earlier, on November 13, 2022, BCPCL wrote to the Forex Reserve and Treasury Management Department of the Bangladesh Bank and the Power Division to request help accessing the U.S. dollars needed to make loan repayments and coal import-related payments. 'The Bangladesh Bank is the only source that has the capability to support our huge forex liquidity requirement, BCPCL wrote in its letter. BCPCL also noted in its November 13, 2022 letter to the Power Division and the Bangladesh Bank that, that apart from the China Eximbank loan installment, it had $94.84 million in overdue coal import bills as of November 2022 (that were being financed through a deferred payment facility with CMC that carries a 3.25% interest rate and 6-month maturity).  The China Eximbank loan's principal amount outstanding was $1,464,465,797 in financial year 2019-2021 (July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020), $1,816,329,544 in financial year 2020-2021 (July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021), and $1,679,996,148 in financial year 2021-2022 (July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022).  The Payra power plant is located in Dhankhali, Patuakhali, Bangladesh. This places the power plant along the north side of the Payra port, which will be renovated by the China Harbour Company and the China State Construction Engineering Corporation (see Project ID#55522). Phase one of the project involves the construction of power generation units one and two. Each unit will have a capacity of 660 MW, so phase one has a combined capacity of 1320 MW. In December 2017, BPDB contracted China Energy Engineering Group Northeast No. 1 Electric Power Construction Co., Ltd. (NPEC) and China National Energy Engineering & Construction Co., Ltd. (CECC) to construct the power plants. The first phase of the project was officially launched on October 27, 2018. The first phase of the power plant became operational on January 13, 2020, achieved its Initial Operation Date (IOD) on May 15, 2020, and achieved its Commercial Operation Date (COD) on December 8, 2020. It began supplying electricity to the national grid, per national load dispatch center (NLDC) demand, after achieving COD.   A consortium led by the China Datang Overseas Electric Technology and O&M Co. Ltd. will carry out operations and maintenance of the power plant. Once operational, this power plant will sell energy to the BPDB at a cost of 6.56 BDT per unit of energy.","1.

Approximately one year later, on September 10, 2017, the Chinese Government and the Government of Bangladesh signed a preferential loan framework agreement in which the Chinese Government agreed in principle to issue an RMB 1,547,071,939.09 ($231.5 million) loan for the Modernization of Telecommunication Network for Digital Connectivity Project (MOTN). However, there were delays in the signing of the formal loan agreement because the Government of Bangladesh and BTCL were concerned with the higher-than-expected cost of the contract with ZTE. BTCL negotiated with ZTE and managed to reduce the cost, which enabled the project to proceed. Then, on April 10, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed an RMB 1,547,071,939.09 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for MOTN Project. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 2%, a maturity period of 21 years, a grace period of 6 years, and a commitment fee (service charge rate) of 0.2%. In addition to the China Eximbank loan, the Government of Bangladesh was expected to contribute ৳7,561,100,000 BDT of counterpart financing for the MOTN project. According to the Government of Bangladesh’s Economic Relations Division (ERD), the GCL had achieved a disbursement rate of 19.9% (RMB 309,414,000 out of RMB 1,547,071,939.09) as of June 30, 2019, 49.8% (RMB 771,139,000 out of RMB 1,547,071,939.09) as of June 30, 2020 and 66.6% (RMB 1,030,397,000 out of RMB 1,547,071,939.09) as of June 30, 2021. No repayments on the GCL had been made as of June 30, 2020 or June 30, 2021.   The purpose of the project is to upgrade the fixed network of BTCL in order to provide a wider, modernized, and cheap range of IP telephony, high-speed Internet, and converged services including video calling and videoconferencing over BTCL’s PSTN access lines, to compete better against mobile alternatives. The MOTN project involves the replacement of BTCL's public switched telephone network system (PSTN) with a IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem)-based telephone system using Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON) technology that would cover all of Bangladesh's districts with the requisite transmission and IP networks. Upon completion, the project is expected to fulfill the Government of Bangladesh's ‘Vision-2021’ plan and help secure a Digital Bangladesh, More specifically, the MOTN project is expected to divide Bangladesh's IMS Core Exchanges into three parts: Dhaka, Chittagong, and Khulna, each with a capacity of 1,600,000 subscribers. It is also expected to replace old IP exchanges with IP-based Exchange Access gateways.   The MOTN project also involves the creation of eight rings in several Bangladeshi districts, including Dhaka and Chittagong, that would allow the transmission backbone to be more reliable. It also includes the installation of a pair of core routers in Chittagong, Dhaka, and Khulna. A national operations center with 21 large monitors capable of monitoring the network will be created by the project. A submarine cable connection through Cox's Baxar and Kuawakata, through India via Benapole, is also supposed to be established to improve the network's resiliency.   Additionally, the project will develop a computerized model using BTCL's existing optical fiber and the MOTN upgrades in order to better monitor the optical fiber network status. ZTE Corporation is the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor responsible for implementation and Bangladesh's Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology is responsible for project supervision. The Government Bangladesh's Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) approved the project on October 17, 2017.   The project was expected to take 3 years to implementation. ZTE reportedly began work in January 2019. However, the project's official commencement ceremony was held on January 8, 2020. The project implementation period was originally expected to take place between July 2017 and June 2020. However, a revised Development Project Proposal (DPP) was sent to Bangladesh's Posts and Telecommunications Division for approval by the ECNEC; the DPP proposed the extension of the project implementation period by an additional two years and an increase in the project cost to ৳33,749,400,000 BDT from ৳25,733,900,000 BDT. The new expected completion time was June 30 2022. On September 15, 2020, the project’s Business Operation and Support System (BOSS) and Network Operation Center (NOC) were launched, which signified that the project was entering a new (commercial use) phase.

# Title
China Eximbank provides RMB 1.547 billion government concessional loan for the Modernization of Telecommunication Network for Digital Connectivity Project (MOTN) (Linked to Project ID#52663)

# Description
On August 24, 2016, the Government of Bangladesh awarded a contract to a Chinese consortium comprised of ZTE Corporation and ZTE Holdings to upgrade the fixed network of Bangladeshi state-owned Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited (BTCL). At that time, the Chinese Government pledged to finance 90% of the total cost of the project. Then, on September 27, 2016, BTCL signed a commercial contract with ZTE Corporation and ZTE Holding Co., Ltd. for the project.
