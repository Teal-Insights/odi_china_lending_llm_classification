Phase 1 involved the rehabilitation of a 218 kilometer segment of National Road 6 (RN6) from the city of Bamako to the city of Ségou. China Road and Bridge Corporation was the contractor responsible for implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on October 25, 2010.

The project was ultimately completed when the road was opened to traffic on January 13, 2015. As a result of this project, travel time from Bamako to Ségou fell from 4 hours to 2 hours.

# Title
China Eximbank provides RMB 1.03 billion government concessional loan for Phase 1 of the Bamako-Ségou Road Rehabilitation Project (Linked to Project ID#58571)

# Description
On September 27, 2010, the Chinese Government and the Government of Mali signed a concessional loan framework agreement for Phase 1 of the Bamako-Ségou Road Rehabilitation Project. Then, on December 30, 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Mali signed an RMB 1,030,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the project. The proceeds from the GCL were used to finance a commercial contract between China Road and Bridge Corporation and Mali’s Ministry of Equipment and Transportation, which was signed on December 2, 2009.   Phase 1 involved the rehabilitation of a 218 kilometer segment of National Road 6 (RN6) from the city of Bamako to the city of Ségou. China Road and Bridge Corporation was the contractor responsible for implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on October 25, 2010. However the project did not officially start until November 18, 2011. The project was temporarily suspended due to a military coup in 2012 and then delayed significantly due to an armed rebellion in Northern Mali in 2013 and the Ebola outbreak of 2014. The project was ultimately completed when the road was opened to traffic on January 13, 2015. As a result of this project, travel time from Bamako to Ségou fell from 4 hours to 2 hours. China Eximbank is also financing Phase 2 of the Bamako-Segou Road Rehabilitation Project (captured in Project ID#58571).",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,General Infrastructure,Road rehabilitation project with no clear environmental or energy transition impacts,"Rehabilitation of 218 km road segment, transportation infrastructure focus"
