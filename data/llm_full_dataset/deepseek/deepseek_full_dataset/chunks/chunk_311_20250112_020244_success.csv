The BCL is also supported by a Sinosure credit insurance policy.  Then, on June 12, 2020. China Eximbank’s Sovereign Business Department issued a letter to the Government of Uganda’s Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development, notifying it that ‘all the conditions as set out in Article 16 of the [BCL] agreement have been satisfied’ and the ‘[BCL] agreement becomes effective on and from the date June 12, 2020.’   The borrower is to use the BCL proceeds to finance 85% of the cost of a $218,888,518.40 commercial (EPC) contract (No. UNRA/WORKS/2016-17/00110/01) between the Uganda National Roads Authority (the ‘project owner’) and China Communications Construction Company Ltd (CCCC), which was signed on February 5, 2018. The borrower and/or the project owner are responsible for paying 15% of the commercial contract amount ($32,833,277.76) with their own funds.

The purpose of the project is to upgrade the 111 km Hoima-Butiaba-Wanseko road from gravel to bituminous standard.  The main objectives of the project are to: (a) improve the road infrastructure within the mineral and oil exploration zones which are in both Hoima and Bulisa districts; (b) improve access to social and economic development opportunities along the route and integration to the rest of the rest of the country by providing high capacity infrastructure; and (c) ensure that no road side communities become worse off as a result of the road upgrading work.  Chongqing International Construction Corporation is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Project implementation commenced on April 16, 2018 and the project was originally expected to reach completion on April 16, 2021. However, the project has encountered various implementation delays. As of December 31, 2020, the project had achieved a 71.96% physical progress rate (against a target of 87.88%). As of November 1, 2021, the project had achieved a 90% physical progress rate.
