42355,ENERGY,China Development Bank provides $189 million buyer’s credit loan for 40MW Vitebsk Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project,"On December 27, 2010, China Development Bank and the Government of Belarus signed a $189 million buyer’s credit loan agreement for the 40MW Vitebsk Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project. The loan has a maturity of 15 years with a 5 year grace period. Its interest rate is unknown. The Government of Belarus issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. BPS-Bank served as the agent bank for loan servicing. The Government of Belarus on-lent the proceeds of the loan to a state-owned company called RUE Vitebskenergo and a state-owned company called Belenergo. RUE Vitebskenergo then used the proceeds of the loan to finance a $230 million commercial contract that it signed with China National Electric Engineering Co (CNEEC) on December 27, 2010.   The purpose of this project was to construct a 40MW hydroelectric power plant (with four 10MW power generation units) in the city of Vitebsk near the Western Dvina River and within the Vitebskaya (Vitebsk) Oblast. Upon completion, it was expected that this plant would meet one-third of the electricity needs of the Vitebsk Oblast.

Then, on March 1, 2016, the installation of hydraulic power equipment began. The power plant began generating electricity on a trial basis (with one of the 10MW power generation units) on December 1, 2016. Then, on December 21, 2016, all four 10MW power generation units were connected to the grid. The power plant was ultimately put into operation on July 31, 2017.","1.

The purpose of the project was to develop and launch the ‘Túpac Katari’ communications satellite. The satellite, which owes its name to an Aymara warrior and activist who fought the Spanish for indigenous independence in the 18th century, weighs 5.3 tons, 2.36 meters long and 2.1 meters wide. Its useful life is 15 years. It consists of 30 channels and operates on three frequencies. The first frequency is used to cover a large part of the Bolivian territory in internet services, the second frequency covers radio and communication broadcasts and the third frequency is planned to rent different types of transmissions to neighboring countries. The main customer of the Túpac Katari satellite services is the state-owned National Telecommunications Company (Entel), and the Government of Bolivia expected that the satellite would generate annual revenues of nearly $40 million for the provision of services to local and international firms.   CGWIC was the contractor responsible for project implementation, which commenced in August 2011. Bolivia's first communications satellite, Tupac Katari (TKSAT-1), was officially launched on December 20, 2013 from the Xinchang satellite launch center. It was launched by the LM-3B/E launch vehicle developed by China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT), and China Satellite Launch & Tracking Control General (CLTC) was responsible for the ground segment.

CDB provides $249.5 million loan for Túpac Katari (TKSAT-1) Communications Satellite (Linked to Project ID#36269 and #36270)

# Description
On December 23, 2010, China Development Bank (CDB) and the Government of Bolivia signed a $251,124,000 loan agreement for the Túpac Katari (TKSAT-1) Communications Satellite Project. The face value of the loan was subsequently downsized to $249,539,000. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 270 basis points, a maturity of 16 years, and a grace period of 3 years.   The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance a commercial contract between the Government of Bolivia and Great Wall Industry Corporation (CGWIC), which was signed on December 13, 2010.  The lender made disbursements worth $120,315,500 between 2010 and 2012, $113,928,000 in 2013, $14,510,500 in 2014, and $785,000 in 2015. The borrower made loan repayments worth $5,601,763 in 2013 ($0 in principal and $5,601,763 in interest/fees), $7,736,731 in 2014 ($0 in principal and $7,736,731 in interest/fees), $28,418,960 in 2015 ($20,795,000 in principal and $7,623,960 in interest/fees), $28,810,793 in 2016 ($20,795,000 in principal and $8,015,793 in interest/fees), $29,127,846 in 2017 ($20,795,000 in principal and $8,332,846 in interest/fees), $29,654,894 in 2018 ($20,795,000 in principal and $8,859,894 in interest/fees), $29,490,694 in 2019 ($20,795,000 in principal and $8,695,694 in interest/fees), an unknown amount in 2020, and $24,305,073 in 2021 ($20,795,000 in principal and $3,510,073 in interest/fees). The loan’s (principal) amount outstanding was $120,315,500 as of December 31, 2012, $234,243,500 as of December 31, 2013, $248,754,000 as of December 31, 2014, $228,744,000 as of December 31, 2015, $207,949,000 as of December 31, 2016, $187,154,000 as of December 31, 2017, $166,359,000 as of December 31, 2018, $145,564,000 as of December 31, 2019, $124,769,000 as of December 31, 2020, and $103,974,000 as of December 31, 2021.   The purpose of the project was to develop and launch the ‘Túpac Katari’ communications satellite. The satellite, which owes its name to an Aymara warrior and activist who fought the Spanish for indigenous independence in the 18th century, weighs 5.3 tons, 2.36 meters long and 2.1 meters wide. Its useful life is 15 years. It consists of 30 channels and operates on three frequencies. The first frequency is used to cover a large part of the Bolivian territory in internet services, the second frequency covers radio and communication broadcasts and the third frequency is planned to rent different types of transmissions to neighboring countries. The main customer of the Túpac Katari satellite services is the state-owned National Telecommunications Company (Entel), and the Government of Bolivia expected that the satellite would generate annual revenues of nearly $40 million for the provision of services to local and international firms.   CGWIC was the contractor responsible for project implementation, which commenced in August 2011. Bolivia's first communications satellite, Tupac Katari (TKSAT-1), was officially launched on December 20, 2013 from the Xinchang satellite launch center. It was launched by the LM-3B/E launch vehicle developed by China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT), and China Satellite Launch & Tracking Control General (CLTC) was responsible for the ground segment. On April 1, 2014, the satellite began commercial operations.
