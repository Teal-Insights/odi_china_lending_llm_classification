73140,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Development Bank provides $210.6 million loan for Ghana Accra Intelligent Traffic Management Project (Linked to Project ID#2034),"On December 16, 2011, China Development Bank and the Government of Ghana signed a $3 billion master facility agreement (see Project ID#2034). This agreement established two lending facilities: Tranche A and Tranche B. Tranche A is a $1.5 billion facility and any borrowings through this facility are undertaken with a 15 year maturity, 5 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.95% margin, a 0.25% upfront fee, and a 1% commitment fee. Tranche B is a $1.5 billion facility and any borrowings through this facility are undertaken with a 10 year maturity, 3 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.85% margin, and a 1% commitment fee. Both tranches are collateralized against cash proceeds from the sale of crude oil from the Jubilee field, which the borrower was required to deposit in a debt service reserve account (DSRA). The cash balance of the DSRA was GHS 370,586,909 ($71,266,713) in 2019.  [Note: A requirement of the master facility agreement was that the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) and the China International United Petroleum and Chemicals Co. (UNIPEC Asia) signed an offtaker for the sale and purchase of crude oil. Under the terms of this agreement, GNPC agreed to supply and sell 13,000 barrels of crude oil from Jubilee Field each day to UNIPEC Asia over a 15.5 year period. The proceeds from these oil sales were then deposited into a special account to facilitate loan repayment and provide a source of collateral.]  Under the terms of the master facility agreement, subsidiary loan agreements must be negotiated to secure financial support for any given project. On April 17, 2019, China Development Bank and the Government of Ghana also signed a subsidiary loan agreement worth $210,660,000 — using the Tranche B lending facility — for the Accra Intelligent Traffic Management Project. This project was originally identified as eligible for lending through the Tranche A facility; however, the Government of Ghana and CDB agreed to fund it through the Tranche B facility and shorten the maturity of the loan to ensure that the off-taker agreement did not extend beyond its current term. As such, the borrowing terms for this project (9 year maturity, 3 year grace period, 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.85% margin, and a 1% commitment fee) were slightly different than the terms specified for lending through the Tranche B facility in the master facility agreement signed on December 16, 2011.   The borrower was also responsible for paying a 5.56% lump sum Sinosure premium and maintaining a minimum cash balance of 1.3 times the repayment amount for each six month cycle in a designated DSRA at all times. The proceeds of the loan were to originally intended to be used by the borrower to finance approximately 85% of the cost of three commercial contracts worth $236,100,000:  (1) a $85,342,469.38 commercial contract between the Government of Ghana's Ministry of Roads and Highways and China Gansu International Corporation for Economic and Technical Cooperation for the Accra Metropolitan Area Intelligent Traffic Management and Roads Completion Project - La Beach Road Completion Project Phase I (Tema Road: Independence Arch to Nungua Barrier - 16.00km);  (2) a $50,757,530.632 commercial contract between the Government of Ghana's Ministry of Roads and Highways and China Railway Major Bridge Engineering Group Co. Ltd. for the Accra Metropolitan Area Intelligent Traffic Management and Roads Completion Project - La Beach Road Completion Project Phase 2 (Coastal and Meridian Roads - Nungua Barrier to Tema - 10.60 km); and  (3) a $100,000,000 commercial contract between the Government of Ghana's Ministry of Roads and Highways and Beijing Everyway Traffic & Lighting Tech. Co. Ltd. for Engineering, Procurement, Installation and Commissioning of the Accra Metropolitan Area Intelligent Traffic Management System. However, the Government of Ghana eventually canceled its commercial contract with Beijing Everyway Traffic & Lighting Tech. Co. Ltd., which resulted in the Chinese company seeking $55 million in damages via international arbitration.   The (principal) amount outstanding under the Tranche B lending facility was GHS 1,505,360,000 ($268,814,285) as of December 31, 2020 and GHS 1,107,600,000 ($213,000,000) as of December 31, 2021.  The rescoped project involves the widening of the 16 km La Beach Road (Independent Arch to Nungua Barrier); the widening of 10.6 km of Coastal and Meridian Roads (including the vehicular interchange at Nungua Barrier and 2 no. road over rail bridges near Sakumono Junction and Sakumono Lagoon); and the widening of the 7.5 km Teshie Link from Teshie to the Accra-Tema Motorway. This project officially commenced on February 21, 2020, and a groundbreaking ceremony was officially held on August 14, 2020 for the road development activities with the Vice President of Ghana, Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, presiding over the first sod cutting ceremony.  There are some indications that the CDB loan for the Ghana Accra Intelligent Traffic Management Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the World Bank’s International Development Statistics, the Government of Ghana had accumulated principal and interest arrears to one or more official sector Chinese creditors worth $908,337,346.70) in 2020 ($763,228,526.60 in principal arrears and $145,108,820.10 in interest arrears).
