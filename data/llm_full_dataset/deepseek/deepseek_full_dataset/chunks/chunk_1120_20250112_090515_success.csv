The GCL carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 5 year grace period, a maturity of 20 years, a 0.25% management fee, and a 0.25% commitment fee. China Eximbank disbursed RMB 129,294,990.84 in 2014, RMB 71,322,224.62 in 2015, RMB 50,827,659.58 in 2016, RMB 116,375,945.72 in 2017, RMB 190,284,964 in 2018, and RMB 45,285,961 in 2019. The loan had achieved a 123.8% disbursement rate (RMB 603,391,745.76 out of RMB 487,016,800) as of December 31, 2019. The borrower made no repayments in 2018.

On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a ‘pre-emptive’ sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. Its decision to suspend external debt service reportedly affected all China Eximbank loans with amounts outstanding at the time of the announcement.   The objective of the project was to meet the present and future demand of drinking water in the Greater Kurunegala area by increasing water supply capacity from 6500m3/d to 13000m3/d and establishing a proper waste water disposal system with a capacity 0f 4500m3/d. This project involved the construction of a new treatment plant, a pipe sewer network (135 km), water transmission lines(8km), water distribution network (110km), and two elevated water towers (Kurunagala 1750 m3/d, 750 m3/d at Vahara).   China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. The project commenced on February 26, 2014 and was completed on August 13, 2018.
