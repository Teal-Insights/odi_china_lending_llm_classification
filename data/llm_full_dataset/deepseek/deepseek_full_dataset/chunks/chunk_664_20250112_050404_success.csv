85268,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides RMB 3.59 billion buyer’s credit loan for 913 MW Lamard Combined Cycle Power Plant Project (Linked to Project ID#85267),"In 2017, China Eximbank and Iran’s Bank of Industry and Mine — an Iranian state-owned bank— signed an RMB 3,591,317,330 ($602 million) buyer’s credit loan agreement for the 913MW Lamard Combined Cycle Power Plant Project. Iran’s Ministry of Economy issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan in February 2017. The purpose of the project is to construct a 913MW combined cycle power plant in the Lamerd Special Economic Zone within the southern province of Fars and supply electricity to the aluminum smelter run by South Aluminum Corporation (SALCO or شرکت آلومینیوم جنوب). The project also involves the construction of an 11 km electricity transmission line, a 35 kilometer electricity transmission line, a 230kV electricity substation, and a 400kV electricity substation to evacuate power from the power plant to the national grid. The plant itself is located at the 8th km on Lamerd-Khonj road with the city of Lamerd. The locational coordinates of the plant are 27.335372, 53.157570. The construction of the plant is being implemented on a Build-Own-Operate (BOO) basis and financed with 85% debt and 15% equity. Ghadir Electricity & Energy Investment Co. and China National Electric Engineering Co (CNEEC) are the contractors responsible for implementation. By June 2019, the power plant was apparently under construction, including preliminary civil works. Then, in 2020, the first phase of the aluminum smelter launched (with two additional phases slated for 2025). As of August 2022, the project had achieved a 40% completion rate and the construction of the 11 km electricity transmission line and the electricity substations had reached completion.

According to internal records that Jamaica’s Ministry of Finance and the Public Service supplied to AidData in May 2020, the loan carried the following borrowing terms: a maturity period of 20 years, a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 3%, a commitment fee of 0.5%, and a management fee of 0.35%. The first scheduled date of loan repayment was January 21, 2022 and the final date of scheduled loan repayment was January 21, 2037. As of October 30, 2021, the loan had achieved an 27.3% disbursement rate ($89,238,535.16 out of $326,400,000). Its outstanding amount was $89,238,535.16 as of October 30, 2021. The borrower was expected to use the loan proceeds to finance a commercial contract that it signed with China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) in 2016.   The Southern Coastal Highway Improvement Project (SCHIP) has four core objectives: (1) Construction of a 16km, 4 lane highway with safety barriers from Harbour view to Yallahs, to be undertaken by CHEC at a cost of $110 million; (2) Rehabilitation of 96 km of road from Yallahs Bridge in St. Thomas to Port Antonio, in Eastern Portland, along the existing road alignment to reduce corners, improve safety and open up access to lands which may be of touristic value. This work will be administered by Jamaica's National Works Agency (NWA) and executed by local contractors under subcontract from CHEC at a cost of $74 million; (3) Rehabilitation of 26 km of roads from Morant Bay to Cedar Valley along the existing road alignment to reduce corners, improve safety and open access to lands which may be of touristic, housing or agricultural value. This work will be administered by the NWA and executed by local contractors under subcontract from CHEC at a cost of $11.4 million; and (4) The extension of the East West Toll Road from May Pen to Williamsfield, just outside Mandeville at a cost of $188.5 million.   China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) is the contractor responsible for project implementation. Project implementation commenced on November 17, 2019.

He told a group of journalists on June 2, 2022 that ‘some subcontractors are not living up to the responsibility of their contract… [and] where [they] are negligent then [CHEC] will step in and have those rectified.’ He also noted that the the commercial contract ‘makes it clear that where the subcontractor is insufficient in performance, [CHEC] is obligated to step in and do the work itself.’ At the same time, he expressed hope that subcontractors, many of whom are from Jamaica, would improve their performance to prevent CHEC from reassuming control for all project components.",1.
