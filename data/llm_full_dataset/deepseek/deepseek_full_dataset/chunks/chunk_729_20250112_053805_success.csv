Chinese financing has been pledged with agency participation from the Suriname Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Fisheries; Deputy Directorate for Agricultural Research, Marketing and Processing (ODLOAV); and the Deputy Directorate Livestock (ODVEE). Although the Suriname Ministry of Agriculture lists China as the funder, the specifics of the financial body or terms are unclear.  With the initial investment of $350,000 USD (although the Share4Dev source states only $350) and total budget of $10.4 million USD, field visits and stakeholder meetings took place, which concluded that there was potential for a demonstration center to accommodate new technology, experiments, and training. In the project proposal, the center will include a greenhouses, packing house, aquaculture hatchery/nursery and is projected to finish in 2022. In addition, 33 hectares have been identified for the demonstration center in Tawajari-polder in the Wanica District.  Page 81 of the Suriname 2018 Annual Plan (Jaarplan) indicates there is still continued cooperation on this project. A feasibility study is also to be conducted in 2018.
