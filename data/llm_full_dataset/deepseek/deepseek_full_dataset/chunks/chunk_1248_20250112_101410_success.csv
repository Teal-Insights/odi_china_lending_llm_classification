China Eximbank permitted DBK to draw down up to $5 billion from the MFA, which included an unrestricted $1.5 billion loan tranche (captured via Project ID#53547) and a restricted $3.5 billion loan tranche (captured via Project ID#54797). The MFA covered a period of up to 15 years and it prohibited DBK from incurring indebtedness exceeding 25% of its assets or disposing of over 25% of its assets, in addition to a change of control clause favoring China Eximbank. The restricted portion of the MFA was for projects with a ‘Chinese component’ (i.e. involving the purchase of Chinese goods and services), whereas the unrestricted portion was for DBK’s general purposes.   Under the restricted portion of the MFA, on September 29, 2009, DBK entered into an individual buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement (ID#BLA0927) with China Eximbank worth $3.5 billion. This BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a maturity period of 10 years (final maturity date: July 21, 2019) and a floating interest rate. As of late July 2009, the interest rate that applied to this BCL was 4-4.5% per annum. The restricted ($3.5 billion) portion of the China Eximbank MFA was aimed at the development of energy, transport and communication infrastructure and the funding of strategic projects in the metallurgy, chemical, and oil industries. 50% of the funds were to be used to purchase Chinese goods and services. The proceeds from the $3.5 billion BCL were also be used for investment projects of Kazakhstan companies, including the exporting of industrial output, services and equipment to China.

The maturity length of the restricted portion of the facility was 15 years and it had a floating interest rate. As of late July 2009, the interest rate was 4-4.5% per annum.   Under the unrestricted portion of the MFA, on October 24, 2009, DBK entered into an individual buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement (ID#BLA0918) with China Eximbank for the amount of $1.5 billion. This BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a maturity period of 10 years (final maturity date: July 21, 2019), a grace period of 2 years, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.843% in August 2009) plus a 5.5% margin. National Welfare Fund Samruk-Kazyna provided a repayment guarantee for funds borrowed by DBK under the unrestricted portion of the facility.

CDB provides $500 million supplemental loan to Development Bank of Kazakhstan for on-lending purposes (Linked to Project ID#54797, #40266, #53547, #96062)

# Description
On August 1, 2009, the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank) entered into a master facility agreement (MFA) with the Development Bank of Kazakhstan JSC (DBK). China Eximbank permitted DBK to draw down up to $5 billion from the MFA, which included an unrestricted $1.5 billion loan tranche (captured via Project ID#53547) and a restricted $3.5 billion loan tranche (captured via Project ID#54797). The MFA covered a period of up to 15 years and it prohibited DBK from incurring indebtedness exceeding 25% of its assets or disposing of over 25% of its assets, in addition to a change of control clause favoring China Eximbank. The restricted portion of the MFA was for projects with a ‘Chinese component’ (i.e. involving the purchase of Chinese goods and services), whereas the unrestricted portion was for DBK’s general purposes.   Under the restricted portion of the MFA, on September 29, 2009, DBK entered into an individual buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement (ID#BLA0927) with China Eximbank worth $3.5 billion. This BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a maturity period of 10 years (final maturity date: July 21, 2019) and a floating interest rate. As of late July 2009, the interest rate that applied to this BCL was 4-4.5% per annum. The restricted ($3.5 billion) portion of the China Eximbank MFA was aimed at the development of energy, transport and communication infrastructure and the funding of strategic projects in the metallurgy, chemical, and oil industries. 50% of the funds were to be used to purchase Chinese goods and services. The proceeds from the $3.5 billion BCL were also be used for investment projects of Kazakhstan companies, including the exporting of industrial output, services and equipment to China. National Welfare Fund Samruk-Kazyna provided a repayment guarantee for funds borrowed by DBK under the restricted portion of the facility. The maturity length of the restricted portion of the facility was 15 years and it had a floating interest rate. As of late July 2009, the interest rate was 4-4.5% per annum.   Under the unrestricted portion of the MFA, on October 24, 2009, DBK entered into an individual buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement (ID#BLA0918) with China Eximbank for the amount of $1.5 billion. This BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a maturity period of 10 years (final maturity date: July 21, 2019), a grace period of 2 years, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.843% in August 2009) plus a 5.5% margin. National Welfare Fund Samruk-Kazyna provided a repayment guarantee for funds borrowed by DBK under the unrestricted portion of the facility. On January 20, 2011, DBK prepaid a portion of the amount outstanding (worth $500 million) under the $1.5 billion loan agreement.   In addition, on June 9, 2011, DBK  and CDB entered into the supplemental loan agreement worth $500 million (captured via Project ID#96061). Under the agreement, DBK was permitted to draw down again, as a second tranche, the $500 million prepaid portion of the unrestricted portion of the MFA. This amendment also modified the terms of the loan agreement and, as a result, after July 21, 2011, interest applied at a fixed rate of 5.8% per annum (rather than a floating rate) and is payable semi-annually. Pursuant to an amendment agreement dated July 19, 2013, the interest rate was further reduced to 4% per annum. The July 19, 2013 loan rescheduling is captured via Project ID#96062).

The Government of Kenya, through various line ministries, supported the idea developed by Kenyatta University Management led by the then Vice-Chancellor, Prof Olive Mugenda. The idea came to fruition with the signing of an MoU on April 21, 2011, between the Chinese and Kenyan governments.   Then, on June 17, 2011, China Eximbank and the Government of Kenya’s National Treasury signed an RMB 744,560,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Kenyatta University Teaching Research & Referral Hospital Construction Project. The face value of the loan was subsequently revised to RMB 716,983,703.70. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20.75 year maturity, and a 7.25 year grace period. The loan was scheduled for semi-annual repayment installments beginning on September 21, 2018, and ending on March 21, 2032.    The National Treasury on-lent the proceeds of the GCL to Kenyatta University Teaching, Referral & Research Hospital (KUTRRH), which is a Kenyan state corporation. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the ultimate borrower to finance a commercial contract between the Government of Kenya and China Jiangxi Corporation for International Economic and Technical Co-operation (CJIC), which was signed on August 12, 2010.  The borrower made principal repayments worth RMB 27,576,296 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and RMB 55,152,592.00 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022).  The loan’s amount outstanding was RMB 661,831,110.11 as of June 30, 2020, RMB 606,678,517.52 as of June 30, 2021, and RMB 551,525,924.93 as of June 30, 2022.  The project involved the construction of Kenyatta University Teaching Research & Referral Hospital (肯雅塔大学教学转诊医院) in Nairobi. The hospital covers an area of more than 600 acres with a total construction area over 80,000 square meters, has a total of more than 650 beds, 8 high-grade operating rooms, 1 maternal center, 1 neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), 1 intensive care unit (ICU), 1 special intensive care unit (HDU), as well as medical imaging center, central supply room, oxygen, and medical gas system, boiler and laundry, medical waste treatment, funeral facilities, restaurant, teaching center, dormitory, and other supporting facilities. Construction of the 650-bed hospital involved the expansion and equipping of anatomy and basic science laboratories and the establishment of pre-clinical and clinical teaching departments at the university.    CJIC was the contractor responsible for implementation.  The project was originally scheduled to enter implementation in 2012 and reach completion by June 30, 2019. Construction commenced on November 1, 2012 and ended on December 14, 2016.   A formal project handover ceremony took place on May 24, 2019. However, the hospital did not open its doors to the first patient until October 28, 2019 after successfully conducting a ‘dry run’ from September 27, 2019 to October 27, 2019, followed by a successful 'soft run' from October 28, 2019 to November 24, 2019. To operationalize the first 160 beds, the hospital operationalized the oncology, renal dialysis, accident and emergency, trauma and orthopaedics, ICU, radiology, laboratory, pharmacy, mortuary, and other allied services. The hospital was designated as an isolation and treatment center on March 24, 2020 with over 400 beds designated for COVID-19 patients. A formal hospital opening ceremony took place on September 10, 2020. Then, in October 2021, an advanced cancer imaging center (known as the Integrated Molecular Imaging Centre Hospitality and Accommodation Centre) was launched at the hospital.   There are indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Kenyatta University Teaching Research & Referral Hospital Construction Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender and Kenya's National Treasury. As of October 17, 2018, 85% of the China Eximbank loan (worth 8,756,025,600 Kenyan shillings) had been disbursed and utilized. However, the remaining 15% of the loan (worth approximately 1.37 billion Kenyan shillings) had not yet disbursed in support of the personnel and capacity building component of the loan because disbursement was conditional upon the training of personnel (who were yet to be recruited by Kenyatta University due to ‘budgetary constraints’). KUTRRH was ultimately unable to meet its loan repayment obligations (due to the fact that it was generating insufficient revenue) and the National Treasury had to step in to ensure repayments to China Eximbank. Then, in December 2021, it was revealed by the Kenyan Government that KUTRRH was converted into an independent parastatal entity (and severed from Kenyatta University) on January 25, 2019 in order to use its future revenues to recover the funds needed to repay the China Eximbank loan.","1.
