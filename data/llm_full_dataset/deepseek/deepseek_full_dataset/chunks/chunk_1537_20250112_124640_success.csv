China Nonferrous Metal Mining Group and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Group created a joint venture in order to implement the Tagaung Taung Nickel Mine Project.  The total cost of the project was more than $870 million and it reportedly secured debt financing from China Eximbank and China Development Bank. Previously in June 2007, the nickel mining project was approved by the government and reportedly secured the commitment of financial support from China Development Bank and China Eximbank. Construction was expected to begin later in 2007.   The purpose of the project was to develop a nickel mine within Tigyaing Township, Katha District, Sagaing Region (exact locational coordinates are 23.578243, 96.152611). The mine has a reserve of more than 30 million tons of high-grade nickel ore containing some 700,000 tons of nickel. The average nickel content of the mine is 2%, which is likely to yield 800,000 metric tons (annual output of 85,000 tons) of ferro-nickel. On May 17, 2009, a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place. The mine was completed in June 2011. It reportedly employs more than 1,500 workers, both Myanmar and Chinese nationals.  The project faced various controversies and disputes. According to a Myanmar Times report in 2016, a contract that China’s CNMC Nickel Company Ltd. (CNICO) signed in 2007 called for the seizure of more than 3,000 acres (1,200 hectares) of land and the payment of 50,000 kyats (U.S. $32) an acre in lost crop compensation for 122 farmers in five communities comprising the Maung Kone village tract. Maung Kone residents later reported that the compensation they received failed to take into account the contamination of their fields and the nearby Irrawaddy River by the plant’s solid waste runoff, and they demanded additional payment. The 500 acres of land on which the plant’s operators dumped coal waste were nearly full, villagers said, so that when it rains, the runoff flowed directly into the waterway and nearby cultivated fields.   Residents of Maung Kone village, which sits between the nickel-mining operations and a sugar-processing plant, also said that polluted air and solid waste from both operations affected their health, and they accused both plants of discharging wastewater directly into the Irrawaddy River. When residents went to the village tract health department to discuss the situation, the medical officer in charge reportedly said he could not answer their questions because he did not have permission from his superiors. According to the Myanmar Alliance of Transparency and Accountability, the July 28, 2008 production sharing contract has also proven controversial because it provides for the Government of Myanmar to receive only 1 percent of revenue, and the Chinese company 99 percent, when the price of nickel falls below $15,000 a ton.

China Eximbank provides RMB 300 million government concessional loan for Myanmar Section of Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Information Superhighway Network (ISN) Project (Linked to Project ID#96221, 98029)

# Description
In July 2005, China, Myanmar, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the Planning and Construction of a Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Information Superhighway Network (ISN). Then, on February 14, 2006, Myanmar’s Minister for Communications, Posts and Telegraphs Brig-Gen Thein Zaw and China’s Minister for Information Industry Wang Xudong signed an MOU on the Construction of Greater Mekong Information Superhighway Myanmar Section.   In March 2007, China Eximbank and the Government of Myanmar signed an RMB 300 million government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Myanmar Section of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Information Superhighway Network (ISN) Project. The borrowing terms of the GCL are unknown. However, it is known that the proceeds of the GCL were to be used to finance a commercial (EPC) contract between Myanmar Post and Telecommunications Corporation and Alcatel-Shanghai Bell Co Ltd., which was signed on June 11, 2007.   The purpose of the project's Myanmar section was to lay more than 2000 km of fiber optic cable from Muse to Tachilek via Mandalay and Yangon. Phase 1 of the project was complete as of March 2008. Also, in March 2008, a Myanmar–China fiber optic link was built from Kunming to Muse (on the China border) with its link further extended to reach Yangon.  However, it is unclear whether/when Phase 2 commenced, and how it was financed.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Myanmar Section of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Information Superhighway Network (ISN) Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Myanmar signed a debt suspension agreement as part of the G-20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between May 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under 3 buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreements, 6 government concessional loan (GCL) agreements, and 27 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreements (as captured via Project ID#98029).  Debt service payments under many of these loan agreements were again deferred in 2021 (as captured via Project ID#96221).",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,General Infrastructure,Project focuses on communications infrastructure development without clear environmental or energy transition impacts,"Fiber optic cable network construction, communications sector focus, no direct energy or environmental components mentioned"
