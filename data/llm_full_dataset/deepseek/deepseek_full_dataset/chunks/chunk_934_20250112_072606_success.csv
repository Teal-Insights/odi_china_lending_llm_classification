China Eximbank agreed to cover 82% of the total project cost, with the Government of Pakistan covering the remaining 18%. This 'mixed credit' arrangement produced four different financial commitments: two preferential buyer's credits (PBC), one government concessional loan (GCL), and one buyer's credit loan (BCL). On January 14, 2014, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed a $382,848,800 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2013) 50 TOTAL NO. (294)]. Its borrowing terms are unknown (captured via Project ID#92413). On February 19, 2014, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed an RMB 2.647 billion government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2014) 5 TOTAL NO. (509)] carrying a 1% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and an 8 year grace period (captured via Project ID#41916). On December 15, 2015, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed a $3,618,151,200 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (15) 18 TOTAL NO. (360) and Government of Pakistan loan ID# PBC-2015-18-360] for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 8 year grace period (captured via Project ID#41918). This agreement was amended on October 8, 2019 [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (15) 18 TOTAL NO. (360) (A)], but the purpose of the amendment is unknown. Additionally, on December 18, 2015, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed a $2.25 billion buyer’s credit loan (BCL) [Government of Pakistan loan ID#BC-BLA201401 and BCL 2015212932] carrying a 6% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 8 year grace period (captured via Project ID#41917).  The Government of Pakistan on-lent some or all of the proceeds of the China Eximbank loans to Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) -- a federally funded independent governmental agency -- at a 15% interest rate. The Government of Pakistan also reportedly issued sovereign guarantees for all four China Eximbank loans that supported the project. In December 2015, the amounts outstanding under all four China Eximbank loans (worth $5.668 billion) were reportedly transferred by the Government of Pakistan to PAEC (as the direct borrower).   The purpose of the project was to construct units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP), which is located in Paradise Point in Karachi within Sindh Province.  China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. It is using Hualon One technology (the CNNC's third-generation nuclear reactor design) to construct Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on November 26, 2013. Then, a major milestone was reached at the K-2 reactor when so-called ‘cold functional tests’ began on November 26, 2019. Cold functional tests are carried out to confirm whether the main system and its supporting facilities are properly installed and ready to operate under high-pressure conditions. K-2 was ultimately connected to the national grid on March 18, 2021. It was officially inaugurated on May 21, 2021 and put into operation on May 24, 2021. The K-3 reactor came online on March 4, 2022. The project was originally expected to reach completion by the end of 2020.  There are some indications that the $2.250 billion China Eximbank buyer's credit loan for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In May 2019, PAEC sought the Prime Minister's approval to have the interest rates of the China Eximbank loans for Units 2 and 3 of the KANUPP Project reset to their original levels (when they were first issued by China Eximbank). Local sources reported at the time that the electricity tariff determined by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) was set on the basis of actual electricity generation costs and on-lending at a 15% rate increased actual electricity generation costs by PKR 108 billion (necessitating an PKR 1.8/kWh increase in the tariff rate). However, it is unclear if the Prime Minister approved PAEC’s request. Then, on or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the $2.250 billion buyer's credit loan agreement for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project.

Then, on October 16, 2015, China Eximbank and Port Qasim Electric Power Company (Pvt.) Limited (PQEPCPL) signed a $1,598,380,000 term facility (loan) agreement for the Port Qasim 2x660MW Coal-Fired Power Project. The borrowing terms are as follows: 14-year maturity, 4-year grace rate, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3.70% margin. The Government of Pakistan provided a sovereign guarantee for the loan and a 27.2% guaranteed return on equity to the project sponsors (investors). Sinosure also provided credit insurance for the loan. These insurance fees amounted to 4% of total debt service (principal and amortized interest). As of October 2018, China Eximbank has reportedly disbursed $975 million through the loan.   PQEPCPL is a project company (special purpose vehicle) that was established in 2014 for the sole purpose of designing, financing, insuring, building, establishing, owning, operating, maintaining, and managing the Port Qasim 2x660MW Coal-Fired Power Project. The sponsors and shareholders of PQEPCPL are Sinohydro Resources Ltd. (51% ownership stake) and Al-Mirqab Capital (AMC) of Qatar (49% ownership stake). The total cost of this project was approximately $2.1 billion and it was financed with a debt-to-equity ratio of approximately 75:25. China Eximbank provided a $1,598,380,000 loan for the project, and the remainder was covered via $521 million of equity contributions from Sinohydro Resources Ltd. and AMC.   The Port Qasim 2x660MW Coal-Fired Power Project is located in the Port Qasim Industrial Park (exact locational coordinates: 24.7854°N 67.3695°E), and it consists of two modern supercritical coal-fired units, a self-dedicated coal unloading jetty and a 4 km-length channel dredged and transferred to Port Qasim Authority. The coal will be imported. The project, which is being implemented on build-own-operate (BOO) basis, is one of the largest “Priority Implementation Projects” under China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The EPC contractors are Sinohydro Harbour Co., Ltd and CCCC Second Harbor Consultants Co., Ltd. A groundbreaking ceremony for the project took place on April 20, 2015. Construction then began in May 2015. On November 29, 2017, Yao Jing, the Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan, accompanied the Prime Minister of Pakistan to the power generation ceremony of the first unit of the coal power plant at Port Qasim. Then, on April 24, 2018, the project reached its commercial operations date (COD).   This project has been plagued by controversy. Transparency International Pakistan alleged that PQEPCPL and NEPRA colluded to set a tariff for the coal-fired power plant and artificially inflated the cost of the project. In August 2019, Prime Minister Imran Khan directed the formation of a committee to examine the causes of the ‘high cost of electricity’ and circular debt, and to propose a way forward to ensure ‘the future energy security of the country.’ The committee was given 12 weeks to complete the onerous set of tasks, which it concluded in April 2020 in the form of a 296-page report, titled ‘Report on the Power Sector: Committee for Power Sector Audit, Circular Debt Resolution & Future Roadmap’. The report claims that the cost of the Port Qasim 2x660MW Coal-Fired Power Project was artificially inflated.   Then, in May 2022, it was revealed that PQEPCPL was having difficulty servicing its China Eximbank loan (including a $70 million principal payment due on May 31, 2022) due to the fact that the Government of Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to PQEPCPL. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 91.2 billion (approximately $483,360,000). PQEPCPL, in turn, had payment arrears to its coal supplier amounting to $140,000,000. As of May 2022, the coal supplier had stopped providing coal for the Port Qasim 2x660MW Coal-Fired Power Plant due to large outstanding payments. PQEPCPL warned that ‘without urgent payments to restore coal supply, the whole complex will shut down shortly’. Documents showed that the Port Qasim power plant also sustained losses of $153 million due to rupee devaluation. PQEPCPL official reportedly told the Pakistani authorities that ‘[s]ince 2014, billions of US dollars have been invested, thousands of people have worked hard for seven years but today the company has no cash, low coal inventory, huge outstanding payments, a huge exchange loss, making coal supplier and operation and maintenance contract bankrupt and facing loan default soon.’   Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this '[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Then, on May 15, 2023, PQEPC served a formal notice of payment default on the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA). The total overdue amount that CPPA owed to PQEPC at that time was $263.5 million. PQEPC's power purchase agreement states that a failure to pay an undisputed amount by the CPPA within 35 days of the notice constitutes a power purchaser event of default. PQEPC demanded that CPPA make a principal payment of $73.6 million before May 31, 2023 to avoid a 'facility agreement default' as well as a Government of Pakistan or 'GoP default'.","1. The Chinese project title is 巴基斯坦卡西姆港燃煤应急电站项目 or 卡西姆港燃煤发电项目1320MW. 2. According to multiple, official sources, the Government of Pakistan has issued sovereign guarantees in support of all loans issued by Chinese state-owned banks for independent power projects (IPPs) in Pakistan (see https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cepk/chn/zbgx/t1735166.htm and http://pk.chineseembassy.org/eng/zbgx/202110/t20211010_9558510.htm and https://www.dropbox.com/s/bmx3w2b38o7guxm/Debt%20Pricing%20of%20IPPs%20%28002%29.pdf?dl=0). As such, AidData assumes that the loan captured in this record is backed by a sovereign guarantee from the Government of Pakistan.3. On November 8, 2014, the Chinese Government and the Government of Pakistan signed a CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement. According to Article 5 of the Agreement, ‘the Pakistani Party agrees that a revolving account shall be opened with 30 days of commercial operation of the respective project, into which the money, no less than the 22 per cent of the monthly payments for the respective power project under the agreement shall be deposited to provide cover for the shortfall in power bill recoveries from the date of power generation of the said projects agreements subject to the condition that the additional direct and indirect expenses incurred in maintaining the revolving account would be compensated by the producers through a discount arrangement to be mutually agreed.’ Subsequently, the Finance Division, in consultation with the Power Division, finalized a mechanism for the Revolving Account (RA) with the approval of The Minister of Finance in a letter date June 22, 2015. Then, in September 2017, the Power Division forwarded a draft Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) to be signed between Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guaranteed (CPPA-G) and power producer(s) to the Finance Division. CPPA-G subsequently executed the finalized draft of RAA with multiple CPEC IPPs. The Government of Pakistan also guaranteed the funding obligations of the CPPA with respect to the RAA, through Supplemental Implementation Agreements signed between the Government of Pakistan — through the Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) — and the respective IPPs.","# Sector

Ltd. (DPPL) signed a $78.82 million loan for the 49.5 MW Wind Farm Project. Based on DPPL’s tariff petition to Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA,) the estimated terms of the ICBC loan are as follows: an 11 year maturity, a 1 year grace period, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (5.4%) plus a 3% margin (or 8.4%). On January 4, 2016, ICBC announced that it disbursed the first loan disbursement (worth $25 million) for this project. On April 22, 2015, President Xi visited Pakistan to witness the groundbreaking ceremony alongside Prime Minister Nawaz Shariff via video display.   Dawood Power (Pvt.) Ltd.

This independent power project (IPP) was financed with a debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30. It was implemented on a Build-Own-Operate (BOO) basis. DPPL signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with the Pakistan Power Grid Corporation that uses the “cost + return” method to price the electricity.   This project, which was designated as a priority infrastructure project for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), involved the installation of thirty three wind turbine generators (WTGs) from GoldWind, each of which generates 1.50 MW of power.

The 99 MW Jhimpir Wind Project was implemented as an independent power project (IPP) basis. It was reportedly financed with a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25. Based on UEP Wind’s tariff application to Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), the estimated terms of the CDB loan are as follows: 10 year maturity, 2 year grace period, and 5.45% interest rate.   The construction of the United Energy Pakistan (UEP) wind farm involved the installation of 66 wind turbine generators (WTGs), each of which generates 1.5 MW of electricity.

Lahore, the capital of Punjab province, is Pakistan’s most populous and prosperous province with more than 5 million people. Pakistani officials expected the new transport system, the first of its kind in the country, to substantially decrease road traffic. Then, on December 21, 2015, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed three separate loan agreements for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project. The first loan agreement is a $203.25 million buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement [ID#BC-OLL-2015 and ID#2015212493]. It carries a 5.2% interest rate, 2 year grace period, and 20 year maturity (captured via Project ID#53820). The second loan agreement is a $1,235,480,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2015) 34 TOTAL NO. (377) or ID#PBC-OLL15-34377]. It carries a 20 year maturity and a 2% interest rate (captured via Project ID#37280). The third loan agreement is an RMB 1,200,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) loan agreement [ID#GCL-OLL15-20559 or CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2015) 20 TOTAL NO. (559)]. It carries a 2% interest rate and 20 year maturity (captured via Project ID#54420). The proceeds of the GCL, PBC, and BCL were used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract between Punjab Mass Transit Authority (PMA) and CR-NORINCO [a joint venture of China State Railway Group Co. Ltd. (CR) and China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO)], which was signed on April 20, 2015.   According to the Government of Pakistan’s Economic Affairs Division, $672.7 million of the “mixed credit” (GCL, PBC, and BCL) from China Eximbank had been disbursed as of June 30, 2017.  The Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project involved the construction of a 27km two-lane metro bus corridor runs through the heart of Lahore along Multan Road, McLeod Road, and GT Road. Upon completion, the Orange Metro Line was expected to have capacity for 30,000 passenger per hour and serve 250,000 passengers per day.   CR-NORINCO — a joint venture of China State Railway Group Co. Ltd. (CR) and China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) — was the entity responsible for project implementation. The project was initially expected to begin by the end of 2014 and last for 27 months (estimated completed date: March 31, 2017). The project was ultimately completed on December 10, 2019. However, it encountered various problems and delays during implementation. The Lahore Development Authority began marking sites for demolition in August 2015, including government buildings, royal tombs, mosques, schools, and residences. Civil works were then initiated by CN-NORINCO on October 25, 2015. Popular protests prompted the Lahore high court to suspend work surrounding heritage sites in January 2016 while the court deliberated the issue. Then, in August 2016, the Lahore high court ruled that the government could not evict people or harm the heritage sites. The Punjab provincial government challenged the ruling, and in April 2017, the Supreme Court reversed its decision, allowing construction to continue under 31 conditions to limit the disruption and damage of the project. Then, in May 2019, a special audit of the project project was submitted to the federal government. The audit revealed losses to the national exchequer and alleged irregularities worth billions of rupees. More specifically, the audit disclosed that no framework agreement existed between the federal and provincial governments and that sub-contractors were granted several contracts without any approval. The audit claimed that a loss of $1,528,000 had been incurred to the national exchequer. It also claimed more than $1.4 million had been spent on the basis of favoritism with regard to project allowance.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank buyer’s credit loan for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the buyer’s credit loan agreement for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project.

# Title
China Eximbank provides $203.25 million buyer's credit loan for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project (Linked to Project ID#37280, #57673, and #54420)

# Description
On April 27, 2011, the Government of Pakistan first announced its interest in pursuing a project to develop a city-wide train system in the eastern city of Lahore. Lahore, the capital of Punjab province, is Pakistan’s most populous and prosperous province with more than 5 million people. Pakistani officials expected the new transport system, the first of its kind in the country, to substantially decrease road traffic. Then, on December 21, 2015, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed three separate loan agreements for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project. The first loan agreement is a $203.25 million buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement [ID#BC-OLL-2015 and ID#2015212493]. It carries a 5.2% interest rate, 2 year grace period, and 20 year maturity (captured via Project ID#53820). The second loan agreement is a $1,235,480,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2015) 34 TOTAL NO. (377) or ID#PBC-OLL15-34377]. It carries a 20 year maturity and a 2% interest rate (captured via Project ID#37280). The third loan agreement is an RMB 1,200,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) loan agreement [ID#GCL-OLL15-20559 or CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2015) 20 TOTAL NO. (559)]. It carries a 2% interest rate and 20 year maturity (captured via Project ID#54420). The proceeds of the GCL, PBC, and BCL were used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract between Punjab Mass Transit Authority (PMA) and CR-NORINCO [a joint venture of China State Railway Group Co. Ltd. (CR) and China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO)], which was signed on April 20, 2015.   According to the Government of Pakistan’s Economic Affairs Division, $672.7 million of the “mixed credit” (GCL, PBC, and BCL) from China Eximbank had been disbursed as of June 30, 2017.  The Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project involved the construction of a 27km two-lane metro bus corridor runs through the heart of Lahore along Multan Road, McLeod Road, and GT Road. Upon completion, the Orange Metro Line was expected to have capacity for 30,000 passenger per hour and serve 250,000 passengers per day.   CR-NORINCO — a joint venture of China State Railway Group Co. Ltd. (CR) and China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) — was the entity responsible for project implementation. The project was initially expected to begin by the end of 2014 and last for 27 months (estimated completed date: March 31, 2017). The project was ultimately completed on December 10, 2019. However, it encountered various problems and delays during implementation. The Lahore Development Authority began marking sites for demolition in August 2015, including government buildings, royal tombs, mosques, schools, and residences. Civil works were then initiated by CN-NORINCO on October 25, 2015. Popular protests prompted the Lahore high court to suspend work surrounding heritage sites in January 2016 while the court deliberated the issue. Then, in August 2016, the Lahore high court ruled that the government could not evict people or harm the heritage sites. The Punjab provincial government challenged the ruling, and in April 2017, the Supreme Court reversed its decision, allowing construction to continue under 31 conditions to limit the disruption and damage of the project. Then, in May 2019, a special audit of the project project was submitted to the federal government. The audit revealed losses to the national exchequer and alleged irregularities worth billions of rupees. More specifically, the audit disclosed that no framework agreement existed between the federal and provincial governments and that sub-contractors were granted several contracts without any approval. The audit claimed that a loss of $1,528,000 had been incurred to the national exchequer. It also claimed more than $1.4 million had been spent on the basis of favoritism with regard to project allowance.
