The purpose of the project is to build and supply 630 railway cars for Tehran’s subway system. The EPC contract was evidently financed through an EPC Plus Financing (EPC+F) arrangement (a common way in which Chinese banks and companies finance EPC contracts in Iran). In March 2018, Hossein Rajab Salahi, Director General of the Urban Rail Transportation Bureau of Iran’s Urban and Rural Municipalities Organization — an organization that is affiliated with Iran’s Interior Ministry — told the media that ‘[w]e are negotiating to sign a contract as we speak.   The Chinese company Norinco Group will function as the finance coordinator in this project.’ The EPC contract was temporarily put on hold after the U.S. reintroduced sanctions against Iran in May 2018.
