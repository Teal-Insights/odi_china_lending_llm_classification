89626,OTHER MULTISECTOR,Chinese Government provides USD 15 million for the China-Argentina Radio Telescope (CART) Construction Project,"On June 22, 2015, one Chinese entity and three Government of Argentina entities signed the quadripartite ""Collaboration Agreement for the Construction, Installation and Operation of the China-Argentina Radio Telescope (CART)"" in San Juan, Argentina. This agreement was approved by Law No. 1386-B of the Chamber of Deputies of San Juan, on December 17, 2015. The signatories included the National University of San Juan (UNSJ), the Provincial Government of San Juan, Argentina's National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET), and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) National Astronomical Observatories (NAOC).   At an unknown time, the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology agreed to provide USD 15 million for purchasing the satellite dish. Moreover, the Government of San Juan provided USD 1.5 million for constructing the base on which the satellite would be installed, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences provided USD 5 million for constructing the radio telescope.   The purpose of this project was to construct a radio telescope and all other necessary facilities located at the Dr. Carlos Ulrico Cesco Height Station in the town of El Leoncito, department of Calingasta, about 250 km from the city of San Juan. The telescope's primary reflector is 40 meters in diameter, making it the largest in South America. This project also included the installation of an antenna, positioning system, receiver, and data processing system. The purpose of CART is to promote the astronomical cooperation and exchanges between the Chinese and Argentinian governments as well as conduct scientific research in the fields of international VLBI, astronomical observation, geodesy, and deep space exploration. CART is the first medium and large astronomical observation equipment placed overseas by China.  According to the June 2015 agreement, the Government of San Juan is responsible for the provision of all services, electricity, water, internet and the access route to the place where the CART will be located. This access road was carried out by Vialidad de la Provincia as well as the excavations where the support base was built. The Government of Argentina and the National University of San Juan are in charge of the construction of the base for the radio telescope. A Chinese manufacturer would send 30 Chinese technicians to help the Argentinians assemble the radio telescope. Other parties involved in this project are the China Ministry of Science and Technology, the Argentina Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, and San Juan Provincial Government's Secretariat of Science, Technology and Innovation and Secretariat of Roads.  In 2017, the cornerstone was officially presented in 2017 and the the NAOC reported that progress on the radio telescope had reached 70%. In 2018, work on the access road to the CART was complete.
