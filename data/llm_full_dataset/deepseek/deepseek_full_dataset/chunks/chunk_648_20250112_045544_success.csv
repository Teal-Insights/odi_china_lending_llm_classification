48765,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides $218 million preferential buyer's credit for Phase II of Aysha Wind Power Project (Linked to Project ID#30911),"On May 12, 2017, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed a preferential buyer credit (PBC) loan agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC. No (2017) 8 TOTAL No. (434)] worth $218,692,386 for Phase 2 of the Aysha Wind Power Project. On July 5, 2017, the Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified the PBC agreement under Proclamation No.1044/2017. The proclamation went into effect on August 3, 2017. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 85% of the total cost of a $257,285,160 commercial (EPC) contract between Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCO) and Dongfang Electric Corporation, which was signed on January 15, 2016.  According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $218,692,386 (ETB 3,216,027,397) PBC achieved a 34% disbursement rate as of October 28, 2019, with China Eximbank making 3 loan disbursements (worth $59,759.07180 or ETB 1,727,628,763) between 2018 and 2019: a $12,882,512.77 (ETB 355,185,058) disbursement on June 29, 2018, a $12,244,641.29 (ETB 355,832,746) disbursement on August 9, 2019, and a $34,631,917.74 (ETB 1,016,610,959) disbursement on October 25, 2019.   The purpose of the project is to install 80 wind turbines with a single unit capacity of 1.5 megawatts with a total installed capacity of 120 megawatts. The project also involves the construction of access roads for operation and maintenance (O&M), the construction of one 230kV step-up substation connected to the 230kV national grid, and provision of training to the O&M team. The EPC contract with Dongfang Electric Corporation also specifies a 5-year Defect Liability Period. Once operational, the wind farm is expected to have an annual power output of 467 gigawatt-hours and provide power to the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway and the Dire Dawa Industrial Park. It is also expected to ensure stable and sufficient power for the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Economic Corridor. Additionally, it is envisaged that part of the electricity that Aysha wind farm generates will be exported to Djibouti to generate foreign exchange for Ethiopia.   The project site is located in the Shenelle Zone of the Ethiopian Somali State some 465 km north-east of Addis Ababa. Dongfang Electric Corporation is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation.   The implementation of the project commenced on February 25, 2017 and it was originally expected to reach completion within 18 months (August 25, 2018). However, a formal groundbreaking ceremony did not take place until May 2018 and the project has encountered various delays and implementation problems. First, EEPCO was unable to pay an advance payment to Dongfang Electric Corporation (per the contractual schedule) due to ‘financial constraints’. Second, wind turbine installation has proven challenging due to high and variable wind speeds, which have made it difficult to lift heavy load; the nacelle, tower and generator had to be hoisted into place when the wind speed was less than 10m/s. Third, due to high temperature, most of the concrete pouring of the WTG foundation had to be done at night. Fourth, land compensation and right of way issues led to implementation problems. When Dongfang Electric Corporation started site works after receiving right of way from EEPCO, some people started to build dwelling near the project site and Dongfang Electric Corporation was forced to stop site work. Fifth, there was a delay of cement supply from a local factory due to projects’ priority by government. Sixth, construction was interrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In late March 2020, Dongfang Electric Corporation was delivering equipment — including a wind turbine, a generator and a tower — from Djibouti Port to the project site in Ethiopia. But at that time Ethiopia had just shut down its border to minimize the spread of the coronavirus, which left four Chinese technicians stranded in Ethiopia. Dongfang Electric Corporation then sent technicians from its headquarters in China to enable the work required to transport the equipment. That action reportedly prevented the construction work from grinding to a halt. On July 12, 2021, Dongfang Electric Corporation (DEC) held an online open house event at the Aysha Wind Farm Project.   As of August 2021, the project had reportedly achieved a 75% completion rate and generated more than 300 local jobs. The project's scheduled completion date was eventually pushed back until the end of 2022.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase II of the Aysha Wind Power Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs.

China Eximbank provides $262.2 million preferential buyer's credit for Phase III of Ethiopia-Hunan Industrial Park Project

# Description
On May 19, 2017, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed a $262,259,100 (ETB 6,034,721,687) preferential buyer credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC. No. (2017) 16 TOTAL No.(442)] for Phase III of the Ethiopia-Hunan Industrial Park Project. On July 5, 2017, the Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified the PBC under Proclamation No.1045/2017. The proclamation went into effect on August 3; 2017.   The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $300 million commercial (EPC) contract with China Geo-engineering Construction Overseas Company Group (CGCOC).  The purpose of the project was to construct a 122 hectare industrial park — in the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Port Industrial Economic Corridor — that will house at least 18 Chinese enterprises that produce heavy machinery and power equipment. More specifically, it involved the construction of access roads and utilities, factories, office spaces, and related infrastructure. The Adama (Ethiopia-Hunan) Machinery and Industrial Park is located on 300 hectares of land near the city of Adama and is about 100 kilometres to the south-east of the capital Addis Ababa. It is 2 km from the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway Adama Station, and 300 meters from the Addis-Adama Expressway Exit.   CGCOC was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) was also involved (most likely as a subcontractor). Project implementation commenced on November 9, 2017 and the project reached completion on October 7, 2018.  Ethiopia-Hunan (Adama) Industrial Park Operation and Management Company is now responsible for investment promotion and the operation and management of the park. According to the CGCOC, Hunan companies including Sany Heavy Industry Company, TBEA Hengyang Transformer Company, and Foton Automobile are planning to establish factories in the industrial park.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase III of the Ethiopia-Hunan Industrial Park Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges.

59627,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides $81.4 million loan for Bole-Lemi and Kilinto Industrial Zone Power Transmission Project,"On December 12, 2017, China Eximbank and Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCo) — an Ethiopian state-owned power company — signed a $81,401,534.20 (ETB 1,819,025,346) commercial loan agreement for the Bole-Lemi and Kilinto Industrial Zone Power Transmission Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the Ethiopian Government issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 83% of the cost of a $98 million commercial contract between EEPCo and TBEA Co., Ltd., which was signed in April 2016.   According to the Government of Ethiopia’s AMP, the ETB 1,819,025,346 loan achieved a 68% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making a single loan disbursement worth ETB 1,245,292,880 on September 9, 2019.   The purpose of the project was to construct 28.4 km of 400 kV and 230 kV high voltage electricity transmission lines to the Bole and Kilinto Industrial Zones in Addis Ababa, construct a 230/33 kV Kilinto substation, construct a 230/33 kV Bole-Lemi Power substation, construct a 400/230/15 kV Koye Abbo substation, and expand an existing 400 kV Gelan substation.   TBEA Co., Ltd. is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. This project reportedly entered implementation and was nearing completion in 2009. Kilinto, Bole-Lemi, and Koye Abbo substation commissioning and testing activities began in December 2019.   However, this project has encountered major implementation problems. In June 2020, an electricity transmission tower collapsed after burglars attempted to steal equipment from it, leaving 22 companies operating in Bole-Lemi Industrial Park without electricity.   There are also indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Bole-Lemi and Kilinto Industrial Zone Power Transmission Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616).

Multiple sources identify the project as a commercial loan; therefore, AidData has coded the loan type as non-concessional for the time being. 3. This project is also known as the Bole-Lemi and Kilinto Industry Zone Power Transmission Project and the Akaki–Koye Abbo-Klinto-Bole-Lemi High Voltage Transmission Line and Substations Project. The Chinese project title is Bole Lemi和Kilinto两个工业园供电项目. 4. The AMP system identification number for the project is 87143436115038. The AMP identifies December 6, 2016 rather than December 12, 2017 as the loan commitment date. This issue warrants further investigation. 5. For the time being, AidData relies on the first loan disbursement date (September 9, 2019) as a proxy for the project implementation start date. This issue warrants further investigation. 6.
