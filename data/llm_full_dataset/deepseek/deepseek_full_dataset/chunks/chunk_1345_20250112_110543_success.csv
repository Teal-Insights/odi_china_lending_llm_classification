The proceeds of the GCL, PBC, and BCL were to be used by the borrower to finance a $2.37 billion commercial contract between Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) and Shanghai Nuclear Engineering Research and Design Institute, which was signed on April 28, 2009.   As of June 20, 2017, $1.513 billion had been disbursed by China Eximbank for the Chashma Nuclear Power Project 3 and Chashma Nuclear Power Project across all three loan agreements (PBC, GCL, and BCL).   The purpose of the project was to construct Unit 3 and Unit 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant (or CHASNUPP), which is a large commercial nuclear power plant located in the vicinities of Chashma colony and Kundian in Punjab in Pakistan (exact locational coordinates are 32.390278, 71.4625). More specifically, the purpose of the project was to (a) construct CHASNUPP-III, a 315-MW two-loop pressurized water reactor (PWR), using between 2.4—3.0% low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel with a gross capacity of 340 MW; and (b) construct CHASNUPP-IV, another 315-MW two-loop pressurized reactor with a gross capacity of 340 MW.    China Zhongyuan Engineering, China Nuclear Industry No.5 Construction Company, and Shanghai Nuclear Engineering and Research Design Institute were the contractors responsible for Unit 3 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. China National Nuclear Cooperation (CNNC) was the contractor responsible for Unit 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) supervised the work of all four Chinese contractors.  Construction of CHASNUPP-III (also known as C3 or Unit 3) commenced on May 28, 2011. CHASNUPP-III joined the nation's electricity grid system on October 15, 2016 and commenced its operations on December 6, 2016. It was officially inaugurated on December 28, 2016. Construction of CHASNUPP-IV (also known as C4 or Unit 4) started on December 18, 2011.

The proceeds of the GCL, PBC, and BCL were to be used by the borrower to finance a $2.37 billion commercial contract between Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) and Shanghai Nuclear Engineering Research and Design Institute, which was signed on April 28, 2009.   As of June 20, 2017, $1.513 billion had been disbursed by China Eximbank for the Chashma Nuclear Power Project 3 and Chashma Nuclear Power Project across all three loan agreements (PBC, GCL, and BCL).   The purpose of the project was to construct Unit 3 and Unit 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant (or CHASNUPP), which is a large commercial nuclear power plant located in the vicinities of Chashma colony and Kundian in Punjab in Pakistan (exact locational coordinates are 32.390278, 71.4625). More specifically, the purpose of the project was to (a) construct CHASNUPP-III, a 315-MW two-loop pressurized water reactor (PWR), using between 2.4—3.0% low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel with a gross capacity of 340 MW; and (b) construct CHASNUPP-IV, another 315-MW two-loop pressurized reactor with a gross capacity of 340 MW.    China Zhongyuan Engineering, China Nuclear Industry No.5 Construction Company, and Shanghai Nuclear Engineering and Research Design Institute were the contractors responsible for Unit 3 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. China National Nuclear Cooperation (CNNC) was the contractor responsible for Unit 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) supervised the work of all four Chinese contractors.  Construction of CHASNUPP-III (also known as C3 or Unit 3) commenced on May 28, 2011. CHASNUPP-III joined the nation's electricity grid system on October 15, 2016 and commenced its operations on December 6, 2016. It was officially inaugurated on December 28, 2016. Construction of CHASNUPP-IV (also known as C4 or Unit 4) started on December 18, 2011. CHASNUPP-IV was connected to nation's grid system on June 25, 2017 and it commenced its operations on September 19, 2017.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank buyer's credit loan for Units 3 and 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the buyer's credit loan agreement for Units 3 and 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. Then, on November 19, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE1-038]. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2021 under the buyer's credit loan agreement for the Units 3 and 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. Then, on or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 under the buyer's credit loan agreement for Units 3 and 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. Then, in April 2022, local media reported that the operation of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant and the repayment of the China Eximbank loans that supported its construction had become a challenge due the absence of requisite payments from the Government of Pakistan's Central Power Purchasing Agency–Guaranteed (CPPA-G).

70753,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides $70.28 million preferential buyer’s credit for the Darawat Dam Project (Linked to Project ID#35904),"In 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a $70.28 million preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement for the Darawat Dam Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. The purpose of the project was to construct the Darawat dam, which is located on the Nai Baran River near Jhangri village in Jamshoro District and Sindh Province. Its locational coordinates are 25°24′33.4″N 67°56′33.3″E. Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation.

The project completion ceremony took place on March 9, 2013.","1. The Chinese project title is 达瓦特大坝.  2. One WAPDA source suggests that the China Eximbank loan may have covered 90% of the total project cost. 3. Some sources also refer to this dam as the 'Darwat Dam'. 4. This project is related to a 2009 pledged line of credit for small dams in Pakistan (captured via Project ID#35904).5. The total cost of the EPC contract awarded to Sinohydro was 7.555 billion Pakistani rupees, and preferential buyer’s credits from China Eximbank typically cover 85% of the total cost of a project, so AidData estimates that the face value of the (USD-denominated) China Eximbank PBC for the Darawat Dam project was 6.42175 billion Pakistani rupee. Based on the average Pakistani rupee to USD exchange rate in 2010 (86.05 PKR = 1 USD), the estimated USD value of the preferential buyer’s credit from China Eximbank was $74,628,123. However, Pakistan's Ministry of Finance records the face value of the loan as $70,280,000. The official value is recorded as the transaction (financial commitment) amount for the time being. This issue warrants further investigation.","# Sector
