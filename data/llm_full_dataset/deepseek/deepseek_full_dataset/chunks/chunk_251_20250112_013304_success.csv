The project’s feasibility study was approved in the July 2017. A PPP compliance certificate was also issued for the project in July 2017. Then, in December 2017, Nigeria’s Federal Executive Council (FEC) approved the project.  In 2020, NNPC signed a $2,456,944,166.11 syndicated loan agreement with Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) for the Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano Gas Pipeline Project. Bank of China’s contribution is captured via Project ID#67052 and ICBC’s contribution is captured via Project ID#67051. The estimated borrowing terms of the loan are as follows: a 12-year maturity, a 3-year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3.75% margin, and a 7% Sinosure insurance premium. The Federal Government of Nigeria issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan (in January 2020), which accounts for 85% of the total project cost ($2,890,522,548.36). The Nigerian Gas Company — a subsidiary of NNPC — agreed to cover the remaining 15% of the project cost ($433,578,382.25) through an equity contribution.  According to the Government of Nigeria's Debt Management Office, '[t]he [Federal Government of Nigeria's] Contingent Liabilities increased in the 2020 due to the inclusion of the Contingent Liabilities arising from the Federal Government of Nigeria guarantee issued in respect of the NNPC-AKK Gas Pipeline Project executed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).'  The proceeds of the loan are to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract between NNPC and a consortium consisting of Brentex Petroleum Services Ltd and China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering Co Ltd (CPP), which was awarded on April 27, 2017 and signed on April 10, 2018. The borrower is expected to repay the loan through a pipeline transmission tariff.   The purpose of the project is to build a 614 km pipeline that will carry natural gas between the southern and northern parts of Nigeria. The pipeline will originate at the Ajaokuta terminal gas station (TGS) in the Kogi state in southern Nigeria and pass through Niger, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), and Kaduna to terminate at a gas station at Kano. The pipeline will cross seven major rivers and ten major roads along its route. The AKK pipeline project is divided into four segments. The first segment will run from Ajaokuta to Abuja in the FCT for a total distance of approximately 200 km. The second segment will extend for 193 km from the Abuja TGS to the Kaduna TGS, while the third segment will stretch for 97km from Kaduna to Zaria, and the fourth and final section of the pipeline will run for approximately 124km from Zaria to the Kano TGS. The pipeline will comprise 40 inch-diameter pipe joints and operate at a pressure of 1,000 pounds per square inch (PSIG). The Ajaokuta–Kaduna–Kano (AKK) pipeline will transport up to 3,500 million cubic feet (mcf) of gas a day from various gas gathering projects in southern Nigeria. Hydrocarbon liquids will be processed at Ajaokuta to produce liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), while the remaining gas will be transported to supply feedstock for new power plants and petrochemical facilities at Abuja, Kaduna, Kano, and Katsina.

92104,ENERGY,Bank of China contributes to $3 billion loan for the Nigeria LNG Complex Train 7 Expansion Project (Linked to Project ID#92103),"On May 13, 2020, Nigeria LNG Limited (NLNG) — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (49% equity stake), Shell (25.6% equity stake), Total (15% equity stake), and Eni (10.4% equity stake) — signed a $3 billion debt financing package with a syndicate of banks for the Nigeria LNG Complex Train 7 Expansion Project. The debt financing package consisted of a $1.5 billion covered tranche with Korea Trade Insurance Corporation (KSure), the Korea Export-Import Bank (K-EXIM), and SACE, and another $1.5 billion uncovered tranche with 26 International and Nigerian lenders (including Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China). Bank of China’s contribution is captured via Project ID#92104 and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China’s contribution is captured via Project ID#92103. The uncovered tranche carried the following borrowing terms: a 9-year maturity, 4-year grace period, and interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3.75% margin. Lenders will rely on NLNG's balance sheet and will have no direct recourse to NLNG's shareholders.   The proceeds of the loan are to be used by the borrower to finance FEED and EPC contracts, which were awarded to two separate consortia in August 2018. The purpose of the project is to add approximately eight million tons per annum of LNG at the Bonny Island LNG Complex in Nigeria. Currently six LNG trains produce an annual total of 22 million tons at the Bonny Island LNG Complex, which is expected to rise to 30 million tonnes when Train 7 is put into operation. Saipem, Chiyoda, and Daewoo E&C are the contractors responsible for implementation. NLNG Train 7 is expected to take five years to construct.","1. The lenders were advised by White & Case. The sponsors mandated two financial advisers earlier this year: SMBC and Guaranty Trust Bank. 2. This project is also known as the Train 7 Expansion Project. 3. The borrowing institution is also known as Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) Limited. 4. Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation is a state-owned oil company in Nigeria. 5. Some sources refer to the total size of the debt financing package as $2.77 billion rather than $3 billion. 6. AidData has estimated the all-interest interest rate by adding 3.75% to the average 6-month LIBOR rate in May 2020 (0.627%). 7. Two DFIs—the Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) and the African Export-Import Bank (Afrexim) — were also involved in this transaction, but their precise roles are unknown. This issue warrants further investigation. 8. The size of Bank and China and ICBC’s contributions to the $1.5 billion uncovered, syndicated loan tranche are unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes equal contributions from all 26 lenders that participated in the tranche ($57,692,307)","# Sector
