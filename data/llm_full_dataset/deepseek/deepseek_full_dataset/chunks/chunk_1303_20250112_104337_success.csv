32192,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides RMB 3.53 billion overseas investment loan for 246 MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project,"On January 18, 2017, China National Heavy Machinery Corporation (CHMC) and the Cambodian Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) signed a feasibility study agreement regarding the 246 MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. The feasibility report was completed in June 2007. It was conducted by two Chinese firms: China Jikan Research Institute of Engineering Investigations and Design Co., Ltd. and Powerchina Northwest Engineering Corporation Limited. The feasibility report was then reviewed in September 2007 by a group of experts organized by China Hydropower Engineering Consulting Group Co. (CHECC) — a subsidiary of China Electric Power Construction Group Co., Ltd. — and again in February 2008 by Cambodia’s MME. Then, in June 2008, China National Heavy Machinery Corporation (CHMC) and the Cambodian Government signed a build-operate and transfer (BOT) agreement regarding the 246MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project.   The 42 year agreement includes a 5-year construction period (1 year for preparation and 4 years for construction) and a 37-year operating period. In addition, an execution agreement, power purchase agreement (PPA), and BOT land lease agreement were signed by CHMC, Cambodia’s Ministry of Economy and Finance, Cambodia’s MME, and Electricité du Cambodge (EDC) — a Cambodian state-owned power company — in June 2008. On November 17, 2008, China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) issued a letter of interest, which conveyed its willingness to provide insurance for the $540 million project. Two months later, on January 12, 2009, China Eximbank issued a letter of interest, which conveyed its willingness to provide a loan for the 246 MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. Then, in August 2009, China’s National Development and Reform Commission formally approved CHMC’s investment in the 246MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project, which enabled China Eximbank to grant credit support to the project.   On June 9, 2010, China Eximbank and Cambodian Tatay Hydropower Limited (CTHL or 柬埔寨達岱水電有限公司) — a special purpose vehicle and project company that is wholly owned by another special purpose vehicle called Beijing Sanlian International Investment Co., Ltd., which in turn is owned by China National Heavy Machinery Corporation (93.13% equity stake) and CHINT Group (6.88% equity stake) — signed an overseas investment loan (境外投资贷款) agreement worth RMB 3,533,622,000 for the 246 MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. The loan was issued in three tranches worth RMB 1,349,831,300, RMB 1,195,191,300, and RMB 988,599,400 yuan, respectively. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. The parties also signed a mortgage agreement, stipulating that CTHL would provide a mortgage guarantee for all its properties (tangible or intangible) and all rights (existing or in the future) to China Eximbank. Sinosure also provided insurance for the overseas investment loan.   The proceeds of the China Eximbank loan were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial (EPC) contract that it signed with China Gezhouba Group Company Limited (CGGC) on February 10, 2010. The purpose of the project was to construct a hydroelectric power plant with a new reservoir (whose water surface area is 16,000,000m2 with a power density of 15.375W/m2) downstream of the Tatay River in Thma Bang District and Koh Kong Province and thereby generate power from clean renewable hydropower in Koh Kong Province and contribute to the sustainability of the Phnom Penh Power Grid. It involved the installation of 3 sets of turbine and generators (3×82MW), which amount to a total capacity of 246MW and a total net electricity supply of 857,300MWh (to be sold to the Phnom Penh Power Grid). It relied upon technology manufactured by Zhejiang Fuchunjiang Hydropower Equipments Co., Ltd in China.   The project was a diversion type hydropower station. Two dams were constructed to form a new reservoir. The concrete face rock-fill dam was located on the main stream of Tatay river and the auxiliary dam was located in Stung Kep River which is a tributary of the Tatay River. The three-opening bank spillway was located on the left bank of the Stung Kep River. The headrace power system and the river-side ground powerhouse were located at the left bank of the Tatay River; access roads to the dam crest and project site were provided on the left bank. The maximum height of the main dam located on the main stream was 110 meters, and the maximum height of the dam located on the Stung Kep River was 77 meters. A new reservoir was formed with the water surface of 16,000,000m2 and the power density is 15.375W/m2 . The designed net water head for the power generation was 188 meters. The power generated by the plant was to be routed to the 230kV O-Saom Substation though a 65km 230kV transmission line to Phnom Penh power grid. The project required the excavation of 7 million m3 of earth and 900,000 m3 of stone, for an active water storage capacity estimated at 322 m3 and an overall reservoir capacity of 439 million m3.   The project is located in Thmabang District within Koh Kong (Khétt Kaôh Kông) Province, which has central geographical coordinates at powerhouse: 103°10′11″E, 11°35′23″N; dam on Tatay River: 103°15′44″E, 11°37′46″N (i.e. powerhouse: 103.1697°E, 11.5897°N; dam on Tatay River: 103.2622°E, 11.6294°N). The dam site of the proposed project is 1.4 km upstream of the junction between Tatay River and its tributary named Stung Kep and 40km away from Koh Kong City, the capital of Koh Kong Province. China Gezhouba Group Company Limited (CGGC or 中国葛洲坝集团股份有限公司) was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, Zhejiang Fuchunjiang Hydropower Equipment Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Zhefu Holding Group Ltd., was a subcontractor responsible for the dam’s three 82MW generators.    In June 2009, preliminary results from the project’s environmental impact assessment (EIA), conducted by Key Consultants Cambodia (KCC) on behalf of CTHL, were released at a public forum. The full EIA was completed in September 2010. Then, in February 2010, it was announced that CGGC had won the construction contract bid. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on May 21, 2009; however, construction did not begin until March 29, 2010. Then, on November 5, 2010, Mr. Li Ruogu, President of China Eximbank conducted a project site inspection. The main dam was finished before the 2011 rainy season, and the auxiliary dam and spillway capacity were completed one year later. The main dam was finished before the 2011 rainy season, and the auxiliary dam and spillway capacity were completed one year later. In 2012, the European consulting firm Pöyry accepted a two-year contract with CTHL to provide monitoring of dam engineering, design, construction, quality, materials, and safety until 2014. As of February 8, 2012, construction was reportedly 20% complete. The access tunnel was completed in February 2013. Then, on June 23, 2013, Cambodia experienced 50-year monsoonal rains, flooding the project and suspending much of the construction. CHMC quickly deployed rescue workers to move construction equipment and build dikes. By the next day, the flood was under control and the damage contained. By the fall of 2013, the main dam passed the gate-closing requirements as determined by a Chinese team of experts and reviewed by Pöyry. After approval, the gate was closed and water storage officially began on November 16, 2013. The diversion tunnels for both dams were also finished in November 2013.   The originally expected project completion date was November 30, 2013; however, the first of the dam’s three 82MW generators did not begin to produce electricity until August 13, 2014. CHMC Board Chairman and President Mr. Lu Wenjun, and Mr. Zhu Xu attended a grid connection and commissioning ceremony on August 13, 2014. By December 2015, all three 82MW generators were active and the dam was fully operational. A project acceptance and power generation ceremony took place on December 23, 2015. The ceremony was attended by both Prime Minister Hun Sen and Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Bu Jianguo. Then, in November 2019, China Eximbank conducted an on-site, post-loan inspection. Under terms of a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), China National Heavy Machinery Corporation (CHMC), the majority shareholder of project owner and operator CTHL’s parent company, sells the electricity generated by the power plant at 7.45 cents per kilowatt-hour to EDC, thereby generating approximately $12 million of tax revenue a year. All electric power generated by the hydropower station is sent to the Phnom Penh-Battambang transmission and distribution lines. Since operationalization, the dam’s three generators have had an average annual production capacity of 849 GW*h14 that, in 2020, represented almost 24 percent of Cambodia’s total hydropower generation (3,493 GW*h) and 10 percent of Cambodia’s total domestic electricity production (8,513 GW*h). The 246MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project qualified for Certified Emission Reduction (CER) credits via the CDM under the UNFCCC as a renewable power source. The CDM credit system projected the dam would provide an annual greenhouse gas emission reduction of 393,329 tons of CO2 equivalents. The CER credits guaranteed by the project were then sold to the Netherlands via Gazprom Marketing & Trading Singapore between September 2013 and 2020. The project was recently re-certified by Shenzhen CTI International Certification to allow the same credits to be sold to the Netherlands for the next seven years between September 2020 to August 2027.","1.

32208,ENERGY,Bank of China provides $54.5 million loan for Phase 1 of the CIIDG–Huadian Sihanoukville Coal Power Plant Project (Linked to Project ID#39019),"On April 26, 2011, the Government of Cambodia and Cambodia International Investment Development Group signed an Implementation Agreement (IA) regarding Phase 1 of the CIIDG–Huadian Sihanoukville Coal Power Plant. Under the terms of the agreement, Cambodia International Investment Development Group agreed to implement Phase 1 of the CIIDG–Huadian Sihanoukville Coal Power Plant according to a 33-year build-own-operate (BOO) scheme. On the same day, Cambodia International Investment Development Group and Électricité du Cambodge (EDC) signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Then, on June 9, 2011, the Government of Cambodia agreed to guarantee the payment (power purchase) obligations of EDC and Cambodia’s Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy to Cambodia International Investment Development Group Co., Ltd. under the PPA and the IA.  On or around May 8, 2012, the Phnom Penh Branch of Bank of China Limited signed a $54,500,000 loan agreement with CIIDG Erdos Hongjun Electric Power Company Limited (CIIDG 鄂尔多斯鸿骏电力有限公司) — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of Cambodia International Investment Development Group (49% equity stake) and Inner Mongolia Erdos Hongjun Electric Power Company Limited (51% equity stake) — for Phase 1 of the CIIDG–Huadian Sihanoukville Coal Power Plant.   The purpose of Phase 1 was to construct a 405 MW coal-fired power plant — with three 135 MW generators — in Village 2, Kampenh Commune, Stung Hav District, and Preah Sihanouk Province (exact locational coordinates: 10.7325567, 103.5834703). Inner Mongolia Electric Power Survey and Design Institute Co. Ltd and Tianjin Research Institute for Water Transport Engineering were responsible for project design. Northwest No. 3 Electrical Power Construction Company was involved in the construction and installation of the 3 × 135 MW generating units. CCCC First Harbour Engineering Co. Ltd was involved in the construction of two 20,000-tonne bulk cargo berths and jetty for offloading coal. China MCC5 Group Corporation was involved in the guilding and installation of boiler-supporting frame structure.   Construction began on January 1, 2012. Unit #1 and Unit #2 were separately put into the commercial operation on November 14, 2014 and March 19, 2015, respectively. Unit #3 was put into commercial operation in 2017.  Residents in the area reportedly suffered due to improper handling of coal ash waste from the CIIDG–Huadian Sihanoukville Coal Power Plant and two other nearby plants. Since the 405 MW of Phase 1 connected to the grid in 2017, there has been no news on Phase 2 (which would have involved four more 135 MW generators). The Phase 2 plan seems to have been abandoned. In 2016, it was reported that the plant would power a nearby aluminum factory, but no such factory existed as of September 2021.","1. This project is also known as the CIIDG 1 Project. The Chinese project title is 西哈努克港7×135W燃煤电厂 or CIIDG 鄂尔多斯鸿骏西哈努克燃煤电厂项目 . 2. CIIDG is a local conglomerate, which, according to the Cambodian company register, is owned by the wife and children of Cambodian Senator Lao Meng Khin. CIIDG is linked to several energy-generation and transmission projects, including the CIIDG–Huadian Sihanoukville Coal Power Plant, which is adjacent to this project. When it was registered, Inner Mongolia Erdos Hongjun Investment Company Limited (内蒙古鄂尔多斯鸿骏投资有限公司) was 50% owned by the Erdos Group (内蒙古鄂尔多斯投资控股集团有限公司), a private enterprise from Inner Mongolia, and 50% by Qingdao Dezheng Resources Holding Company Limited(德正资源控股有限公司). The latter company was involved in a corruption scandal in China resulting in its chairman, Chen Jihong, being imprisoned for 23 years in 2018. In 2016 Erdos Group acquired the 50% stake from Dezhang and is now the 100% owner. However, Cambodia’s company register still lists Chen as a director of CIIDG Erdos. 3. The total cost of Phase 1 was reportedly $383 million. It seems very unlikely that a $383 million was finance with only $54.5 million of debt. This issue warrants further investigation.","# Sector
