The PBC carries the following borrowing terms: a 21.25 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0.75% commitment fee, and a 1% management fee. The total project cost is $273 million. China Eximbank covered 95% of the total project cost and the Government of Ghana covered the remaining 5% ($13 million).   The Government of Ghana used proceeds from the PBC to on-lend to Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL), a Ghanaian state-owned company, a Ghanaian state-owned enterprise. To this end, the Government of Ghana signed a $276,250,000 subsidiary loan agreement with the GWCL on August 25, 2015. The subsidiary loan carries a 15 year maturity and a 2% interest rate.    The (principal) amount outstanding under the China Eixmbnak loan (PBC) was GHS 991,940,000 ($177,132,142) as of December 31, 2020 and GHS 933,500,000 ($179,519,230) as of December 31, 2021.   The purpose of the Kpong Water Expansion Supply Project was to increase the supply of water from Kpong Head Works to Accra and Tema and thereby improve the reliability of potable water delivery to domestic, commercial and industrial customers. It involved construction of a new 353,000 m3 per day intake, expansion of treatment plant to 250,000 m3 per day and construction of new transmission mains through Dodowa, Adenta to Accra Booster Station. Other works involved the provision of dedicated electricity supply, distribution improvement and construction of terminal reservoirs at Madina, Boi and Okpong.    The project was implemented in 3 phases. Phase 1 involved the construction of a new intake and water pumping station for bulk water supply from Kpong with capacity of 196,000 cubic meters per day. Phase 2 involved  the construction of a new treatment plant of 186,000 cubic meters or 41 million gallons a day. Phase 3 involved the construction of new treated water pumping station as well as a pressure transmission (mains) system from Kpong to Accra through Oyibi to terminate at Okponglo (a suburb of Accra). The project beneficiary areas included Adenta, Madina, Kwabenya, Ashongman, North Legon, East Legon, West Legon, Ashaley Botwe, Haatso, Boi, Asofaa, Dome and surrounding areas.   China Gezhouba Water and Power Group Company Limited was the contractor responsible for implementation. Its work was overseen by Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL).

The originally scheduled contractual completion date was June 2015. In 2019, Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL) was reportedly negotiating a $373,000,000 loan agreement with China Eximbank to fund the second phase of this project (captured via Project ID#91808).
