It was expected that the cancellation of debts would help Togo achieve its Millennium Development Goals.","AidData has assumed based on numerous reports in English, French, and Chinese that indicate that the debt was formally cancelled in May 2012 that the agreement signed in October 2011 was a pledge of some kind, such as a memorandum of understanding, to cancel debt, and not the formal cancellation agreement. One source suggests the value of the debts that were forgiven was actually RMB 99,913,900 rather than RMB 100,000,000. This debt forgiveness project is not marked as an umbrella project since the original loans were contracted before 2000, so there is no risk of double counting.","# Sector
