34848,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides $25.423 million buyer’s credit loan for 220Kv Capanda-Lucala-N'dalatando Transmission Line Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#42029),"On November 28, 2003, the Chinese Government and the Angolan Government signed a framework agreement pertaining to a special economic cooperation arrangement (Agreement name in Chinese: 中华人民共和国商务部与安哥拉共和国财政部关于两国经贸合作特殊安排的框架协议).  Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility,  carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections.

The proceeds of the loan were used to partially finance a $28,248,625.00 commercial (EPC) contract with China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC), which was signed on March 10, 2005.    The purpose of the project was to construct a 220Kv electricity transmission line from Capanda to N’dalatando via Lucala.  CMEC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. The EPC contract for the project was originally scheduled to go into effect on November 8, 2005 and the originally scheduled handover date was July 31, 2007.

The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.

The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.

In March 2005, China Eximbank and the Government of Angola signed a $19,385,342.10 subsidiary buyer’s credit loan agreement under the MLFA for the Caxito, Catete, and Uige Water Supply System Rehabilitation Project. The proceeds of the loan were used to partially finance a $21,539,269.00 commercial (EPC) contract with China National Electronics Import & Export Corporation (CEIEC), which was signed on March 9, 2005.    The purpose of the project was to rehabilitate water supply systems in the town of Caxito, the town of Catete, and the city of Uige.

The proceeds of the loan were used to partially finance a $211,684,100.65 commercial (EPC) contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), which was signed on February 8, 2005.  This project also received a supplementary $50,702,850.00 loan from China Eximbank through a $500 million MLFA (as captured via Project ID#34030) extended to the Government of Angola on July 19, 2007.  This subsidiary loan carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee. The proceeds of the loan were used to partially finance a supplementary commercial contract with CRBC worth $56,336,500.00.    Project ID#34853 captures the first loan, and Project ID#66 captures the second, supplementary loan.  The purpose of this project, which employed 1336 Angolan workers and 367 Chinese workers, was the rehabilitation of a 357 km highway between Quifangondo and Negage via Caxito and Uige. The starting point of the road is in the town of Kifangondo, a northern suburb of Luanda City.  It extends northward through the city of Caxito, the capital of Bengo Province and the city of Uige, the capital of Uige Province.  The road terminates in the city of Negage, an important agricultural town within Uige Province.  CRBC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. The EPC contract supporting the project went into effect on December 13, 2005 and the originally expected project handover date was June 30, 2008.  The project officially commenced on December 13, 2005 and a project handover ceremony took place on August 30, 2008.
