85211,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",CNPC disburses $33 billion loan — via oil prepayment facility — to Rosneft for unspecified purposes,"On June 21, 2013, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and Rosneft — a Russian state-owned oil company — signed a $270 billion oil supply contract to increase oil deliveries to China under the condition of advance payment. The contract went into effect in late December 2013 after it was ratified by Russian law (Federal Law #352-FZ), passed by the Russian State Duma on December 10, 2013, approved by the country's Federal Council on December 18, 2013, and signed by the President of Russian Federation on December 20, 2013. Under the terms of the contract, Rosneft agreed to increase its supply of oil to China through the Russia-China Crude Pipeline (Eastern Route) by approximately 360 million tons — from 15 million tons per year in 2013 to 30 million tons per year by 2018. The term of the oil supply contract was 25 years, with the option of a 5-year extension. According to the terms of the contract, CNPC agreed to pay $60-70 billion in advance to Rosneft. Rosneft, in turn, agreed to repay CNPC at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 229 basis points. The $60-70 billion advance payment was scheduled to disburse in five tranches.   Multiple sources confirm that the first three tranches — worth approximately $33 billion — disbursed between 2013 and 2015. However, since it is unclear if the fourth or fifth tranches ever disbursed, AidData records the transaction amount as $33 billion for the time being. It is also unclear how the borrower used the proceeds of the loan, but at the time that the CNPC-Rosneft oil prepayment contract was announced in 2013, JP Morgan analysts told Reuters that ‘if confirmed, this would be a transformational event for the company's balance sheet: Rosneft could even potentially be able to show a net cash position, though working capital would be negative. The prepayment could minimize financing risks for the leveraged state-controlled oil company.","1. The Chinese project title is 罗斯向中国增供原油长期贸易合同. 2. Oil prepayment contracts are also known as pre-export finance (PXF) facilities. A PXF facility is an arrangement in which a commodity (e.g. oil) producer gets up-front cash from a customer in return for a promise to repay the customer with that commodity (possibly at a discount) in the future. PXF funds may be advanced by a lender or syndicate of lenders to a commodity producer to assist the company in meeting either its working capital needs (for example, to cover the purchase of raw materials and costs associated with processing, storage and transport) or its capital investment needs (for example, investment in plant and machinery and other elements of infrastructure). PXF facilities are usually secured by (1) an assignment of rights by the producer under an ‘offtake contract’ (i.e., a sale and purchase contract between the producer and a buyer of that producer of goods or commodities), and (2) a collection account charge over a bank account into which proceeds due to the producer from the buyer of the goods or commodities under the offtake contract are credited. There are two key documents in prepayment finance transactions: a contract providing for the advance payment by the offtaker to the producer for the purchase of goods/commodities (the 'Prepayment Contract'), and a loan agreement between a lender and the offtaker (the 'Offtaker Loan Agreement') under which the advance payment is financed. Due to to various international sanctions imposed upon Russia, PXF facilities are one of the fews ways in which commodity producers (borrowers) can borrow in foreign currency. 3. The interest rate that applies to the CNPC-Rosneft oil prepayment contract (2.421%) was calculated by taking the average 6-month LIBOR rate during the month (June 2013) when the contract finalized (0.131%) and adding a 2.29% margin. 4. In financial reports published by Rosneft (e.g. https://www.rosneft.ru/upload/site1/document_file/rep8_EZHO_1kv2021.pdf), the lender is identified as China National United Oil Corporation, which is a subsidiary of CNPC.","# Sector

# Description
In November 2013, a syndicate of 11 banks — including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (BOC) — signed a $250 million USD syndicated pre-export credit facility agreement with ZAO Russian Copper Company (RCC) (RMK) — a Russian copper producer whose majority shareholder is Russian billionaire Igor Altushkin — for refinancing and working capital purposes.

98534,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,ICBC Leasing provides $800 million facility to State Transport Leasing Company for the acquisition of five Airbus A321s and three Boeing 777-300E aircraft,"In 2013, ICBC Financial Leasing Co., Ltd. (ICBCFL) entered into a $800 million facility agreement with PJSC State Transport Leasing Company (STLC) (GTLK) — a Russian state-owned leasing company — to finance the procurement of five Airbus A321s and three Boeing 777-300ERs for Russian airline Aeroflot. The lessors under the corresponding financial lease agreements are Sky High XXVI Leasing Company Limited and Sky High XLII Leasing Company Limited, companies controlled by ICBCFL. All of the aircraft were transferred to Aeroflot successfully.  As a consequence of the February 24, 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Western government issued a number of sanctions on the Russian aviation and airline industry. As a result, a number of leasing companies cancelled their lease agreements with Russian airliners. Despite the cancellations, Russia acted to seize the leased aircraft to maintain a fleet of air-worthy aircraft and prevent foreign currency outflows (since leasing contracts are denominated in United States dollars) in violation of the Cape Town Convention, an international treaty that stipulates the return of leased aircraft to their owners when contracts are cancelled. On March 14, 2022, after the beginning of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia passed a law to allow foreign-registered aircraft owned by non-Russian lessors to be placed on the Russian registry, making it likely that leasing companies would be unable to recover their assets. Three Airbus A321-211 aircraft owned by ICBC Leasing — possibly amongst the five leased under the 2013 agreement to Aeroflot or amongst the six leased under a 2016 agreement to Aeroflot (Project ID#98575) — were re-registered in Russia, making it likely that ICBC Leasing would fail to recover its aircraft.","1. AidData treats this lease as a loan. A lease is a contractual arrangement calling for the lessee (user) to pay the lessor (owner) for use of an asset. The lessor is the legal owner of the asset, while the lessee obtains the right to use the asset in return for regular rental payments. Under a capital lease (a financial arrangement where the lessee/borrower uses an asset and pays regular installments plus interest to the lender/lessor), rental payments are usually classified as interest and obligation payments, similarly to a mortgage (with the interest calculated each rental period on the outstanding obligation balance).2. There is some evidence that the financing of the acquisition of the Boeing 777-300ERs was a later addition. On October 13, 2014, ICBCFL, STLC, and Aeroflot signed an agreement for the financing and leasing of three new Boeing 777-300ER planes. The aircraft were to be delivered in the first half of 2015 and then handed over to Aeroflot. The first aircraft arrived in March 2015.  The monetary value of the October 13, 2014 financial agreement is unknown. However, it is known that a new Boeing 777-300ER costs around $320.2 million per plane. This issue warrants further investigation. 3. ICBC Financial Leasing Co. Ltd. is a subsidiary of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC).","# Sector
