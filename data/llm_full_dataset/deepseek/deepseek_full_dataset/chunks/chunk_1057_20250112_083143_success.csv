The complex includes two units for processing and husking, cleaning, bleaching of packaging and equipment, and three silos for storage (two of them for 3,000 tons of rice and one for 2,000 tons of corn).

The first three years of the contract period were used to clear land, build infrastructure, and conduct plant experimentation; subsequently, the final two years of the contract were used to train Angolan farmers in technology and land management. The overall objective of the project was to promote rice production in the country and reduce cereal imports.
