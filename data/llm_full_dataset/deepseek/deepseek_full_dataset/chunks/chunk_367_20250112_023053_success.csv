30578,"AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY, FISHING",China Development Bank provides $185.57 million loan for Ghana Coastal Fishing Landing Sites Project (Linked to Project ID#2034),"On December 16, 2011, China Development Bank and the Government of Ghana signed a $3 billion master facility agreement (captured via Project ID#2034). This agreement established two lending facilities: Tranche A and Tranche B. Tranche A is a $1.5 billion facility and any borrowings through this facility are undertaken with a 15 year maturity, 5 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.95% margin, a 0.25% upfront fee, and a 1% commitment fee. Tranche B is a $1.5 billion facility and any borrowings through this facility are undertaken with a 10 year maturity, 3 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.85% margin, and a 1% commitment fee. Both tranches are collateralized against cash proceeds from the sale of crude oil from the Jubilee field, which the borrower was required to deposit in a debt service reserve account (DSRA). The cash balance of the DSRA was GHS 370,586,909 ($71,266,713) in 2019.  [Note: A requirement of the master facility agreement was that the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC) and the China International United Petroleum and Chemicals Co. (UNIPEC Asia) sign an offtaker for the sale and purchase of crude oil. Under the terms of this agreement, GNPC agreed to supply and sell 13,000 barrels of crude oil from Jubilee Field each day to UNIPEC Asia over a 15.5 year period. The proceeds from these oil sales were then deposited into a special account to facilitate loan repayment and provide a source of collateral.]   Under the terms of the master facility agreement, subsidiary loan agreements must be negotiated to secure financial support for any given project. On April 17, 2019, China Development Bank and the Government of Ghana signed a subsidiary loan agreement worth $185,570,000 — using the Tranche B lending facility — for the Coastal Fishing Landing Sites Project. This project was originally identified as eligible for lending through the Tranche A facility; however, the Government of Ghana and CDB agreed to fund it through the Tranche B facility and shorten the maturity of the loan to ensure that the off-taker agreement did not extend beyond its current term. As such, the terms of lending for this project (9 year maturity, 3 year grace period, 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.85% margin, and a 1% commitment fee) were slightly different than the terms specified for lending through the Tranche B facility in the master facility agreement signed on December 16, 2011. The borrower was also responsible for paying a 5.56% (approximately $8.77 million) lump sum Sinosure premium and maintaining a minimum cash balance of 1.3 times the repayment amount for each six month cycle in a designated DSRA at all times. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $195,507,564.00 commercial contract [ID#GPHA-CHEC-11-FLS] between China Harbour Engineering Company Limited (CHEC) and Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority (GPHA), which was signed in August 2012 (and then amended on July, 6 2018). The Coastal Fishing Landing Sites Project involves the development of 12 coastal fishing ports and fish landing sites with related on-land facilities.   The (principal) amount outstanding under the Tranche B lending facility was GHS 1,505,360,000 ($268,814,285) as of December 31, 2020 and GHS 1,107,600,000 ($213,000,000) as of December 31, 2021.  These fishing ports, landing sites and related facilities are located in Axim and Dixcove in the Western Region, Otuam, Moree, Mumford, Winneba, Senya Beraku, Gomoa Fete and Elmina in the Central Region, Teshie and James Town in the Greater Accra Region, and Keta in the Volta Region. The facilities will include breakwater for a sheltered berthing and anchorage bay; quay walls for the berthing, loading/unloading of canoes and trawlers; navigational aids for the safe arrival and departure of canoes and trawlers; fish handling sheds for the transfer and sale of fresh fish under all weather conditions, ice blocks/crush making plant for the manufacture and sale of ice blocks of crushed blocks to fisherman; net mending and drying yards for fishermen to spread and mend or dry their nets; pre-mixed fuel supply yard for the installation of pre-mixed fuel tanks for sale of pre-mixed fuel to fishermen; canoe/trawler repair yard for the maintenance and repair of damaged vessels; maintenance and repair of outboard motors and marine engines yards; services to the fishing ports (e.g. roads, driveways, water and power supply, telephone lines); and port administration building to accommodate the port management and the staff of the Department of Fisheries.   CHEC is the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Its EPC contract specifies that construction was to commence within 56 days of the signing of the subsidiary loan agreement (April 17, 2019). A formal groundbreaking ceremony for this project took place at the Axim fishing port in the Western Region on July 24, 2019. However, project implementation did not begin until August 22, 2019. As of August 2020, construction of the revetment and breakwater at the Axim fishing port was ongoing and entering its final stage, with a target completion date of September 2020. As of August 2020, construction of an underwater quay wall at the Axim fishing port was also set to be completed in January 2021.   Other planned activities at the Axim fishing port include the construction of 9 buildings, including an administration building, fish market, net mending hall, ice making plant, workshop large, fuel depot, day care, toilet, and a power station. All of these activities were expected to reach completion by September 2021. As of August 2020, the various fishing port and landing sites had achieved the following completion rates: Axim 42.01%, Dixcove is 38.23%, Moree 37.52%, Mumford 38.57%, Winneba 8.88%, Senya 90.69%, Gomoa Fete 69.82%, Teshie 38.32% and Keta 5.25%.  There are some indications that the CDB loan for the Ghana Coastal Fishing Landing Sites Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the World Bank’s International Development Statistics, the Government of Ghana had accumulated principal and interest arrears to one or more official sector Chinese creditors worth $908,337,346.70) in 2020 ($763,228,526.60 in principal arrears and $145,108,820.10 in interest arrears).
