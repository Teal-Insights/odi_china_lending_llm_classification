61056,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",CDB provides $1.84 billion loan for Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project (Linked to Project ID#40241 and #61142),"In June 2009, China Development Bank (CDB) agreed to provide a $3 billion line of credit to JSC Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna (also known as ‘Samruk-Kazyna’). Borrowings through the line of credit were to be used for the development of infrastructure and resource projects in Kazakhstan. Then, on October 13, 2009, KAZ Minerals PLC (also known as ‘Kazakhmys Corporation LLC’ and ‘Kazakhmys’) announced that it was in discussions with CDB and Samruk-Kazyna regarding a major unsecured loan facility.  Following a memorandum of financial cooperation that was signed by Kazakhmys, Samruk-Kazyna and CDB on November 14, 2009, $2.7 billion from the $3 billion line of credit was allocated to various projects of KAZ Minerals PLC. Then, on December 30, 2009, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC (also known as Kazakhmys Finance PLC) — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals PLC — and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $2 billion facility (loan) agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project. On the same day, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $100 million facility (loan) agreement for the Bozymchak Copper and Gold Mine Development Project. Thirteen days later, on January 12, 2010, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project. Then, on June 11, 2012, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed two additional loan agreements: a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All five loan agreements (collectively worth $2.7 billion) were financed by Samruk-Kazyna via borrowings from the $3 billion CDB line of credit.  All of the loans carried the following borrowing terms: maturities of between 12 and 15 years (with final maturity dates falling between January 2022 and August 2025), 3 year grace periods (with the first loan repayment scheduled for January 2013), annual interest rates of LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin, and 1.5% management fees. A separate fee of $3 million was also payable under the loan agreements for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Project and the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All of the loans were also backed by repayment guarantees from KAZ Minerals PLC and a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna. All five loans reportedly disbursed in full by January 2013. The remaining $300 million under the $3 billion CDB line of credit was utilized (drawn down) by Samruk-Kazyna for an unknown purposes and fully repaid in January 2013. In January 2014, KAZ Minerals PLC fully repaid its loans for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project (since the development of these projects was no longer expected to commence in the near future). Then, on December 29, 2014, two of the loan agreements that KAZ Minerals Finance PLC had previously signed with Samruk-Kazyna (via on-lending from the CDB line of credit) were transformed into bilateral loan agreements with CDB: the loan agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project and the loan agreement for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project. At that time, the face value of the loan for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project was $1,844,000,000 (most likely because some repayments were made between January 2013 and December 2014) and the face value of the loan for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project was upsized to $148,500,000 (for an unknown reason). At that time the borrowing, terms of the two loans with outstanding balances were rescheduled.  The interest rate was lowered from LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin to LIBOR plus a 4.50% margin; and an arrangement fee of 0.5% was agreed upon, of which 60% was paid in December 2014 and 40% was paid in January 2016. The maturities and grace periods of the loan were left unchanged. KAZ Minerals PLC continued to serve as a guarantor for the loans. However, as an additional credit enhancement, the borrower pledged a $100,000,000 minimum cash balance in a charge account (collection account) as a source of collateral. The amended, bilateral loan (facility) agreements between CDB and KAZ Minerals also clarified that the loan proceeds were to be used by the borrower ‘principally for the development of the Bozshakol and Bozymchak [mine] projects.’ As of December 31, 2020, $1.0 billion was drawn down by the borrower under the $1,844,000,000 CDB loan agreement and the $148,500,000 CDB loan agreement. During 2020, the borrower made a $183 million repayment. An additional $181 million repayment was due in 2021. Both CDB loans are repayable in semi-annual installments each January and July with final maturity dates in August 2025.

CDB provides $300 million loan to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna

# Description
In June 2009, China Development Bank (CDB) agreed to provide a $3 billion line of credit to JSC Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna (also known as ‘Samruk-Kazyna’). Borrowings through the line of credit were to be used for the development of infrastructure and resource projects in Kazakhstan. Then, on October 13, 2009, KAZ Minerals PLC (also known as ‘Kazakhmys Corporation LLC’ and ‘Kazakhmys’) announced that it was in discussions with CDB and Samruk-Kazyna regarding a major unsecured loan facility. Following a memorandum of financial cooperation that was signed by Kazakhmys, Samruk-Kazyna and CDB on November 14, 2009, $2.7 billion from the $3 billion line of credit was allocated to various projects of KAZ Minerals PLC. Then, on December 30, 2009, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC (also known as Kazakhmys Finance PLC) — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals PLC — and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $2 billion facility (loan) agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project. On the same day, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $100 million facility (loan) agreement for the Bozymchak Copper and Gold Mine Development Project. Thirteen days later, on January 12, 2010, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project. Then, on June 11, 2012, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed two additional loan agreements: a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All five loan agreements (collectively worth $2.7 billion) were financed by Samruk-Kazyna via borrowings from the $3 billion CDB line of credit.  All of the loans carried the following borrowing terms: maturities of between 12 and 15 years (with final maturity dates falling between January 2022 and August 2025), 3 year grace periods (with the first loan repayment scheduled for January 2013), annual interest rates of LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin, and 1.5% management fees. A separate fee of $3 million was also payable under the loan agreements for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Project and the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All of the loans were also backed by repayment guarantees from KAZ Minerals PLC and a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna. All five loans reportedly disbursed in full by January 2013. The remaining $300 million under the $3 billion CDB line of credit was utilized (drawn down) by Samruk-Kazyna for an unknown purposes and fully repaid in January 2013. In January 2014, KAZ Minerals PLC fully repaid its loans for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project (since the development of these projects was no longer expected to commence in the near future). Then, on December 29, 2014, two of the loan agreements that KAZ Minerals Finance PLC had previously signed with Samruk-Kazyna (via on-lending from the CDB line of credit) were transformed into bilateral loan agreements with CDB: the loan agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project and the loan agreement for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project. At that time, the face value of the loan for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project was $1,844,000,000 (most likely because some repayments were made between January 2013 and December 2014) and the face value of the loan for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project was upsized to $148,500,000 (for an unknown reason). At that time the borrowing, terms of the two loans with outstanding balances were rescheduled.  The interest rate was lowered from LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin to LIBOR plus a 4.50% margin; and an arrangement fee of 0.5% was agreed upon, of which 60% was paid in December 2014 and 40% was paid in January 2016.

The face value of the loan was subsequently revised to RMB 1,026,923,076.92. The loan was provided with the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, an 8 year grace period, and a 20.25 year maturity (final maturity date: March 21, 2030).    The borrower made principal repayments worth RMB 41,076,923 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and RMB 82,153,846.16 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2020-2022).

The 50km highway is located in the northeast of the Nairobi Metropolitan Region (NMR) and it extends from Nairobi City Center to Thika District. The trunk road currently serves as a main cargo route and an important metropolitan, regional and international transit link and is part of the classified international trunk road A2, which originates in Nairobi City Center and extends to Moyale, Ethiopia. The road also acts as a main artery for various satellite towns and economic hubs that lie along and near the corridor, including Ruaraka, Kasarani, Kiambu Town, Githurai, Ruiru, Juja, and Thika.   The project consisted of 3 lots and it was co-financed by the African Development Bank, China Eximbank, and the Government of Kenya. China Eximbank funded Lot 3 (the 23.8 km road segment from Kenyatta University to Thika) and the African Development Bank and the Government of Kenya financed Lots 1 and 2. The first lot (Lot 1) comprised the rehabilitation and upgrading of three Nairobi City Arterial Connectors to the Nairobi - Thika Road (A2) for a total of 12.4 km. The components were: Forest Road from Pangani to A104 Museum Roundabout (3.6 km); Muranga Road from Muthaiga to A104 at University Way Roundabout (4.5 km); and Kariakor Road from Pangani to A104 at Haile Selasse Road Roundabout (4.3 km). The second lot (Lot 2) covered the rehabilitation and expansion of the 14.1 km Muthaiga - Kenyatta University stretch on the Nairobi - Thika road (km 3+900 - km 18 + 00). The third lot (Lot 3) involved the rehabilitation and upgrading of the 23.88 km Kenyatta University (km 18+000) to Thika (km 41+880) section of the road.   3 Chinese contractors were responsible for project implementation: Shengli, Sinohydro Corp and China Wu Yi. China Wu Yi worked on Lot 1, Sinohydro worked on Lot 2, and Shengli worked on Lot 3. The project was initiated on January 22, 2009, and completed on October 11, 2011. The project was originally expected to reach completion, as per the project implementation schedule, on July 21, 2011.    This project was designed with a robust monitoring and evaluation mechanism. Baseline data collected at the beginning of the project were compared with enplane data collected at project at completion. The indicators are largely “SMART”: measures of mobility assessed through changes in traffic flows; accessibility, tracked using journey speed survey data at the beginning and at completion of the project; increased inter-regional trade flows between Eastern Africa and the Horn of Africa, measured through secondary economic data in 2007 and assessed against target flows in 2011; traffic accident data in 2007 assessed against crash data in 2013; and average land values within the project corridor measured before and after the project. The outcome data at project completion were impressive: traffic flows increased from 85,000 vehicles per day in 2007 to 123,000 vehicles per day in 2012 (45% increase in mobility); journey speeds rose from 8km/hour to at least 45km/hour in sections with the highest registered traffic; the number of traffic accidents fell; and land values rose from $23 thousand to $46 thousand per acre in Thika, and even more in areas closer to the city like Kasarani—from $46 thousand up to $500 thousand per acre.","1.

This project involved the construction of a 112-bed hospital on a 7012 square meters area located in Nasra Gardens within Embakasi District.  117 million KES of the grant proceeds were reportedly used to equip the hospital with modern equipment.  China Wuyi Company was the contractor responsible for implementation.  Construction began on June 30, 2009, and the project was officially handed over to the Kenyan authorities on August 5, 2011.  The hospital officially opened on February 26, 2013. It was eventually renamed the Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital Embakasi after Kenya's first lady, who chose the location for the hospital.","This project is also referred to as Mama Lucy Kibaki Hospital Construction Project and the New Kayole Hospital Construction Project. The Chinese project title is 建的肯尼亚东区医院项目. According to the Kenyan Aid Management Platform, by July 2010, 629,550,000 KES in grants had been disbursed for the project. See Project ID #60169 for a second grant made on July 1, 2010. Also, note that in the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020, it identifies this project as being funded by a $7 million Chinese Government loan. However, the Kenya Electronic Project Monitoring Information System (eProMIS) records the Chinese Government’s financial commitment as a grant, so AidData treats this project as a grant-funded project for the time being.","# Sector
