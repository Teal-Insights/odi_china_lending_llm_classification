40331,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides RMB 200 million government concessional loan for Gas Field Drilling Equipment Acquisition and Installation Project,"On July 20, 2005, the Chinese Government and the Government of Turkmenistan signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the Gas Field Drilling Equipment Acquisition and Installation Project. Then, on May 18, 2006, China Eximbank and the State Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs of Turkmenistan signed an RMB 200 million government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Gas Field Drilling Equipment Acquisition and Installation Project. The borrowing terms of the GCL are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was to use the proceeds of the GCL to finance an RMB 200 million commercial contract between China Petroleum Technology & Development Corporation (CPTDC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), and a Turkmen state-owned enterprise called “Turkmengeologiya.""   The purpose of this project was to facilitate (a) the design and construction of a water cooling and softening unit and pumping stations at the headworks-2 of the Dovletabat gas field-3; (b) the supply of component equipment for a Chinese-made ZJ70D drilling rig; (c) the supply of drilling equipment for the reconstruction of three Russian RUZD86 drilling rigs and the supply of one Chinese-made ZJ70D drilling rig for Turkmengeologiya; and (d) the supply of seven Chinese-made XJ250 lift units and spare parts for a Turkmen state-owned oil company called Turkmeneft (or Türkmennebit or TurkmenOil).   AidData has not identified any evidence of this project reaching implementation. However, in May 2016, Turkmengeologiya re-announced an international tender for the supply of off-site and drilling equipment (that would be financed with the proceeds of a concessional loan from the Chinese Government).","1. This project is also known as the Dauletabad-3 Gas Deposit Drilling Equipment Project, the Dowletabat-3 Gas Deposit Drilling Equipment Project, and the Daulatabad-3 Gas Deposit Drilling Equipment Project. The Russian project title is закупки современных пассажирских вагонов для Министерства железнодорожного транспорта Туркменистан. 2. The Dauletabad–Sarakhs–Khangiran pipeline (also known as Dauletabad–Salyp Yar pipeline) is a natural gas pipeline from the Dauletabad gas field in Turkmenistan to Khangiran in Iran, where it is connected with the Iran Gas Trunkline system. It is significant as it has allowed for the diversification of Turkmenistan's gas export routes, doubling the nation's export of gas to Iran.  The decision to build the pipeline was made in July 2009. The pipeline was completed in October 2009 and was inaugurated on January 6, 2010.  The total length of the pipeline is 182 km. It starts at the Dauletabad gas field where it branches off from the Dovletabad–Deryalyk pipeline (Central Asia – Center gas pipeline system). It runs 30.5 km (19.0 mi) to Sarakhs, where it crosses the Iran–Turkmenistan border. From there, the 35-km (22 mi) long section transports gas to the Shahid Hasheminejad (Khangiran) Gas Refinery in Khangiran, Khorasan Province.”","# Sector

Then, in June 2004, Turkmenistan’s Ministry of Telecommunications and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. signed an RMB 40 million ($4.8 million) commercial contract for Phase 1 of the Telecommunications Equipment Acquisition Project. The commercial contract was fully financed with the ETCA proceeds committed in December 2002.  In 2005, Turkmen Prime Minister Atamyrat Berdiyev announced that the Chinese Government was planning to give the Government of Turkmenistan another soft credit line worth RMB 650 million to carry out telecommunications projects (captured via Project #42014). Then, in April 2006, the Governments of Turkmenistan and the Chinese Government signed a preferential loan framework agreement that set out the terms and conditions of borrowing for these telecommunications project. In December 2006, the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank) and the Government of Turkmenistan signed an RMB 200 million government concessional loan for Phase 2 of a Telecommunications Equipment Acquisition Project (Project #40332). The exact borrowing terms are unknown.  Then, in 2009, China Eximbank and the Government of Turkmenistan signed an RMB 450 million government concessional loan for Phase 3 of a Telecommunications Equipment Acquisition Project (captured via Project #57778).  The purpose of Phase 1 was to establish a radio-telephone communication network in Ashgabat by modernizing inter-station communication links. Under the terms of its Phase 1 contract, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. also agreed to build build the Euro-Asian fiber cable’s extensions to Ashgabat, Anau, Yashlyk, Kaahka, Dushak and Tejen. Additionally, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. agreed to mount digital automatic telephone stations in Akhal and in Lebap regionvas well as a digital automatic telephone station in Turkmenabat.  The purpose of Phase 2 was to acquire telecommunication equipment and spare parts for the Ministry of Communications of Turkmenistan. The equipment was to be used for the the construction of digital automatic telephone exchanges (строительство новых цифровых АТС), the construction of Farap-Turkmenabat-Atamurat-Magdanly, Tejen-Serahs and Ashgabat-Dashoguz fiber-optic communication lines (волоконно-оптических линий связи «Фарап–Туркменабат–Атамурат–Магданлы» и «Теджен–Серахс» и «Ашхабад–Дашогуз»), the expansion of the capacity of the Turkmenistan's national cellular communication network (TM CELL) [расширение емкости Национальной сети сотовой связи «TM CELL»], and the expansion of CDMA radio access network (сети радиодоступа стандарта CDMA). Phase 2 involved the installation of 84 basic stations in Asgabat and other regions, including the installations of stations along the Turkmenbasy-Asgabat-Mary-Turkmenabat road, in order to meet Turkmenistan's growing demand for mobile communication. The number of users of the CDMA radio access network was expected to rise by 10,000 upon completion of Phase 2. 10 basic stations were to be installed in Asgabat and its suburbs, Coganly, Bekrewe, Bagyr and Bedew, and and in the Arcabil settlement, the town of Abadan, and in Gokdepe District. The fiber optic communication lines were to link the large and small towns of Turkmenistan, and the Farap-Turkmenabat-Atamyrat-Magdanly fibre-optic line was to be 450 kilometers upon completion. Once all the stations reached their full capacity, the new fibre-optic line was expected to provide high-quality digital communications for 14 large localities in the south of the Lebap Region. Additionally, the Tejen-Sarahs fibre-optic telecommunication main line was expected to be 130 kilometers long when it was done.  Phase 3 involved the acquisition of telecommunications equipment for Turkmenistan’s Ministry of Communications. According to a 2012 annual report published by the State Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs of Turkmenistan, Phase 3 entered implementation. However, its precise implementation start date is unknown.","AidData assumes that Phase 2 was completed since China Eximbank subsequently financed Phase 3.
