The purpose of the project was to construct a 34 km road section (D819) from Mongu to Tapo on the Mongu-Kalabo Road. It also involved the construction of twenty five bridges, the construction of 1022 meter bridges across Zambezi River, constructions of crushed stone base, bituminous surfacing, ancillaries like road markings, traffic signs, kilometer posts, guard rails, and erosion protection works.

For six months of the year the river would flood and you had to move north or south to a pontoon ferry. Each way it was a five-hour trip, just to get to the ferry. In the dry season, you could travel on the Zambezi, but it would take eight to ten hours on a banana boat with a 35 hp motor.’   A paved road through this section of the Western Province linking Zambia to Angola has been a dream for successive Zambian governments.

In 2011, the Chinese Government provided a RMB 50 million grant to the Government of Zimbabwe for the Amai Mugabe High School Construction Project.  This project involved the construction of Amai Mugabe High School (also known as Amai Mugabe Junior School), which is located in the village of Mazowe within Mashonaland Central Province.  The school was built on a 7,720 square meter plot and it included 27 classrooms (carrying 30 students each), a library, an art room, music room, computer room and auxiliary equipment rooms.  The school was designed to support four streams of 24 pupils per class from grade one to grade seven.  Upon completion, it was envisaged that the school would cater to 900 disadvantaged children from Grace Mugabe Children's Home and surrounding areas.  Anhui Foreign Economic Construction Co., Ltd. (AFECC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation.  A groundbreaking ceremony took place on 3 November, 2011. On 31 January, 2013, the project was officially completed and handed over the Zimbabwean authorities.  The handover certificate was accepted by Ignatius Chombo who, at the time, was Zimbabwe’s Acting Minister of Primary and Secondary Education.  The school officially opened its doors to the public on 8 January, 2014. This project is also known as the Grace Mugabe Foundation Primary School Construction Project and the Grace Mugabe Orphanage School Construction Project.",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,Social Development,Project is focused on education infrastructure with no direct environmental or energy transition impact,"Construction of school with classrooms, library, and specialized rooms; serves disadvantaged children"

Zimbabwean Vice President Joyce Mujuru signed the loan agreement in Harare. The loan agreement followed the signing of a 2010 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) by the Chinese Government and Government of Zimbabwe for the financing of various development projects. Officials from Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance, representatives from China Eximbank and Sinosure signed the MOU. Sinosure agreed to provide insurance cover for various loans issued by China Eximbank. The BCL that was issued on March 21, 2011 carried the following borrowing terms: an 11 year maturity, a 4 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3% margin, a 0.375% management fee, and a 0.375% commitment fee.    However, its face value was subsequently revised to $140,825,714.38. The purpose of this project was to support the development and rehabilitation of water works and sewers in the Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare. More specifically, the proceeds of the loan were to be used to rehabilitate, replace, install and commission equipment at the Morton Jaffray water treatment plant, the Prince Edward Water Treatment plant, the Crowborough sewage plant, the Firle sewage plant, and pump stations at Warren Control, Alex Park, and Letombo. Some of the loan proceeds were also earmarked for information technology and automated billing activities, the acquisition of water treatment chemicals, the installation of laboratory, the installation of pressure-reducing valves, and the installation of prepaid meters in 500,000 households.  China National Machinery and Equipment Corporation (CNMEC) was the contractor responsible for implementation of the project.     This project officially entered into force on January 26, 2013, but it was plagued by various delays and controversies. In 2013, China Eximbank reportedly withheld loan disbursements due to the Government of Zimbabwe’s failure to meet its outstanding obligation under a 1997 loan that it provided to Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Industries (See Project ID#17125). In September 2013, 19 Chinese engineers joined a larger 46 engineer team to work on the project. Then, in June 2014, the deadline for project completion was pushed forward from April 2016 to June 2015. As of June 2014, several areas previously not receiving water had access and obsolete equipment was removed from facilities, the Morton Jaffray water treatment plant was operating at 70 percent capacity, and two pressure-reducing valves were installed at Warren Park D and Ardbennie.   A month later, in July 2014, an investigation was launched after the Harare City Council was accused of spending $8 million of the loan proceeds to purchase 25 luxury vehicles. Harare City Council insisted that the vehicles were for service deliveries; however, China Eximbank decided to withhold loan disbursements after learning that the loan proceeds were not being used for the intended purposes. As of June 2017, only half of the China Eximbank loan (approximately $72 million) had been disbursed. As of February 2020, China Eximbank was still withholding loan disbursements for this project. There is also evidence that the Government of Zimbabwe has fallen behind on its loan repayment schedule. As of 2018, the borrower had accumulated principal and interest arrears and penalties worth $28,430,361.10.   Also, according to a report released by the Debt Management Office of Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance in mid-2022, the loan was still in arrears at the end of 2021.

At the time that the 2011 loan agreement for the Rehabilitation of Municipal Water and Sewage Treatment Works Project was presented to Zimbabwe’s Parliament for ratification, the maturity length of the loan was identified as 9 years, which implies that 2020 was final maturity date under the original loan agreement. However, in the 2019 Blue Book Estimates of Revenue and Expenditure published by Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, the final maturity date of the loan is identified as 2022, which implies an 11 year maturity.
