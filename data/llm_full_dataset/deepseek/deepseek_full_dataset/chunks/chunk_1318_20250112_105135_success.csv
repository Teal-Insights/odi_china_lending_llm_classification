684,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",ICBC provides $109.9 million buyer’s credit loan for Moanda Metallurgical Complex Construction Project,"On September 10, 2010, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and BNP Paribas signed a $157 million buyer’s credit loan agreement with Compagnie Minière de l'Ogooué (Comilog) for the Moanda Metallurgical Complex Construction Project. The Government of Gabon holds a 28.9% ownership stake in Comilog. The loan carries a 11.5 year maturity period, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR + a 4.3% margin (0.478% + 4.3% = 4.778%). ICBC provided 70% of the financing ($109.9 million) while BNP Paribas provide the remaining 30% ($47.1 million). BNP Paribas acted as the mandated lead arranger, facility agent and security agent.   The first loan disbursement was scheduled for April 2011, and loan repayments were scheduled over 16 equal and consecutive semi-annual installments (which implies a 3.5 year grace period). The loan was insured by Sinosure. The Government of Gabon also issued a sovereign guarantee for 25% of the face value of the loan on July 14, 2011. This project involved the construction of the Moanda Metallurgical Complex (CCM) near the town of Moanda within Haut-Ogooué Province in south-east Gabon.   The complex consists of two plants: a silico-manganese plant with a production capacity of 65,000 tons (which has been operational since August 2014) and a metal manganese plant with a production capacity of 20,000 tons (which has been operational since January 2015).  Construction began in April 2009, and the President of the Republic of Gabon Ali Bongo Ondimba inaugurated the CCM on June 12, 2015.  This $400 million project was initiated as part of a partnership between Eramet and Gabon’s state-owned mining company Société Equatoriale des Mines (SEM).   ICBC agreed to provide 70% of the financing ($109.9 million) while BNP Paribas agreed to provide the remaining 30% ($47.1 million). BNP Paribas, as the implementing agency, would act as mandated lead arranger, facility agent and security agent.","1. The French project title is Complexe Métallurgique de Moanda. 2. This loan is not included in the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020. 3. AidData has coded this transaction as a collateralized loan because BNP Paribas was selected as the security agent (i.e. collateral agent) for the loan.
