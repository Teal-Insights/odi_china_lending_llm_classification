China Eximbank suspends debt service payments under preferential buyer’s credit for Velana International Airport Upgrade and Expansion Upgrade and Expansion Project between January and June 2021 (Linked to Project ID#38083)

# Description
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting that took place on April 15, 2020 and on November 13, 2020, the Chinese Government agreed to work with other G20 members to implement the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI).  As part of DSSI, China Eximbank and the Government of the Maldives signed a debt suspension agreement during calendar year 2021. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2021 under a $373.8 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the Velana International Airport Upgrade and Expansion Upgrade and Expansion Project (captured via Project ID#38083). The total estimated suspension amount is $3,403,170.   At the time that the parties signed the debt suspension agreement, they both acknowledged that the total suspension amount would ultimately be determined at the end of the suspension period (since loan disbursements could be made during the suspension period and the lender agreed to suspend the payment of interest accrued on any disbursements during the suspension period). The lender and borrower agreed that the suspension of debt service would be undertaken on a net present value (NPV)-neutral basis. Therefore, the borrower agreed to pay interest accrued on the amount outstanding under the total suspension amount (‘Suspension Interest’) by paying the Suspension Interest on the amount outstanding under each loan agreement’s suspension amount at the same rate of interest set forth in the original loan agreement.
