30201,HEALTH,Chinese Government provides RMB 70 million grant for Sino-Congolese Friendship Hospital Construction Project in M’Filou,"In 2009, the Chinese Government and the Republic of Congo signed a grant agreement for the Sino-Congolese Friendship Hospital Construction Project. China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) was the source of grant funding and it reportedly committed RMB 70 million (approximately 5.6 billion CFA francs or $10 million) in total.   This project involved the construction of a 100-bed hospital in M’Filou (Mfilou), which is the 7th arrondissement of the capital city of Brazzaville. The hospital occupies an area of more than 6,300 m2 and it consists of an outpatient building, emergency building, medical technology building, ward building, and dormitory building. It is equipped with a laboratory, an operating theater, a mortuary, and modern medical technology.   China State Construction Engineering Corporation Ltd. (CSCEC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. They signed a construction contract on September 23, 2009. The project commenced on August 9, 2011 and it was completed on March 30, 2013. The hospital was officially inaugurated on March 30, 2013 by Chinese President Xi Jinping. It reportedly employs 260 doctors and nurses.","This project is also known as Comprehensive General Hospital Project in Mfilou District (in Brazzaville). The Chinese project title is 援刚姆非鲁医院 or 中刚友好医院 or 援刚医院项目 or 援刚果（布）综合医院和医疗队宿舍项目 or 中刚友好医院. The French project title is l'Hôpital d'amitié sino-congolaise de M’Filou or l'Hôpital de base de M’Filou. There are some indications that this project may have been partially financed with the proceeds from an interest-free loan that was signed on March 23, 2008 (see Project ID#30494). However, AidData has not yet independently confirmed that the Congolese authorities drew down on the March 23, 2008 loan to support this project, so it is coded as grant-financed for the time being. Also, some sources refer to the Sino-Congolese Friendship Hospital as having 120 beds, while others refer to it as having 95 or 100 beds.","# Sector
