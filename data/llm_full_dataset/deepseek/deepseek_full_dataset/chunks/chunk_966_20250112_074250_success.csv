53093,COMMUNICATIONS,China Eximbank provides $65.4 million loan for Phase I of Smart Zambia National ICT Development Project (Linked to Project ID#92219),"In March 2015, the Government of Zambia and China Eximbank signed a concessional loan agreement worth $65,468,016.48 for Phase 1 of the Smart Zambia National ICT Development Project. The proceeds of the loan were used to be used by the borrower to finance 100% of the cost of a $65,468,016.48 commercial contract between the Government of Zambia and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (Contract #00Y8941213000A), which was signed in January 2015. The contract was to be paid in three installments: one advance payment of 30% of the contract value, one payment worth 50% of the contract value at delivery, and a final payment equivalent to 20% of the contract value as an acceptance payment upon completion.   Phase 1 of Smart Zambia National ICT Development Project supported the creation of three data centers and an information and communications technology (ICT) talent training center (Chinese project name: 信息和通信技术人才培训中心). Zambia’s main national data center, managed by the Zambia Information and Communication Technology Authority (ZICTA), is located in Lusaka (exact locational coordinates: -15.423211184181552, 28.311501916335335). The ZICTA center covers an area about 450 square meters, with an equipment room containing 72 server cabinets, a power room, monitoring room, and two outdoor diesel-engine generators supported by underground fuel tanks. The ZICTA cloud platform was designed to provide processing, networking, and storage facilities for government and public institutions, and commercial enterprise services. The second data center is a a 400-square-meter backup facility located at the Roma switch office of Zamtel, the Zambian national telecommunications operator. The third data center is another 600-square meter backup facility situated at the Zamtel Kitwe switch office. All of the three centers are fully equipped with servers, power, monitoring, and communications equipment rooms.   Project implementation commenced in January 2016. A The ICT talent training center began operations in July 2016. The project was officially completed and handed over the authorities on February 28, 2017. The ZICTA National Data Center was put into operation in February 2019. This project has become the source of local and international controversy. In 2015, Zambia’s Anti-Corruption Commission reportedly investigated the circumstance surrounding the issuance of a no-bid contract to Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. Then, in August 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported that ‘in the country’s new $75 million data center, Huawei employees work with the Cybercrime Crack Squad, sitting in cubicles where they monitor and intercept digital communications from a broad spectrum that includes criminal suspects, as well as opposition groups, activists and journalists.’ It also reported that “on the second floor of Zicta’s gray-colored facility, behind biometric scanners, Huawei employees are embedded within Zambia’s new data center, which houses the Cybercrime Crack Squad, Zambian security officials said. Established in February [2019], around half of the 40-strong staff at the data center are Huawei employees, two Zambian officials there said. In April [2019], President Lungu’s office ordered a crackdown on news sites that had published a string of damaging stories.   Zambia was for decades seen as one of Africa’s most stable and permissive democracies, but in recent years it has moved to muzzle opposition media, shuttering some of the country’s top newspapers and television channels and pushing antigovernment voices onto Facebook sites and WhatsApp forums. Mr. Lungu’s press secretary, Amos Chanda, called the head of the cyber squad, Mofya Chisala, and a senior chief Huawei technician for help, Zambian intelligence officers said. Mr. Chanda said he had “no recollection of the events or meetings” with the cyber squad or Huawei officials. Mr. Chisala didn’t respond to requests for comment. Huawei technicians helped intercept the communications of opposition bloggers running a news site named Koswe, or “The Rat,” which had repeatedly criticized Mr. Lungu, the two Zambian officials in the Cybercrime Crack Squad said.

This supplier's credit loan carried a 7% interest rate. The maturity was from the date when the loan agreement came into effect (September 17, 2015) until the date when funds became available to ZESCO Limited from a financial institution. ZESCO obtained financing from ICBC on January 26, 2017 (project #57560). Principal and interest was repaid immediately after ZESCO and ICBC signed the loan agreement. Therefore, the Sinohydro supplier's credit loan maturity was approximately 16 months or 1.33 years. This loan was fully drawn down and then fully repaid on August 11, 2017.  The Musonda Falls Hydroelectric Power Plant is located in Musonda Falls within Mwense District and Luapula Province. It is a source of power supply to seven districts in the province—namely, Chiengi, Kawambwa, Mwense, Chipili, Chembe, Nchelenge and Samfya. The purpose of this project was to upgrade the Musonda Falls Hydroelectric Power Plant from 5MW to 10MW. This increase in local power capacity also added to the national grid capacity, thereby supporting the fishing industry, farming activities and potential mining activities in nearby communities.  In 2015, Sinohydro won the 18-month contract for project implementation. Sinohydro provided another bridging loan in 2016 (see project #66848) for the same project.
