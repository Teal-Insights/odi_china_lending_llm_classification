53577,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,Chinese Government provides RMB 500 million grant for 9th Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge Construction Project,"On May 11, 2017, China’s Ambassador to Bangladesh, Ma Mingqiang, and Mr. Kazi Shofiqul Azam, Secretary of Economic Relations Division (ERD) within the Ministry of Finance of Bangladesh signed an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA). Through this agreement, the Chinese Government committed RMB 500 million of grant funding for the construction of the 9th Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge Construction Project.   The purpose of the project is to construct a 8th Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge (also called Bekutia Bridge or বেকুটিয়া সেতু) — over Kocha (Kacha) river — about 5 kilometers east of the city of Pirojpur. The track length of the bridge is 2.96 kilometers, including one newly built 1.493 kilometers extra-large bridge. The total length of the main bridge section closed this time is 998 meters and with a width of 13.4 meters.   China Communications Highway Planning and Design Institute is the contractor responsible for project design. China Railway 17 Bureau Group Co Ltd is the contractor responsible for project implementation.  China Railway Major Bridge Reconnaissance & Design Institute Co Ltd is the contractor responsible for project management and supervision. In October 2015, China’s Ministry of Commerce (the funder of the project) commissioned the China Communications Highway Planning and Design Institute to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the construction of the 9th bridge. Then, on June 30, 2018, project implementation commenced. Construction of the main structure of the bridge was completed on December 28, 2021.   The project as a whole is expected to reach completion in June 2022. Upon completion, the project will connect the Khulna and Barishal divisions of Bangladesh by land transportation. The project is also expected to contribute to the economic and cultural exchange of both divisions and effectively improve the local road network structure there. The bridge will also promote better development of various industries such as agriculture, industry, aquatic fishery and tourism in southern Bangladesh, according to the Chinese embassy in Bangladesh. As of July 2022, the Boga bridge does not exist. Instead, there is a Boga Ferry port.","1. The Chinese project title is 建孟加拉国中孟友谊八桥项目.2. Some sources suggest that the face value of the grant that supported this project was worth RMB 528 million rather than RMB 500 million. This issue warrants further investigation. 3. It was initially proposed that the project support the 400-meter long Boga Bridge over River Lohalia on Lebukhali-Bhauphal-Dasmina-Golachipa-Amragachia road in Patuakhali district. This project would have helped connect Patuakhali Sadar, Dumki upazila with Bhauphal, Dashmina, and Golachipa upazila as well as the sea beach and Sonarchar sanctuary of Barguna district alongside the Kuakata sea beach and the 3rd Payra seaport. However, a new project site for the 8th Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge -- over Kocha river — was selected during the project design phase.","# Sector

53584,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",China Eximbank provides $467.8 million preferential buyer's credit for Installation of Single Point Mooring (SPM) with Double Pipe Line Project (Linked to Project ID#38349),"On October 29, 2017, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the Installation of Single Point Mooring (SPM) with the Double Pipe Line Project. Under the terms of this framework agreement, China Eximbank pledged to provide a preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) worth $467,840,000 and a government concessional loan (GCL) worth RMB 569,664,000 for the project. China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh finalized the PBC and GCL agreements on November 3, 2017; however, the loans did not become ‘effective’ until April 2018.   The GCL (captured via Project ID#38349) carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and a 0.2% commitment fee. The PBC (captured via Project ID#53661) carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and a 0.25% commitment fee. The first repayment date for the GCL and the PBC was scheduled for April 2023. The GCL and PBC proceeds were to be used by the borrower to finance a $550.4 million commercial (EPC) contract between Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) and China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau (CPPB), which was signed on December 7, 2016. According to the Government of Bangladesh’s Economic Relations Division (ERD), the GCL had achieved a disbursement rate of 100% (RMB 569,664,000 out of RMB 569,664,000) as of June 30, 2020, while the PBC had achieved a 0% disbursement rate ($0 out of $467,840,000) as of June 30, 2020 and a 46.7% disbursement rate ($218,773,000 out of $467,840,000) as of June 30, 2021. According to the Government of Bangladesh’s ERD, the borrower had not made any repayments under the GCL or the PBC as of June 30, 2021.   The purpose of the project is to construct an oil tanker mooring platform and a 200 km underwater and onshore pipeline in Chittagong, Bangladesh. The project was launched because Bangladesh is not capable of handling large vessels carrying imported crude and finished oil, due to the low navigability of a key river channel and constrained facilities at the main seaport in Chittagong. The single-point mooring system, once constructed, is expected help to offload 1.2 lakh tons of crude oil within only 48 hours and 70,000 tons of diesel in 28 hours. Its annual capacity to offload oil will be nine million tons, and it will be able to save Tk800 crore per year. Upon project completion, liquid fuel oil is expected to be carried to Moheshkhali Island, on the Bay of Bengal in Bangladeshi Cox's Bazar district, through the pipeline from large tankers anchored in the deep sea. Later, the 110-km pipelines installed under the Bay of Bengal and in coastal areas is expected to directly carry the oil to the Eastern Refinery in Chattogram from Moheshkhali. The project also involves the construction of a 146-km offshore pipeline and 74-km onshore pipeline to carry imported oil from the sea to a refinery in Chittagong district, some 242 km southeast of Dhaka, for processing.  CPPB, which is a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), is the contractor responsible for constructing the oil tanker mooring platform as well as establishing the 146 km of the pipeline under the Bay of Bengal to the coast.    In January 2015, CPPB and the Energy Division under the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources of Bangladesh signed an agreement to build a single point mooring system (SPM) in the Bay of Bengal to carry petroleum from vessels at the outer anchorage to depots onshore.    Then, in March 2015, the state-run Eastern Refinery Ltd (ERL) received a technical offer from the CPPB to build the SPM. Before submitting the technical offer, a team from the CPPB visited the project location near Moheshkhali Island in the Bay of Bengal and found the site suitable. The ERL, along with an international consultant, was expected to review the 'lone' technical offer before submitting its evaluation report to the Energy and Mineral Resources Division (EMRD) under Bangladesh’s Ministry of Power, Energy, and Mineral Resources (MPEMR). CPPB was then expected to submit a financial offer on completion of the review.   The project was originally expected to take 36 months to complete, but as of October 2018, CPPB had only completed initial surveying and some design work. Construction began on or around February 20, 2019. Drilling then began on March 15, 2019. The project has also completed channel deep post-trenching of the first offshore pipeline despite great technical difficulties. The maximum trenching depth is 11.9 meters, setting a world record for the deepest offshore pipeline post-trenching in the industry and laying a solid foundation for the overall construction of the project.   Work continued during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021. Strict quality control and safety risk control were reportedly put in place. The project had achieved a 63.5% completion rate as of September 2021 and an 83% completion rate as of June 2022. Its originally scheduled completion date was December 2018. However, it has run behind schedule and is over budget. The project completion deadline was first extended to December 2019. Then, it was extended to June 2022. Then, it was extended again — to June 2023. As of 2022, land owners whose plots of land were acquired for the project claimed not yet been compensated despite multiple cost overruns. The total cost of the project reportedly escalated by 44% and some media sources indicate that China Eximbank agreed to upsize its lending commitments for the project by 20.1% (from Tk 3,903.22 crore to Tk 4,688.26 crore).","1. The Government of Bangladesh loan identification number for the China Eximbank GCL is L1120171103B.
