CETIC is a subsidiary of State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC).  Under these two agreements, CETIC International Hy­dro­power Development Co. Ltd. was granted a 30-year build-operate-transfer (BOT) concession and the Government of Cambodia provided a guarantee to CETIC International Hy­dro­power Development Co. Ltd. that it would purchase any power produced by the Kirirom III plant in the event of non-payment by EDC.  In order to facilitate the implementation of the $66.53 million project, China Eximbank reportedly issued a loan worth $47.1 million to CETIC International Hy­dro­power Development Co. Ltd. in 2008. The purpose of the project was to install two additional 9MW power generation units at the existing Kirirom Hydroelectric Power Plant (‘Kirirom I’) in Koh Kong Province. CETIC constructed Kirirom I with an earlier loan from China Eximbank (captured in linked ProjectID#32080).  A feasibility study for the 18MW Kirirom III Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project was completed in 2004. Construction started on March 5, 2009, and the expanded power plant was put into operation on April 24, 2012. The plant was officially inaugurated on February 23, 2013. Upon completion, the power plant was capable of generating 78 million kilowatt-hours each year.   However, this project was plagued by scandal after its completion.

Mr. Chen Chun Lin was ordered to repay the $1.93 million he stole from the CETIC International Hy­dro­power Development Co. Ltd., and pay approximately $50,000 in damages. During his trial, Chen Chun Lin confessed to secretly writing 52 checks over the course of 2015 and then proceeding to withdraw money from a company bank account once the checks were cleared. When the judge asked him how he used the money, he replied: “I used it for gambling. I subsequently spent it all in gambling since early 2015”. Chen Chun Lin was imprisoned on December 26, 2015.
