69189,COMMUNICATIONS,Chinese Government provides $1.5 million grant for Satellite TV Project for 300 Villages (Linked to Project ID#57618),"On July 28, 2017, the Chinese Embassy in Ghana issued a letter to Ghana’s Minister of Finance, seeking confirmation that his government wished to proceed with the Satellite TV Project for 300 Villages Project, requesting a project coordinator, and asking for a list of the 300 villages where the satellite TV equipment should be installed. On August 1, 2017, Ghana’s Minister of Finance responded to the letter from the Chinese Embassy. The Minister confirmed his government’s acceptance of the project, identified Ghana’s Ministry of Communications as the project coordinator, and provided a list of 300 beneficiary villages. Then, on November 29, 2017, the Chinese Government and the Government of Ghana signed an exchange of letters, which codified a $1,531,721.98 grant commitment for the Satellite TV Project for 300 Villages. The proceeds of the grant were to be used to finance a contract [ID#WCT03-Ghana-G01] between the Government of Ghana and Startimes Software Technology Co. Ltd., which was signed on May 7, 2018.   The project involved the provision of two sets of solar project TV systems, one digital TV integrated with a decoder, and digital decoder systems to 300 communities (villages): 57 communities from the Ashanti Region, 43 communities from the Eastern Region, 37 communities from the Greater Accra Region and 35 communities from the Central Region, 31 communities from Brong Ahafo Region, 30 villages from the Northern Region, 24 communities from the Western Region, 18 communities from the Volta Region, 17 villages from the Upper East Region, 8 villages from the Upper West Region. Beneficiary villages were to be jointly selected by Ghana’s Ministry of Communications and StarTimes based on the following criteria: (1) villages with a certain scale (e.g. about 100 households) and more TV sets; (2) villages with convenient transportation and close to the city; (3) villages with public areas (e.g. public toilets, schools, hospitals, etc.); (4) villages with a certain amount of power infrastructure or daily power generation equipment; and (5) villages that support projects and are willing to provide the ‘appropriate implementation guarantee’. In each village/community that participated in the project, 20 households were selected on the basis of need and provided with 20 sets of satellite TV set-top boxes (STBs). A public area in each village was also equipped with two sets of solar-powered projection TV systems and one set of solar 32-inch digital TV integrated together. The public areas were able to access two channels of StarTimes entertainment free of charge. The beneficiary households that were selected on the basis of need were able to access 30 channels free of charge (including CGTN and CNC World) for 6 months after installation of the STBs. At the end of the 6-month period, free access to the 30 channel “bouquet” came to an end except for 2 free-to-air (FTA) channels — specifically, GTV and GTV Sports Plus.  After the six-month free access period came to an end, the beneficiary households automatically became subscribers and could access the 30 channels, only upon payment of a monthly subscription of 15 Ghana cedis. Beneficiary households that failed to subscribe after free access came to an end and those who subscribed but later failed to renew their subscriptions were only granted access to 2 free-to-air (FTA) channels — specifically, GTV and GTV Sports Plus.    StarTimes Software Technology Co., Ltd. was the contractor responsible for project implementation. It was also responsible for the maintenance and repairs of the devices once they were installed at no cost to the beneficiary communities for a five-year period. StarTimes was also expected to train 600 ‘ambassadors’ — two people selected from each of the 300 villages/communities — on the installation and maintenance of these devices. Project implementation was originally expected to take place between April 2018 and September 2018. However, it ultimately commenced on September 26, 2018 and ended on May 10, 2019. This project is part of the larger regional commitment to establish satellite TV to 10,000 villages from China to a number of African nations (captured via Project ID#57618).","1.

Then, on September 3, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Ghana signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 2.1 billion ($330 million). The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 17.2 year-maturity (final maturity date: November 21, 2025), a 5-year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2013), an interest rate of CIRR plus a margin of 0.75% (6.13%), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity (final maturity date: September 3, 2028), a 7 year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2015), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL is captured via Project ID#30801 and the BCL is captured via Project ID#183. The BCL was collateralized with (a) net revenue from a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between Bui Power Authority — an organization with a mandate to plan, execute and manage the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant Project — and the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) for the purchase of the energy to be generated from the Bui hydroelectric power plant, and (b) receivables from Ghana Cocoa Board’s sale of up to 30,000 tons of main crop cocoa and 10,000 tons of light crop cocoa per annum to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing under a 20-year, Cocoa Sales Agreement (CSA); and (c) and a mortgage of the land and building and equipment and machinery of the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant. The cocoa beans were sold at the prevailing market price rather than a fixed price, and the proceeds were to be placed in a Government of Ghana bank account to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). Then, once the dam was operational (and the cocoa agreement came to an end), 85% of the proceeds from sales of energy generated by the Bui hydroelectric power plant were to be placed in an escrow account held by China Eximbank to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). The borrower was expected to maintain a minimum cash balance in the escrow account. The escrow account balance was $27,275,000 in 2018 and $25,582,000 in 2019. The Government of Ghana bank account (for the cash proceeds from COCOBOD’s sale of cocoa to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing) had a balance of $167,816,000 in 2018 and $209,783,000 in 2019. The GCL, by contrast, was not collateralized; it was backed by the full faith and credit of the Government of Ghana. The borrower also purchased a buyer’s credit insurance policy from Sinosure at a cost of $25 million for the BCL (i.e. 8.5% of the face value of the BCL).

China Eximbank reschedules preferential buyer’s credit for Bui Dam Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#30801, #183, #30086, #30709, #95483)

# Description
On September 25, 2007, China Eximbank and the Government of Ghana signed a buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement worth $293,506,062 for the Bui Dam Construction Project. Then, on September 3, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Ghana signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 2.1 billion ($330 million). The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 17.2 year-maturity (final maturity date: November 21, 2025), a 5-year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2013), an interest rate of CIRR plus a margin of 0.75% (6.13%), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity (final maturity date: September 3, 2028), a 7 year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2015), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL is captured via Project ID#30801 and the BCL is captured via Project ID#183. The BCL was collateralized with (a) net revenue from a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between Bui Power Authority — an organization with a mandate to plan, execute and manage the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant Project — and the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) for the purchase of the energy to be generated from the Bui hydroelectric power plant, and (b) receivables from Ghana Cocoa Board’s sale of up to 30,000 tons of main crop cocoa and 10,000 tons of light crop cocoa per annum to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing under a 20-year, Cocoa Sales Agreement (CSA); and (c) and a mortgage of the land and building and equipment and machinery of the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant. The cocoa beans were sold at the prevailing market price rather than a fixed price, and the proceeds were to be placed in a Government of Ghana bank account to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). Then, once the dam was operational (and the cocoa agreement came to an end), 85% of the proceeds from sales of energy generated by the Bui hydroelectric power plant were to be placed in an escrow account held by China Eximbank to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). The borrower was expected to maintain a minimum cash balance in the escrow account. The escrow account balance was $27,275,000 in 2018 and $25,582,000 in 2019. The Government of Ghana bank account (for the cash proceeds from COCOBOD’s sale of cocoa to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing) had a balance of $167,816,000 in 2018 and $209,783,000 in 2019. The GCL, by contrast, was not collateralized; it was backed by the full faith and credit of the Government of Ghana. The borrower also purchased a buyer’s credit insurance policy from Sinosure at a cost of $25 million for the BCL (i.e. 8.5% of the face value of the BCL).  According to the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $293,506,062 loan (BCL) and the $330,000,000 loan (GCL) jointly achieved a 81.2% average disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 30 loan disbursements (worth $505,088,349.00) between 2009 and 2012: a $57,786,692.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #1) on May 15, 2009, a $35,217,544.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #2) on February 27, 2009, a $10,896,807.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #3) on October 26, 2009, a $27,469,679.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #4) on December 15, 2009, a $6,865,488.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #5) on January 18, 2010, a $9,390,036.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #6) on February 25, 2010, a $13,754,282.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #7) on May 9, 2010, a $18,208,899.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #8) on July 23, 2010, a $6,755,424.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #9) on July 23, 2010, a $8,919,668.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #10) on August 18, 2010, a $7,321,959.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #11) on September 20, 2010, a $6,563,979.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #12) on December 10, 2010, a $5,515,930.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #13) on December 6, 2010, a $107,904,311.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #14) on December 30, 2010, a $12,367,797.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #15) on February 28, 2011, a $8,689,838.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #16) on March 18, 2011, a $7,321,338.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #17) on April 28, 2011, a $6,870,418.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #18) on June 7, 2011, a $6,957,804.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #19) on July 22, 2011, a $16,330,457.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #20) on September 13, 2011, a $4,248,349.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #21) on October 31, 2011, a $4,071,390.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #22) on November 30, 2011, a $19,056,526.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #23) on December 28, 2011, a $5,071,871.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #24) on April 12, 2012, a $6,955,729.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #25) on April 12, 2012, a $14,889,380.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #26) on May 18, 2012, a $4,807,999.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #27) on June 22, 2012, a $48,355,586.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #28) on July 31, 2012, a $13,242,808.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #29) on October 12, 2012, and a $3,280,361.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #30) on November 30, 2012.
