The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, an 18-month grace period, and an unknown interest rate. It is backed by a Sinosure credit insurance policy. The borrower is expected to use the loan proceeds to finance 85% of the cost of a USD 1.51 billion commercial contract between Angola’s Ministry of Transportation (MINTRANS) and China National Aero-Technology International Engineering Corporation (AVIC-ENG).   The purpose of the project is to construct and equip the New Angola International Airport (NAIA), which is located approximately 40 km to the southeast of the centre of Luanda, in the Bom Jesus commune, Icole e Bengo municipality in Luanda Province. The airport is designed to be an alternative to the existing Quatro de Fevereiro Airport, another international airport that serves Luanda. The new airport is being designed to have an annual capacity of 15 million passengers and 600,000 tons of cargo, with a 4,200 meter runway and 3,800 meter runway, and a 160,000 square meter terminal. The airport will also have 12 aircraft docks, a VIP passenger terminal, and an air traffic control tower.

Construction on this project began in 2007 under the management of the China International Fund (CIF); however, in February 2019, the Angolan Government announced that it had cancelled the contract with CIF. CIF was replaced by AVIC-Eng. Other contractors and suppliers involved in the project are Metallurgical Corporation of China (CTMCC), Dalian Zongyi Science & Technology Development, Fangda New Materials (Jiangxi), and Beijing Urban Construction Exploration & Surveying Design Research Institute. Angola's Ministry of Transportation (MoT) also appointed Mace Engineering Group as project manager and site supervisor for the project on March 27, 2015.
