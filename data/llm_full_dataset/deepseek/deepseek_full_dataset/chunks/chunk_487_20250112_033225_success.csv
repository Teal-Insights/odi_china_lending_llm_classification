The project has also reportedly resulted in comprehensive, video protection for the physical environment of school campuses, and a unified communications system that has made cross-school interaction and remote collaboration more efficient. Other achievements include: a modular data center that has significantly shortened project deployment time, a unified intelligent management system that has slashed network fault location times from hours to minutes; and an intelligent optimization system that has improved overall network performance by 50%; the establishment of a remote training system, remote interactive classroom capabilities, and an online learning system (so that teachers in remote regions can receive the training they need); the installation of video conference and online video capabilities (so that teachers from all areas of the country can benefit from the experiences and skills of the best teachers in the country); the establishment of multiple training centers to help improve the ICT skills of teachers; the establishment of a remote online learning platform and remote interactive classroom capabilities (to given students access to learning resources anytime and anywhere).","1.
