This framework agreement (captured in Project ID#60219) was ratified on October 26, 2006.   Two of the subsidiary loans that were approved through the framework agreement included a $70 million loan in 2008 (captured in Project ID#57477) and a $10 million loan in 2012 (captured in Project ID#30497) for Phase 1 of the National Telecommunication Coverage Project. The $10 million loan agreement was signed on September 9, 2012 and it went into force on December 10, 2012. The estimated borrowing terms for these two loans are as follows: a 0.25% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, and a 5-year grace period. The proceeds from these two loans were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $100 million commercial contract for Phase 1.

The proceeds from this loan was to be used for the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $73 million commercial contract for Phase 2.

Alcatel-Lucent Shanghai Bell Co., Ltd., Huawei, and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) were the contractors responsible for the implementation of Phases 1 and 2. The project officially commenced in August 2010.
