The Government of Zambia agreed to directly finance the remaining 15% ($22.5 million) of the commercial contract cost.   The project involved the construction of a new raw water abstraction station on the Kafue River, a water treatment plant, a 66 km treated water pipeline from Kafue to Lusaka, and a booster station in Chilanga and transmission lines to deliver a total of 50,000m3/day of water into the existing Stuart Park storage facilities in Lusaka. The ultimate objective of the project was to improve water supply to Lusaka and surrounding areas. Upon completion, the project was expected to benefit 480,000 people in Lusaka and surrounding areas.   China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) Zambia Limited was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company (LWSC). A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 20, 2016. However, construction did not begin until September 5, 2016.

As of December 2020, the project had achieved a 96% completion rate. On July 29, 2022, a project completion ceremony took place. At the ceremony, Zambian president Hakainde Hichilema said that the completion of the project would ensure that about 500,000 people in the Zambian capital have access to clean and safe water as well as proper sanitation.
