56541,ENERGY,China Eximbank contributes to syndicated buyer's credit loan for Unit 2 of 220 MW Sirajganj Combined Cycle Power Plant Project (Linked to Project ID#69033),"In August 2015, North-West Power Generation Company Limited (NWPGCL) — a state-owned power company in Bangladesh — signed a $200.03 million syndicated buyer's credit loan agreement with a group of Chinese and non-Chinese lenders (including Standard Chartered Bank, the Export-Import Bank of China, and Siemens Bank) for Unit 2 of the 220MW Sirajganj Combined Cycle Power Plant Project. The transaction was structured as a long-term loan with a maturity of 15 years and a grace period of 3 years. The loan was scheduled for repayment (beginning in August 2018) in 24 semi-annual installments. The loan was backed by a sovereign repayment guarantee and split into 3 tranches: a Sinosure-insured loan tranche, a Euler Hermes-insured tranche, and a MIGA-insured tranche.    The Euler Hermes-insured tranche carried an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 1.95% margin, while the Sinosure-insured tranche carried an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3.26% margin and the MIGA-insured carried an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 1.9% margin. The Sinosure-insured loan tranche disbursed $119,424,457 as of June 30, 2021. The Euler Hermes-insured loan tranche disbursed $32,288,027 as of June 30, 2021.

On December 18, 2015, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) signed two loan contracts with the Government of Barbados for the Strengthening Strengthening Human and Social Development in Barbados Project: a $5 million loan that IDB issued from its ordinary capital (Loan 3542/OC-BA), and a $5 million loan from the People's Bank of China (Loan 3542/CH-BA) via the China Co-Financing Fund for Latin America and the Caribbean (CHC). The $10 million of loan financing authorized by IDB was designed cover the total project cost. The IDB approval date for this loan financing was September 21, 2015, and it refers to this project as ‘BA-L1032 : Strengthening Human and Social Development in Barbados’. The CHC loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 25-year maturity, a 5.5-year (66-month) grace period, a 0.75% commitment (credit) fee, no management fee, and an annual interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 0.5% funding margin (also known as the ‘Bank’s Cost of Funding’) and a 1.15% IDB lending spread.
