53832,OTHER SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES,ICBC provides $368.9 million buyer's credit for Phase 2 of 7000 Housing Units Project (Linked to Project ID#54282 and #54276),"On April 24, 2017, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) provided a $368.9 million buyer’s credit (loan) facility agreement with the Housing Development Corporation (HDC) — a state-owned enterprise in the Maldives — for Phase 2 of the 7000 Housing Units Project. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a maturity of 15 years, a grace period of 2 years, and an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3.3% margin. The loan is backed by a sovereign guarantee from the Ministry of Finance and Treasury of the Government of Maldives. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a $434 million commercial contract with China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC). HDC contracted a $65.1 million loan from the Singapore Branch of Credit Suisse AG on December 13, 2017 to finance the other 15% of the commercial contract cost.   The first ICBC loan disbursement took place on April 20, 2018. Total loan disbursements amounted to $209,076,876.84 by September 2018 and $221,098,337 by December 31, 2018. ICBC made additional loan disbursements to HDC worth $87,286,256 during calendar year 2020. The borrower made loan repayments to ICBC worth $14,188,462 during calendar year 2020 and $14,820,153 during calendar year 2021.

The purpose of the project was to construct 7,000 apartments in Hulhumalé. The project involved the construction of 16 high-rise (25 story) buildings and 451,900 square meters of floor space. Each housing unit was to measure 550 square feet, featuring two bedrooms and two bathrooms. Upon completion, the ‘social housing’ project was expected to provide public housing for nearly 30,000 people and created approximately 1,600 jobs for local communities.  All construction materials such as steel and cement were to be transported from China.   China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. As of October 2017, it was expected that the 7,000 housing units would be complete by the end of 2018.  CSCEC began work on the project on November 18, 2017, after a groundbreaking ceremony attended by Maldives President Abdulla Yameen. The project was officially completed on April 7, 2020,  despite complications resulting form the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there were still construction activities underway in May 2020, with CSEC and HDC constructing labor quarters in Hulhumalé Phase II.   There are some indications that the ICBC loan has underperformed financially and that the borrower (HDC) has had difficulty meeting its repayment obligations to the lender.  On October 18, 2018 HDC entered into a short-term loan agreement with the Maldives Ministry of Finance and Treasury amounting to MVR 94 million for the purpose of refinancing the interest payment obligation falling due in the month of April 2019 under the ICBC loan agreement for Phase 2 of the 7000 Housing Units Project. The disbursement of the loan was made on October 18, 2018. The loan was obtained for a duration of 6 months, and it was repayable over two equal installments with first repayment starting after a grace period of two months from the date of disbursement; interest was charged and payable on a monthly basis at a rate of 9% per annum.

The loan was largest one ever taken by the Maldivian Government to fund a housing project. 4. Loan repayments were scheduled to commence 6 months after the end of the the grace period of 24 months and then be followed with semi-annual repayment installments as per the agreed repayment schedule. 5. This ICBC-financed project, in conjunction with a CDB-financed project (captured via Project ID#54282), sought to increase public housing by 8,500 units on Hulhumalé, the second largest island of the Maldives, and improve the crowded living conditions in the country.  The main difference between this project and the Bank of China-financed 1,700 (formerly 2,500) unit housing project in Hulhumalé Phase II (captured via Project ID#54276) is that the proposed buildings for the 1,700 housing unit project are all 15 or 16 stories high, while this 7,000 housing unit project includes buildings that are 25 stories high.6.

The purpose of the project was to design and construct the Irufen Island Resort (also known as Sun Siyam Iru Fen Maldives) on the Noonu Atoll, which covers an area of 54 hectares. The resort was originally planned to feature beach villas, showstopper suites, private pools, restaurants, bars, a world-class spa, wellness and sports facilities, a kids’ village. Its location is close to some of the best dive spots in the region. Upon completion, the resort was expected to become the largest in the Maldives with 509 rooms.

Ahmed Siyam Holdings Pvt Ltd failed to meet a $10 million loan repayment obligation that was due to China Eximbank on July 21, 2020. The next day, China Eximbank warned the Government of the Maldives that, as the ultimate guarantor of the private debt, it was responsible for the loan repayment obligations of Ahmed Siyam Holdings Pvt Ltd., and failing to meet these obligations would result in a sovereign default, thereby jeopardizing the country’s international credit ratings and its macroeconomic stability. This issue was ultimately resolved when the Maldivian government threatened to exercise its mortgage rights if Ahmed Siyam Holdings Pvt Ltd did not deposit the overdue payment in an escrow account within five business days. Then, in 2021, the borrower made no loan repayments to China Eximbank (despite the fact that the loan's grace period had expired).","1.

The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 14-year maturity, a 2-year grace period, and an annual interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3% margin. It is backed by a sovereign guarantee from the Ministry of Finance and Treasury of the Government of Maldives.   The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 84.8% of the cost of a $187.5 million commercial (EPC) contract between China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) and the Maldivian Ministry of Housing and Infrastructure, which was signed on November 9, 2015. HDC contracted a $14.25 million loan from Sri Lankan commercial bank Seylan Bank PLC to finance the other 15.2% of the commercial contract cost.   The first CDB loan disbursement took place on March 1, 2018, and the CDB loan had achieved a 26.4% disbursement rate ($42 million out of $159 million) as of December 31, 2018.

The purpose of Phase 3 (also known as the Vinares housing project) was to build somewhere between 1,344 and 1,530 housing units (apartments) across 10 towers in Hulhumalé. The Vinares apartments (‘flats’) were developed in four concepts; 172 marina view flats, 372 outer view flats, 352 inner view flats, and 448 standard view flats. The marina view apartments have a view of the yacht marina and cruise terminal, while inner view apartments have a view of the main roads. The outside view is of the city, and standard apartments are in the middle of the towers. Each tower consists of a parking space, security, CCTV, fire and safety, a garbage shoot, and four elevators. The ground and first floor of each tower are allocated for commercial uses. One convenience store, five meat/fish shops, one retail shop, on tailor shop, two pharmacies, and a clinic were to be opened in the towers.  The project, in conjunction with an ICBC-funded project (captured via Project ID#53832), sought to increase public housing by 8,500 units on Hulhumalé, the second largest island of the Maldives, and improve the crowded living conditions in the country.

HDC revealed that 1,413 applications were received for the sale of apartments by September 15, 2022. Eligible tenants will be selected by the Ministry of National Planning, Housing and Infrastructure. HDC noted the score list will be arranged after surveying the living conditions of the applicants. HDC will then conduct the unit selection on a list order basis before handing over the apartments to tenants who are financially eligible and those applicants who do not meet the requirements will be cancelled and opened for the waitlist.

HDC will then conduct the unit selection on a list order basis before handing over the apartments to tenants who are financially eligible and those applicants who do not meet the requirements will be cancelled and opened for the waitlist. As of September 2022, the project as a whole was expected to reach completion by the end of the first quarter of 2023 (at which point the apartments will be handed over to the eligible tenants).  There are some indications that the CDB loan for Phase 3 of the 1530 Housing Units Project has underperformed financially and that the borrower (HDC) had difficulty meeting its repayment obligations to the lender. On September 18, 2019, HDC entered into a short-term loan agreement with the Maldives Ministry of Finance and Treasury amounting to MVR 27,979,480 for the purpose of refinancing the interest payment obligation falling due in the month of September 2019 under the CDB loan agreement for Phase 3 of the 1530 Housing Units Project. The disbursement of the loan was made on September 18, 2019. The loan was obtained for a duration of 12 months, and it was repayable in monthly installments from the date of disbursement; interest was charged and payable on a monthly basis at a rate of 10% per annum. Additionally, borrower repayments to CDB declined from $18,600,000 during calendar year 2020 to $9,670,000 during calendar year 2021.",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,Social Development,The project focuses on housing development and social infrastructure without clear environmental or energy transition impacts,"Construction of 1,344-1,530 housing units with commercial spaces, aimed at improving living conditions and increasing public housing availability"
