In December 2007, China Eximbank and the Government of Namibia signed an RMB 1 billion concessional loan framework (recorded in the linked project #1314), which identified several projects that would be funded according to a consistent set of terms and conditions. One of these projects was the Electronics Document and Record Management Systems (EDRMS) Project. This agreement was signed by China’s Ambassador to Namibia Ren Xiaoping and Nambia’s Minister of Finance Saara Kuugongelwa-Amadhila.   Then, in 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Namibia signed an RMB 41 million loan agreement for the Electronics Document and Record Management Systems (EDRMS) Project. The GCL carries the following terms: 15 year maturity, 5 year grace period, and 2% interest rate. The final loan maturity date, according to ""Summary Report of the Auditor-General on the Account of the Government of Namibia for the Financial Year Ended 31 March 2014,"" is February 9, 2032.   This project involved the installation of an electronic government record system called Electronics Document and Record Management Systems (EDRMS). Beijing Guanqun Information Technology Co., Ltd. (CSSCA) (北京中软冠群软件技术有限公司) was the contractor responsible for implementation. It signed a commercial contract with the Government of Namibia on August 2007. This project was officially completed and handed over to the Namibian authorities on May 27, 2009. As of March 2018, the EDRMS had been fully implemented within the Namibia’s Mines and Energy, Namibia Correctional Services, and Namibia’s Ministry of Gender Equality and Child Welfare.
