In 2017, Bumi Resources restructured its debt, including loans from CIC and CDB; the loans were exchanged for equity and mandatory convertible bonds. It is unclear if the 2009 CIC loan was specifically included (suggesting debt distress or maturity extensions), or if this refers to another CIC loan. This issue merits further investigation.2. In July 2014, CIC agreed to prevent Bumi from entering bankruptcy by purchasing a 19% stake in Kaltim Prima Coal, Indonesia's largest coal mine, in exchange for the settling of $950 million of debt. By August 2014, Bumi agreed to give its 42% stake in its subsidiary Bumi Resources Minerals plus a stake in PT Bumi to CIC worth $150 million to reduce its debt to CIC. On August 12, 2014, PT Bumi defaulted on $375 million of convertible bonds, triggering default under $1 billion senior secured notes due in 2016 and 2017. However, these moves were seen as only providing short-term relief due to further material debt maturities scheduled for 2014 {{see ID#186049}}.3.
