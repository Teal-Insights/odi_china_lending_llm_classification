96454,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Industrial and Commercial Bank of China contributes $66 million to a $400 million syndicated loan for BTC Pipeline Refinancing Project (Linked to Project ID#65866, #65867, and #96452)","In 2003, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) issued a $125 million loan and a syndicate of commercial banks issued a $125 million loan to Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline Company (BTC) — a special purpose vehicle — for the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline Construction Project. BTC’s shareholders are BP (30,1%), SOCAR (25,00%), Unocal (8,90%), Statoil (8,71%), TPAO (6,53%), Eni (5,00%), Total (5,00%), Itochu (3,40%), INPEX (2,50%), ConocoPhillips (2,50%) and Amerada Hess (2,36%). This project involved the construction of a 1,768 km oil pipeline from the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli oil field in the Caspian Sea to the Ceylon Terminal located on the Turkish coast of the Mediterranean Sea. This pipeline passes through Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey. From the Ceyhan Terminal, the oil is distributed to international markets.  The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline Company was established in London on August 1, 2002. A ceremony launching construction of the pipeline was held on September 18, 2002. Construction began in April 2003 and was completed in 2005. The Azerbaijan section was constructed by Consolidated Contractors International of Greece, and Georgia's section was constructed by a joint venture of France's Spie Capag and UK Petrofac International. The Turkish section was constructed by BOTAŞ Petroleum Pipeline Corporation. Bechtel was the main contractor for engineering, procurement, and construction. On May 25, 2005, the pipeline was inaugurated at the Sangachal Terminal by President Ilham Aliyev of the Azerbaijan Republic, President Mikhail Saakashvili of Georgia, and President Ahmet Sezer of Turkey, joined by President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan and United States Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman. The inauguration of the Georgian section was hosted by President Mikheil Saakashvili at the pumping station near Gardabani on October 12, 2005. The inauguration ceremony at the Ceyhan terminal was held on July 13, 2006.  The pipeline was gradually filled with 10 million barrels of oil flowing from Baku and reaching Ceyhan on May 28, 2006. The first oil was loaded at the Ceyhan Marine Terminal (Haydar Aliyev Terminal) onto a tanker named British Hawthorn. The tanker sailed on June 4, 2006, with about 600,000 barrels (95,000 m3) of crude oil. As of June 30, 2014, 15.0 million tons of oil and condensate produced in Azerbaijan were transported through the BTC Pipeline, representing 69.8% of the total oil and condensate produced in Azerbaijan, and, as of December 2013, 29.8 million tons of oil and condensate produced in Azerbaijan, were transported through the BTC Pipeline, representing 68.5% of the total oil and condensate produced in Azerbaijan.  As of June 30, 2014, the BTC Pipeline had a throughput capacity of 1.2 mbd and 60 million tonnes per annum. Then, on November 17, 2015, a syndicated of banks — Including Bank of China (BoC) and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) — issued a $1.63 billion syndicated loan facility to the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) Pipeline Company (BTC) for ‘capital and business operations.’ BoC contributed $260.26 million (captured in Project ID#65866), while ICBC contributed $173.51 million (captured in Project ID#65867). Other members of the loan syndicate included MUFG, SMBC, HSBC, Société Générale, Citi and BNP Paribas Fortis. The five-year amortizing term loan is non-recourse to BTC’s shareholders and it was scheduled to mature in December 2020. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower for ‘capital and business operations.’ Then, on October 20, 2021, BTC signed a $400.17 million syndicated loan agreement with six Chinese and non-Chinese banks (including MUFG, Société Générale, Citibank, Credit Agricole Group, Bank of China and ICBC). This loan carries a 4-year maturity and an unknown interest rate. Bank of China and ICBC each contributed $66.67 million to the syndicate, captured in Project ID#96452 and #96454 respectively.

Then, on April 23, 2021, Dhaka Bypass Expressway Development Company Limited signed a $184.3 million (BDT 16.14 billion) syndicated overseas loan agreement with China Development Bank (CDB) and China CITIC Bank for the Joydevpur–Debogram–Bhulta–Madanpur Road Upgrading Project. On behalf of their respective loan syndicates, CDB and Bangladesh Infrastructure Finance Fund Limited signed a Common Terms Agreement. It is known that these loans carry 18-year maturities, but their interest rates and grace periods are unknown.   The Asian Development Bank (ADB) also issued a $100 million loan (ID#3958-BAN) on September 10, 2010 to Bangladesh Infrastructure Finance Fund Limited, which it appears to have on-lent to the Dhaka Bypass Expressway Development Company Limited (before the syndicated loans were issued).   The total cost of the Joydevpur–Debogram–Bhulta–Madanpur Road Upgrading Project is $412.2275 million (RMB 2.844 billion). It is being implemented on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30. Dhaka Bypass Expressway Development Company Limited signed a concession agreement with Bangladesh's Roads and Highways Department (RHD) on December 6, 2018. This agreement made Dhaka Bypass Expressway Development Company Limited responsible for designing, financing, constructing, operating, and maintaining the tolled expressway over a 25-year concession period, with tolls charged based on vehicle type. The Government of Bangladesh provided viability gap funding of BDT 3.1 billion and a minimum revenue guarantee to the concessionaire. The concession agreement also grants the Government of Bangladesh a share of the revenues generated by Dhaka Bypass Expressway Development Company Limited over a certain threshold.  The purpose of the project is to upgrade the 48 km Joydevpur–Debogram–Bhulta–Madanpur Road to a dual carriageway to improve connectivity between country's north and northwest with Chattogram Port. More specifically, the project will seek to add a four-lane tollway and a two-lane service to the Joydevpur–Debogram–Bhulta–Madanpur Road (National Highway N105). The project’s ultimate aim is to create a key connection between the industrial zone northeast of Dhaka and national highway N1 to Chattogram, as well as to the N2, N3, and N4 national highways. Due to heavy traffic concerns, it is hoped that this project will reduce journey times and address traffic issues. Upon completion, the Joydevpur–Debogram–Bhulta–Madanpur Road will become Bangladesh's first toll road. Construction was originally expected to commence in September 2019.  A foundation stone laying ceremony took place on December 26, 2019, and at that time, the project was expected to reach completion in 2022. However, the project hit several snags. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic led to major implementation delays. A 2017 land acquisition law also increased the amount of financial compensation needed to pay affected people considerably, which led to land acquisition delays. Construction ultimately began in October 2020. However, by June 2021, RHD had already requested an extension to the project completion deadline to June 2024.","1.

One source (“Administrative Sanction of the Government to Ms. Sandia Islam' ) suggests that ICBC may also be a lender to this project; however, that source refers only to negotiations, and as CDB had not committed a loan in July 2019, it was clearly a preliminary stage. 3. Dhaka Bypass Expressway Development Company is the project company responsible for implementation. Its ownership is as follows: Sichuan Road and Bridge (Group) Corporation Ltd (60 percent), Shamim Enterprise (Pvt) Ltd (30 percent), and UDC Corporation Ltd (10 percent) of Bangladesh. 4. Some sources claim that the consortium (and thus project company ownership) was entirely Chinese; however, '四川路桥投建孟加拉国首条全封闭高速公路', an official Chinese source, explicitly states that Shamim Enterprise Limited and UDC Construction Limited are of Bangladeshi origin. 5. Bangladesh Infrastructure Finance Fund Limited is a Bangladesh government owned non-bank financial institution with the purpose of encouraging investment in the infrastructure in Bangladesh. 6. Hogan Lovells served as legal counsel to the lenders. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) acted as financial advisor on the transaction to the Public–Private Partnership Authority (PPPA) of Bangladesh. The ADB has been working with the Government of Bangladesh for over 5 years to transform the country’s roads by making them a bankable asset class attractive to international investors, as has happened in other sectors such as the independent power producer sector. 7.

71614,ENERGY,Bank of China and China Eximbank provide syndicated loan for Barishal 350 MW (BEPCL) Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#96130),"In September 2021, China Eximbank and Bank of China signed a syndicated loan (facility) with Barisal Electric Power Company Limited (BEPCL) — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of Barisal Energy (DFC) Holding Limited (92% ownership stake), Sinohydro (Hong Kong) Holdings Limited (4% ownership stake) and ISO Tech Electrification Company Limited (4% ownership stake) — for the Barishal 350 MW (BEPCL) Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project. The loan carries a 15-year maturity. The other borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the Ministry of Finance of Bangladesh issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan on December 23, 2020 and a Sinosure credit insurance policy went into effect on October 27, 2021. It is also known that this $557.89 million independent power plant (IPP) project is being financed according to a 70:30 debt-to-equity ratio.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 350-megawatt (MW) coal-fired power station in the Nishanbaria village of Taltali upazila within Barguna district and Barisal division.   Shanghai Electric Power Construction Company Limited (SEPC) was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Satellite imagery demonstrates that preliminary construction activities began between January 2019 and November 2019. Construction of a 217-meter chimney started on December 16, 2020. Then, in February 2022, the lifting of the steel inner tube of the chimney was completed, marking the completion of the main chimney at the power plant. The power plant’s 400kV electricity transmission line was completed on May 19, 2022. The power plant was connected to the national grid on October 29, 2022. The power plant was originally scheduled to reach its commercial operation date (COD) on January 12, 2022. It passed its 168-hour reliability test and began commercial operations on December 31, 2022. Satellite imagery from December 2022 revealed a plume at the project site.   The project became a source of local controversy and public opposition. On August 2, 2018, villagers submitted a public petition to the Prime Minister urging the government to stop the project, alleging that BEPCL was purchasing lands with the help of illegal brokers with forged documents. In October 2018, the government said it would investigate the claims. In February 2019, Transparency International Bangladesh again called on the government to halt the plant's construction, claiming that the project had no approval from Bangladesh's Department of Environment — as well as claiming that local residents who have filed claims for compensation over land acquisition have been threatened and even assaulted. A study conducted by civil society organization the Bangladesh Working Group on External Debt (BWGED) says 153 families were directly impacted by the construction of the coal power plant. Of them, 142 were reportedly evicted by force. The BWGED study also noted that, when operational, the power station would emit 7,081 tonnes of carbon a day and damage several rich ecological zones nearby, including Tengragiri Wildlife Sanctuary, Sonakata Eco Park, Laldia mangrove forest, and Fatrar Char mangrove forest. It also raised the fear that hot water released from the plant into the Payra river would have negative effects on the hilsa population. Barges carrying coal to the plant will also reportedly move through a hilsa breeding ground. Hilsa is not only the favorite fish of Bangladesh but also a major revenue earner through exports. In May 2022, Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) found substantive corruption involving the power plant.","1. The precise face value of the loan is unknown. However, given that the $557.89 million project is being financed according to a 70:30 debt-to-equity ratio, AidData assume a face value of $390,523,000 for the time being. 2. BEPCL was legally incorporated in October 2017. 3. This power plant is also known as the Barguna Coal Power Plant and the Taltali Coal Power Plant. 4.

As of 2023, the China’s Global Energy Finance (CGEF) Database from Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center did not include the loan for the Barishal 350 MW (BEPCL) Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project, which is backed by a sovereign repayment guarantee from Bangladesh’s Ministry of Finance. According to Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center, the CGEF ‘only records loans towards borrowers with (any proportion of) public ownership of the recipient countries and hence excludes this [China Eximbank-financed] project.’","# Sector

In September 2021, China Eximbank and Bank of China signed a syndicated loan (facility) with Barisal Electric Power Company Limited (BEPCL) — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of Barisal Energy (DFC) Holding Limited (92% ownership stake), Sinohydro (Hong Kong) Holdings Limited (4% ownership stake) and ISO Tech Electrification Company Limited (4% ownership stake) — for the Barishal 350 MW (BEPCL) Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project. The loan carries a 15-year maturity. The other borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the Ministry of Finance of Bangladesh issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan on December 23, 2020 and a Sinosure credit insurance policy went into effect on October 27, 2021. It is also known that this $557.89 million independent power plant (IPP) project is being financed according to a 70:30 debt-to-equity ratio.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 350-megawatt (MW) coal-fired power station in the Nishanbaria village of Taltali upazila within Barguna district and Barisal division.   Shanghai Electric Power Construction Company Limited (SEPC) was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Satellite imagery demonstrates that preliminary construction activities began between January 2019 and November 2019. Construction of a 217-meter chimney started on December 16, 2020. Then, in February 2022, the lifting of the steel inner tube of the chimney was completed, marking the completion of the main chimney at the power plant. The power plant’s 400kV electricity transmission line was completed on May 19, 2022. The power plant was connected to the national grid on October 29, 2022. The power plant was originally scheduled to reach its commercial operation date (COD) on January 12, 2022. It passed its 168-hour reliability test and began commercial operations on December 31, 2022. Satellite imagery from December 2022 revealed a plume at the project site.   The project became a source of local controversy and public opposition. On August 2, 2018, villagers submitted a public petition to the Prime Minister urging the government to stop the project, alleging that BEPCL was purchasing lands with the help of illegal brokers with forged documents. In October 2018, the government said it would investigate the claims. In February 2019, Transparency International Bangladesh again called on the government to halt the plant's construction, claiming that the project had no approval from Bangladesh's Department of Environment — as well as claiming that local residents who have filed claims for compensation over land acquisition have been threatened and even assaulted. A study conducted by civil society organization the Bangladesh Working Group on External Debt (BWGED) says 153 families were directly impacted by the construction of the coal power plant. Of them, 142 were reportedly evicted by force. The BWGED study also noted that, when operational, the power station would emit 7,081 tonnes of carbon a day and damage several rich ecological zones nearby, including Tengragiri Wildlife Sanctuary, Sonakata Eco Park, Laldia mangrove forest, and Fatrar Char mangrove forest. It also raised the fear that hot water released from the plant into the Payra river would have negative effects on the hilsa population. Barges carrying coal to the plant will also reportedly move through a hilsa breeding ground. Hilsa is not only the favorite fish of Bangladesh but also a major revenue earner through exports. In May 2022, Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) found substantive corruption involving the power plant.",TRUE,NA,BROWN,HIGH,Coal Power,"Primary purpose is coal-fired power generation, which is environmentally harmful and inhibits energy transition","350 MW coal-fired power station, significant carbon emissions, negative ecological impacts, public opposition due to environmental concerns"
92468,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides $1.126 billion preferential buyer’s credit for Dhaka-Ashulia Expressway Project (Linked to Project ID#52763 and ID#92382),"On July 20, 2011, the Government of Bangladesh's Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) provided in-principle approval for the Dhaka-Ashulia Expressway Project. Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) conducted a pre-feasibility study in 2012 and estimated the possible project cost at around Tk 70 to 80 billion. Then, in January 2015, the Government of Bangladesh's Bridges Division signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC) to implement the project. It was assumed at the time that the cost of the project would rise by 8 percent due to an increase in labor and material prices. Later, a consortium, led by an Australian firm, conducted the final project feasibility test in 2016 and estimated the total project cost to be around Tk 100 billion.  The Government of Bangladesh provided final approval for the project in 2017 with an estimated cost of Tk 169 billion.   Then, on October 26, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed a $1,126,986,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the Dhaka-Ashulia Expressway Project. The PBC carries the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The proceeds of the PBC are to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $1.359 billion commercial (EPC) contract between Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA) and CMC, which was signed on November 29, 2017.    This project involves the construction of a 24 km expressway that will connect Hazrat Shahjahal International Airport with Abdullahpur, Ashulia, Baipail and Dhaka Export Processing Zone (DEPZ) on the Nabinagar-Chandra highway. The main objective of the project is to minimize the traffic congestion in and around Dhaka-Ashulia areas; the Dhaka-Ashulia Expressway will be connected to the Dhaka Elevated Expressway and is located within the alignment of the Asian Highway. Upon completion, the project is expected to greatly reduce traffic congestion in the Abdullahpur-Ashulia-Bypail-Chandra corridor connecting Dhaka with 30 districts. Vehicles will have to pay tolls to use the expressway and the thoroughfare is expected to boost the country's gross domestic product by 0.21 percent.   CMC, Jiangsu Provincial Construction Group, and Fifth Major Bridge Engineering Co Limited (MBEC-5) are the contractors responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on November 22, 2022. The project was originally expected to commence in September 2017 and conclude in June 2022. However, due to financing delays, the project's expected completion date was later pushed out to June 2026.","1. The Chinese project title is 孟加拉达卡至阿苏利亚高架高速公路项目. 2. The China Eximbank-financed Dhaka-Ashulia Expressway will eventually connect to the China Eximbank- and ICBC-financed Dhaka Elevated Expressway (captured via Project ID#52763 and ID#92382). Once both elevated expressways are operational, it is expected that people from the country's northern, western and south-western regions will be able to avoid the capital's perennial traffic jam as they go from one side of the city to another without having to travel on the existing city streets.","# Sector
