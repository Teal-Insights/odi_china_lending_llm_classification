This loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 25-year maturity, a 15-year grace-period, a 0% interest rate, and a 0% default (penalty) interest rate. It is scheduled for repayment between December 1, 2029 and November 30, 2039. In addition to this loan, this stadium project was financed by an additional grant and interest-free loan from the Chinese Government:   (1) a CFA 11.9 billion grant provided in March 2017 (captured via Project ID#85370), and  (2) a CFA 20.69 million interest-free loan issued on February 22, 2016 (captured via Project ID#73441).

The Ivorian Government was responsible for providing CFA 4 billion of counterpart financing for earthworks and the installation of water, electrical and telecommunications infrastructure at the project site.   This project involved the construction of a 60,012 seat stadium in Ebimpé within the Anyama sub-prefecture. It also involved the construction of an Olympic village surrounding the stadium, which has 4 housing estates, a training complex, administrative buildings, a commercial area, a clinic, a 4-star hotel, a 9-hole golf course, and of a medium voltage power line (15 kV) dedicated to the stadium (from the Yopougon 2 HV/MV transformer station to the industrial zone). Additionally, it involved the construction of a 10,000 seat multi-purpose arena.   Beijing Construction Engineering Group (BCEG) was the contractor responsible for implementation. It hired approximately 1000 workers, of which 350 were Chinese and 650 were Ivorian. Project implementation commenced on December 10, 2016. Then, a groundbreaking ceremony was held on December 22, 2016 (originally planned for January 2016). Shortly thereafter, on December 31, 2016, the Chinese Government made a loan disbursement worth CFA 14 billion. An electrical connection for the project site was established on August 18, 2017.

The loan was ratified by the Legislature of Cote d'Ivoire on December 7, 2014. It carried the following borrowing terms: 7-year grace period, a 20-year maturity, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% (RMB 1,5103,847.25) management fee.

The Ivorian Government also agreed to provide counterpart financing of CFA 985,040000, but ultimately only disbursed CFA 692,986,703.  This project involved the installation of water pump stations and other infrastructure to distribute water from South Comoé groundwater table in Bonoua to the southern zone of the capital city of Abidjan (in particular, the island of Petit Bassam, which includes the municipalities of Marcory, Koumassi, Treichville and Port-Bouët). More specifically, it involved the construction and equipping of a water treatment station in Bonoua (4000 m3/h); the construction and equipping of a recovery or overpressure station in Moossou; the construction and equipping of a recovery station in Port Bouet; facilitating the transfer of raw water from the catchment fields of Ono (7 boreholes) and Abrobakro (11 boreholes) to the Bonoua treatment plant; and facilitating the transfer of treated water from the Bonoua treatment plant to the Port Bouet pick-up station. The island of Petit Bassam, despite its hydraulic infrastructure, has been plagued by drinking water supply difficulties since the 2000s. This project sought to put an end to these recurring water shortages.   China Geo-Engineering Corporation (CGC) was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. An official groundbreaking ceremony took place on March 2, 2015 but construction itself did not begin until March 4, 2015. The project encountered difficulties in October 2016 with electrical connections for the boreholes of the Abrobakro catchment field. Two months later, in December 2016, construction was suspended for 15 days due to a failure by the Government of Cote d'Ivoire to pay CFA 5 billion of compensation to displaced households. However, by October 31, 2017, the project had achieved a 96% completion rate and a 95% financial execution rate. Then, on July 12, 2018, the project passed trials and inspections and it was officially handed over to the Ivorian authorities. The project’s originally scheduled project commencement and completion dates (as specified in the commercial contract) were January 2, 2016 and December 31, 2018, respectively.

In 1995, the Chinese Government and the Government of Cote d'Ivoire launched the Guiguidou farmland water conservancy project, and in May 1997, an agricultural rice technology cooperation project was launched in which Chinese experts work in Guiguidou with Ivorian farmers to promote agriculture — especially rice farming. The MATAC teams from Liaoning International have worked with the Government Cote d'Ivoire's Agency for Rice Development and National Agency for Rural Development in 2-year-long phases (as captured via Project ID#66175, #66160, #70502). Between 1997 and 2013, 7 technical assistance missions were carried out. Each team had a mechanization expert, an agronomy expert, an interpreter, and an accountant and they lived in a ‘city’ in Guiguidou made up of dormitories, offices, experimental laboratories, and a machine repair garage.",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,Social Development,Project focuses on agricultural technical assistance and capacity building without clear environmental or energy transition impacts,"Agricultural technical assistance mission, rice farming improvements, machinery introduction, rice processing plants"
