56767,COMMUNICATIONS,"China Eximbank provides $84.7 million preferential buyer’s credit to ZNBC for Phases II and III of the National Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting System Project (Linked to Project ID#56770, #56816, #56827, #57618)","On December 26, 2016, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Government of Zambia signed a $232,181,138.85 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for Phases II and III of the National Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting System. The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 5-year grace period, and a 20-year maturity. The principal amount was scheduled to be repaid in equal semi-annual installments after the end of the 5-year grace period. The PBC was to be repaid from dividends receivable from Topstar Communications Company Ltd. or ZNBC revenues (deposited in an escrow account). Future dividends receivable from Topstar Communications Company Ltd. also served as a source of collateral (security) for the loan.   As of July 2022, the loan had achieved a 83% disbursement rate ($192,735,724.78 out of $232,181,138.85). As a condition precedent to the loan agreement becoming effective, the Government of Zambia was required to on-lend 63.5% of the proceeds from the PBC (worth $147,434,528.10) to Topstar Communications Company Ltd. (captured via Project ID#56816) and on-lend 36.5% of the PBC proceeds (worth $84,746,610.75) to Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC) (captured via Project ID#56767). The on-lending (subsidiary) loan agreement was finalized on February 10, 2017. Topstar Communications Company Ltd. is a special purpose vehicle and a joint venture between ZNBC (40% equity stake) and StarTimes (60% equity stake), which was established on May 12, 2016. The proceeds of the $232,181,138.85 PBC were to be used to finance 85% of the cost of a $273,154,281 commercial (EPC) contract between Zambia’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Services and Star Times Communication Network Technology Co. Ltd (Star Times), which was signed on September 18, 2015. China Eximbank expected the Government of Zambia to directly finance the remaining 15% of the commercial contract cost. However, due to debt mismanagement challenges, StarTimes ultimately covered this cost by providing a $41 million supplier's credit (loan) to the Government of Zambia in 2017 (captured via Project ID#56827).   This project involved the the supply, delivery, installation and commissioning of a National Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting System. More specifically, it involved the design, manufacture and installation of plant and equipment and construction and commissioning buildings (studios) in Chinsali, Kasama, Mansa, Kabwe, Mongu and Chipata districts. The establishment of Topstar Communications Company Ltd. as a joint venture involved (1) the provision of digital television (TV) signal transmission service for TV stations and charge transmission fee; (2) the provision of decoders of Set-Top-Boxes (STBs) for every household with a TV set; (2) the provision to each subscriber, a basic television package of not less than twenty five channels which include local TV and international programs, and charge a monthly maintenance subscription fee of US$3 tax exclusive; (4) the provision a basic television package at half price to the poor families identified by government as such; and (5) the provision of two free channels for digital television universal access to viewers who fail to pay monthly maintenance subscription of US$3.  Star Times was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation.   This project was officially completed and handed over the local authorities at a ceremony that was held on June 14, 2019. However, a physical inspection that was carried out in November 2020 revealed four major implementation problems: (1) Although the July 2020 project status report revealed that civil works at the Kasama Studio were completed and the site handed over by the contractor, a visit to the site revealed that it was not operational as equipment had not yet been installed. (2) Although the project status report for October 2020 stated that the civil works at the Chinsali studio were completed and the site handed over by the contractor, a visit to the site revealed that it was not operational as equipment had not been installed. (3) The July 2020 status report revealed that the civil works at the Kabwe Studio had only achieved an 83% completion rate (with remaining works including fitting of fixtures and fittings, aluminium at the entrance, supply generator, connection of power, paving the car park, tiling of the outside step, plumbing works and completion of the generator storage room) and works had stalled and the contractor was not on site. (4) The October 2020 status report revealed that the civil works at the Chipata studio had only achieved an 82% completion rate (with remaining works including fitting of fixtures and fittings and aluminum at the entrance of the building, connection of power and paving of the car park) and works had stalled and the contractor was not on site. Then, on July 29, 2022, the Ministry of Finance & National Planning (MOFNP) of Zambia announced that it was seeking lender approval to formally cancel the $232,181,138.85 loan’s undisbursed balance ($39,445,414.07); however, it also noted that it had not yet secured formal lender approval for this action. This announcement came approximately 21 months after the Government of Zambia defaulted on its repayment obligations to Eurobond holders and approximately 6 weeks after China, France, and 14 other countries formed a creditor committee to discuss the Zambian authorities’ request for a debt treatment under ‘the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the DSSI’ endorsed by the G20 and the Paris Club.","1.

56970,WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION,Bank of China contributes $332 million to $381.7 million syndicated loan tranche — via EPC+F arrangement — for Kafulafuta Water Supply System Project,"On June 5, 2013, China National Complete Engineering Corporation (CNCEC) — a subsidiary of CMEC — signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Government of Zambia for water supply projects in Copperbelt Province. One of these projects was the Kafulafuta Water Supply System Project. Then, on July 11, 2016, Bank of China and Standard Chartered signed a $449,090,629.71 syndicated (EPC+F) loan agreement with CNCEC for the Kafulafuta Water Supply System Project. The loan was provided in two separate tranches and backed by a sovereign repayment guarantee from the Government of Zambia’s Ministry of Finance & National Planning (MOFNP). As part of the first ($381,727,035.28) tranche, Bank of China contributed approximately $332 million (captured via Project ID#56970) and Standard Chartered contributed approximately $50 million. This loan tranche has a 15-year maturity. Sinosure provided political and commercial risk insurance for 95% of the principal and interest under this loan tranche. As of July 2022, the $381,727,035.28 syndicated loan tranche had achieved a 58.8% disbursement rate ($224,609,249.30 out of $381,727,035.28). Standard Chartered also provided the second tranche worth $67.3 million with a 4-year maturity. The proceeds of these two loan tranches were use to finance 100% of the cost of a $449,090,629.71 commercial (EPC) contract between Zambia’s Ministry of Local Government and Housing with China National Complete Engineering Corporation (CNCEC), which was signed in February 2016.    This project involves the construction of a reservoir dam at Kafulafuta with a 125 million cubic meter storage capacity, a water intake pumping station, a midway booster pumping station, an independent water supply system in Mupenggui region, a transmission main line from the dam to Ndola, and waterlines from the Kafulafuta dam to Msayiti (V.), Luanshya and Ndola water works. It also involves the upgrading and reconstruction of a city pipe network, the procurement of domestic water meters and regional water meters, and resettlement engineering activities. The project is expected to create 3,000 jobs and improve water access and quality for 700,000 people in the Ndola, Luanshya and Masaiti districts. The dam site is located in Ibenga area of Masaiti District of the Copperbelt Province of Zambia. It lies 50km west of Ndola City. The site is within Her Royal Highness Chieftainess Malembeka and His Royal Highness Senior Chief Mushili.   Project implementation began in August 2017. However, a formal project commencement ceremony did not take place until September 21, 2018. Then, in June 2019, a shipment of 3,336 tons of building materials — including water pipelines — arrived  via the Port of Walvis Bay in Namibia. According to Zambia's Ministry of Water and Sanitation Development as of September 11, 2019, the project had achieved a 55% completion rate. On February 5, 2020, CNCEC notified the Zambian Government that it was halting work on the project due to overdue payments, which would leave 450 employees and 50 subcontractors out of work. Japhen Mwakalombe, Zambia’s Minister of the Copperbelt province, disputed this point, arguing that the work stoppage was because of heavy rains in the area. Then, in November 2021, Kafubu Water and Sanitation Company (KWSC) Director of Engineering Bernard Phiri reported that the stalled project was being affected by rampant vandalism and theft.

Bank of China contributes $332 million to $381.7 million syndicated loan tranche — via EPC+F arrangement — for Kafulafuta Water Supply System Project

# Description
On June 5, 2013, China National Complete Engineering Corporation (CNCEC) — a subsidiary of CMEC — signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Government of Zambia for water supply projects in Copperbelt Province. One of these projects was the Kafulafuta Water Supply System Project. Then, on July 11, 2016, Bank of China and Standard Chartered signed a $449,090,629.71 syndicated (EPC+F) loan agreement with CNCEC for the Kafulafuta Water Supply System Project. The loan was provided in two separate tranches and backed by a sovereign repayment guarantee from the Government of Zambia’s Ministry of Finance & National Planning (MOFNP). As part of the first ($381,727,035.28) tranche, Bank of China contributed approximately $332 million (captured via Project ID#56970) and Standard Chartered contributed approximately $50 million. This loan tranche has a 15-year maturity. Sinosure provided political and commercial risk insurance for 95% of the principal and interest under this loan tranche. As of July 2022, the $381,727,035.28 syndicated loan tranche had achieved a 58.8% disbursement rate ($224,609,249.30 out of $381,727,035.28). Standard Chartered also provided the second tranche worth $67.3 million with a 4-year maturity. The proceeds of these two loan tranches were use to finance 100% of the cost of a $449,090,629.71 commercial (EPC) contract between Zambia’s Ministry of Local Government and Housing with China National Complete Engineering Corporation (CNCEC), which was signed in February 2016.    This project involves the construction of a reservoir dam at Kafulafuta with a 125 million cubic meter storage capacity, a water intake pumping station, a midway booster pumping station, an independent water supply system in Mupenggui region, a transmission main line from the dam to Ndola, and waterlines from the Kafulafuta dam to Msayiti (V.), Luanshya and Ndola water works. It also involves the upgrading and reconstruction of a city pipe network, the procurement of domestic water meters and regional water meters, and resettlement engineering activities. The project is expected to create 3,000 jobs and improve water access and quality for 700,000 people in the Ndola, Luanshya and Masaiti districts. The dam site is located in Ibenga area of Masaiti District of the Copperbelt Province of Zambia. It lies 50km west of Ndola City. The site is within Her Royal Highness Chieftainess Malembeka and His Royal Highness Senior Chief Mushili.   Project implementation began in August 2017. However, a formal project commencement ceremony did not take place until September 21, 2018. Then, in June 2019, a shipment of 3,336 tons of building materials — including water pipelines — arrived  via the Port of Walvis Bay in Namibia. According to Zambia's Ministry of Water and Sanitation Development as of September 11, 2019, the project had achieved a 55% completion rate. On February 5, 2020, CNCEC notified the Zambian Government that it was halting work on the project due to overdue payments, which would leave 450 employees and 50 subcontractors out of work. Japhen Mwakalombe, Zambia’s Minister of the Copperbelt province, disputed this point, arguing that the work stoppage was because of heavy rains in the area. Then, in November 2021, Kafubu Water and Sanitation Company (KWSC) Director of Engineering Bernard Phiri reported that the stalled project was being affected by rampant vandalism and theft. Valves and other water installations from the project site were reportedly stolen and vandalized. The project was originally scheduled for completion in January 2021. However, as of February 2022, AidData had identified no evidence of project completion.

The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. Then, in 2017, ICBC and the Government of Zambia signed a $59.58 million loan agreement for the Ndola International Airport Construction Project (captured via Project ID#57092). The borrowing terms of the ICBC loan are unknown. The proceeds of the China Eximbank PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $397,201,694 commercial (EPC) contract between Zambia Airports Corporation Limited (ZACL) and AVIC International Holding Corporation, which was signed on September 11, 2013 and amended on August 25, 2014. The proceeds of the ICBC loan were to be used by the borrower to finance 15% of the cost of the $397,201,694 commercial (EPC) contract between Zambia Airports Corporation Limited (ZACL) and AVIC International Holding Corporation. As of July 2022, the China Eximbank loan had achieved a 57.1% disbursement rate ($192,785,140.88 out of $337,621,439.90).   The project involved the construction of a 12,000 square meter terminal building, 3 aero bridges, a 3.5 kilometer runway, a cargo terminal, a 50-room hotel, a new fire and rescue station, a cargo terminal, an aircraft maintenance hangar, and a fuel farm. AVIC International Holding Corporation was the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. It reportedly fulfilled the government policy of having 20 percent sub-contracting to local contractors by engaging 60 local sub-contractors. 2,700 people were employed during the project construction period.   A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on June 25, 2017. However, the construction site was not handed over to the EPC contractor until September 28, 2017. The EPC contract went into effect and construction began on October 26, 2017. By December 17, 2019, the overall project had achieved a 58% completion rate; the passenger terminal completion rate was 61%, the business complex completion rate was 49%, the air traffic control building completion rate was 54%, the runway, taxiway and apron completion rate was 98%, and the viaduct completion rate was 80%. As of March 2020, the project had achieved an overall completion rate of 60%. As of April 2021, the project had achieved an overall completion rate of 88.9%. The project was originally expected to reach completion on October 20, 2020. However, due to implementation delays related to financing problems and the COVID-19 pandemic, the intended project completion date was pushed out to January 31, 2022. The airport was officially commissioned on August 5, 2021, but the airport was still reportedly waiting for operational certifications at that time. This project has also been plagued by financial problems due to overdue contractor payments. According to Clause 43.1 of the commercial contract between AVIC International Holding Corporation and ZACL, if the client (ZACL) failed to make payment within a stipulated period of time, the EPC contractor (AVIC International Holding Corporation) was entitled to the payment of interest for the late payment, which was to be calculated from the date by which the payment should have been made until the date on which payment was made by applying the interest rate as per local practice. If the payment was delayed for more than 56 days, the EPC contractor would have the right to suspend the works or terminate the commercial contract. Contrary to the clause, AVIC International Holding Corporation had not been paid a total of $97,324,668 being outstanding interim payment certificates (IPCs) for a period of more than fourteen months. In addition, there was no documentation availed to the Auditor General of Zambia to indicate why, despite the financing agreement being in force, the lender had not paid the contractor.   On April 5, 2021, AVIC International Holding Corporation claimed interest on late payments on outstanding IPCs in amounts totaling $1,913,155. AVIC International Senior Consultant, Lei Yingqi, later confirmed that AVIC International Holding Corporation as an EPC contractor was using borrowed funds at high interest rates to ensure that the project continued to progress and the employees continued to be paid. He also indicated that ‘support from abroad was cut off or delayed’, which suggests that the source of the borrowed funds was not China Eximbank or ICBC. Then, on July 29, 2022, the Ministry of Finance & National Planning (MOFNP) of Zambia announced that it was seeking lender approval to formally cancel the China Eximbank loan’s undisbursed balance ($144,836,299.02); however, it also noted that it had not yet secured formal lender approval for this action.

On August 25, 2014, the price of the commercial contract between ZACL and AVIC International Holding Corporation was adjusted downwards by $177,566,352 from $574,768,046 to $397,201,694 through Addendum No. 1, which reduced the size of the airport from 22,250 square meters with a capacity of two million passengers per annum to 12,000 square meters with a capacity of one million passengers per annum among others. However, Addendum No. 1 revealed that although some original quantities were maintained as in the original contract, the prices were adjusted upwards. As of April 30, 2021, AVIC International Holding Corporation had been paid $252,365,334.88 — or 63.54% of the commercial contract price (leaving a balance of $144,836,359). 3. Before August 2021, the Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe International Airport was at an old location, in the Itawa suburb of Ndola (south-east of the city centre). Previously, it was known as Ndola Airport and in September 2011, President Michael Sata decided to rename the airport in honor of Simon Kapwepwe, the nation's former vice-president.  In late 2021, Ndola's airport was officially moved from Itawa to a new address, 15 kilometers west of the city centre, just north of the Dag Hammarskjöld Crash Site Memorial, which is its current address. The airport's current location, while under construction, was known as the Copperbelt International Airport until late 2021, when it became the official airport of Ndola. As such, the name for Ndola's Airport (Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe International Airport) became the name for the newly built airport. Ndola retained the name it was given by President Michael Sata in 2011 to refer to its international airport (the name Copperbelt International Airport was no-longer in use).

57556,ENERGY,ICBC provides $29.6 million loan for Mpika Power Supply Improvement Project (Linked to Project ID#57492),"On July 13, 2016, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) Limited — Zambia’s state-owned power company — signed a $29.6 million (seller's credit) facility agreement for the Mpika Power Supply Improvement Project. According to this agreement, ICBC was to disburse funds directly to TBEA Company Ltd., which would in turn use the loan proceeds to finance the implementation of the project. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 3-year grace period, and an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 335 basis points.   As of December 31, 2017, the loan's amount outstanding was $5.8 million. As of December 31, 2019, the loan's amount outstanding was $27.71 million.   The project sought to improve the supply of power in Mpika district within Muchinga Province by improving its (330-66 KV) electricity substation.  TBEA Company Ltd. was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began in 2017 and the project had achieved an 85% completion rate (and 40% loan disbursement rate) by December 2018. The project was ultimately completed on March 15, 2019.","1. This project is also known as the Improvement of Power in Mpika District Project and the Mpika Power Supply, 330-66 KV Substation Project. The Chinese project title is 赞比亚Mpika地区电力改善项目. 2. The SAIS-CARI Chinese Loans to Africa database released in July 2020 identifies this loan as having an 18-year maturity length. However, AidData relies on ZESCO sources (source ID#67341 and #88869), which identify a 15-year maturity. 3. The all-in interest-rate was calculated as follows: 0.999% (Average 6-month USD LIBOR from July 2016) + 3.35% (335 basis points) = 4.349%. 4. Even though Zambian official sources (ID#67341, #88869) portrayed this is as just an ordinary ICBC loan, TBEA (source ID#117086) confirmed that ICBC provided a seller's credit. 5. The monetary value of the EPC contract with TBEA was $38 million.6. Official sources differ on the precise face value and commitment date of the loan. The Government of Zambia's Loans and Guarantees (Authorisation) (Exemption) Notice of 2017 identifies a $19.6 million ICBC loan that was issued on July 13, 2017 for the Mpika Power Supply Improvement Project (https://www.zambialaws.com/Zambia2017Pdfsi/SI%2049%20of%202017.pdf).

This discrepancy warrants further investigation.7. This project is part of phase II of a larger project called the Zambia-Tanzania-Kenya (ZTK) Transmission Interconnector Project, which will seeks to connect the power grids of all three countries (as captured via Project ID#57492).","# Sector
