Then, in 2009, China Eximbank and the Government of Equatorial Guinea signed a subsidiary buyer’s credit loan agreement for the Djibloho Power Transmission and Transformation Project.

62256,WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION,CGGC provides RMB 2.8577 billion supplier’s credit for Malabo Sewage Treatment Plant and Sewage Pipe Network Project,"In 2009, China Gezhouba Group Corporation (CGGC) and the Government of Equatorial Guinea signed a supplier’s credit agreement for the Malabo Sewage Treatment Project. The estimated value of the supplier’s credit (loan) is RMB 2.8577 billion (EUR 270.3 million). In order to finance its supplier’s credit agreement with the Government of Equatorial Guinea, CGGC secured one or more export seller’s credits from China Eximbank. The proceeds of the supplier’s credit were to be used by the borrower to finance approximately 85% of the cost of an RMB 3.362 billion (EUR 318 million) commercial (EPC) contract between the Government of Equatorial Guinea and CGGC, which was signed on February 24, 2008. The borrowing terms of the supplier’s credit are unknown. However, it is known that the supplier’s credit was backed by a Sinosure credit insurance policy, which was finalized in September 2013 and provided $119 million of coverage.   The project involved the (1) the construction of a sewage treatment plant in Malabo (with the capacity of 40,000 cubic meters of sewage and the ability to treat and discharge 10,000-14,000 cubic meters of sewage per day), and (2) construction of a 238 km (or 239.5 km) network of sewage pipes in Malabo. These two project components are known as Phase 1 and Phase 2, respectively. The project also involved the installation of 5 sewage pumping stations. However, it is unclear if this component was undertaken as part of Phase 1 or Phase 2. Upon completion, this project was expected to benefit 100,000 local residents of Malabo.    CGGC was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, Long Jian Road and Bridge Co., Ltd., SCEGC Installation Group Company Ltd., CMEC Comtrans International Co., Ltd., and Anhu Shui'an Construction Group Co., Ltd. were also involved in implementation. Phase 1 took place between August 18, 2008 and August 2012. Phase 2 commenced on June 13, 2013. The Malabo sewage treatment plant and sewage pipe network entered its trial operation period on October 8, 2015. It was officially handed over to the local authorities in 2019. The Malabo sewage treatment plant and sewage pipe network reportedly now collects 14,000 cubic meters of municipal sewage each day (on average) and provide 85% to 90% of the city’s sewage treatment capacity.   However, this project also faced significant implementation and debt repayment challenges. Sinosure made an EUR 6.53 million indemnity payment to CGGC in December 2014 due to the fact that the Government of Equatorial Guinea defaulted on its payment obligations to CGGC. Then, in September 2017, Sinosure made another EUR 3.25 million indemnity payment to CGGC for the same reason.","1.

SAIS-CARI and Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center record a $132 million (RMB 900 million) supplier’s credit from CGGC for this project. However, given that the project was implemented in two phases and the total cost of the commercial contract for both phases was RMB 2.8577 billion (EUR 270.3 million), their estimate appears to only capture the financial commitment for phase 1 (which is also recorded by China Eximbank as RMB 900 million).
