95399,ENERGY,ICBC participates in EUR 69.5 million syndicated loan for 46MW Možura Wind Park Project (Linked to Project ID#67392),"In 2018, Možura Wind Park d.o.o. (黑山莫祖拉风电有限公司)— a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and joint venture of Malta Montenegro Wind Power JV Limited (90% equity stake) and Enemalta (10% equity stake) — signed an EUR 69,500,000 syndicated loan agreement with a group of banks for the 46MW Možura Wind Park Project. Known participants in the loan syndicate included Deutsche Bank and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance an EUR 90,000,000 commercial contract with Shanghai Electric Power Engineering Montenegro LLC.  The purpose of the project was to install 23 Chinese-made, 2 MW low-speed intelligent wind turbine generators — with a total installed capacity of 46,000 kW — in Možura within southern Montenegro. The project also involved the construction of a substation. The wind power plant was designed with a capacity of 46MW on 502,858 square meters of land at a cost of EUR 0.37 per square meter.   Shanghai Electric Power Engineering Montenegro LLC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction formally commenced on December 7, 2017. Then on December 22, 2018, the first set of wind turbine generators was connected to the grid. By February 8, 2019, all of the wind turbine generators were connected to the grid. The wind farm began its trial operation period in April 2019, which extended until the end of September 2019. Following technical acceptance on November 15, 2019, the project secured a usage license from the Montenegrin Government. The wind farm went into commercial operation on November 18, 2019. Investors have leased state land to the project company (SPV) for a period of 20 years and will pay it an EUR 186,057 fee annually. The state has pledged to guarantee a fixed electricity price of EUR 95.99/MWh and EUR 115 million in incentives over the first 12 years of the wind farm’s operation. After the lease period expires, the Možura wind farm will become the property of the Montenegrin state.   Notwithstanding its successful completion, the Možura Wind Park Project has been plagued by controversy and scandal.  In the months before her murder in 2017, Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was investigating an offshore company called 17 Black Limited. She didn’t know who owned the firm, which was registered in the United Arab Emirates. But she was certain it was set up to channel corrupt payments to Maltese political leaders. Caruana Galizia was killed in a car bombing in October 2017.  Then, in 2019, police charged one of Malta’s wealthiest businessmen, Yorgen Fenech — previously revealed by Reuters to be the owner of Limited — with ordering the murder of Caruana Galizia. He denied the charge. The assassination triggered a political crisis in Malta that drove Prime Minister Joseph Muscat from office in 2020.   17 Black Limited’s activities remain shrouded in mystery. But evidence uncovered by Reuters and the Times of Malta shed light on its operations through one particular deal. In December 2015, 17 Black Limited made a previously undisclosed profit of EUR 4.6 million ($5 million) when  Enemalta plc — a joint venture of the Government of Malta (67% ownership stake) and Shanghai Electric Power (33% ownership stake) — purchased an equity stake in the 46MW Možura Wind Park Project via Možura Wind Park d.o.o.. The purchase came after negotiations and several trips to Montenegro led by Malta’s then energy minister, Konrad Mizzi. In that same month, accountants for Mizzi and the prime minister’s then chief of staff, Keith Schembri, wrote in an email that Schembri and Mizzi stood to receive payments from 17 Black Limited for services that weren’t specified. Reuters and other news outlets have previously reported these emails, which were part of an application to open bank accounts for Panamanian firms owned by the two men. Keith Schembri confirmed to Reuters in April 2018 that companies he owns had devised a ‘draft business plan’ with 17 Black Limited that was not implemented, but he gave no further details. He is now under investigation for potential involvement in Caruana Galizia’s murder, police have said. He has denied any role in the journalist’s killing. Konrad Mizzi has previously stated he had no involvement in or knowledge of the plot to murder Caruana Galizia.","1. The Chinese Government has designated the Mozura Wind Farm Project as a BRI project. 2. In 2010, the Government signed a 20 year lease agreement with a consortium including Fersa Energias Renovables S.A. (“Fersa”) and Celebic, for the purposes of constructing a wind farm capable of producing 46MW of renewable energy. In 2015, the lease and construction agreements were transferred to a Maltese state owned entity, Enemalta plc.  In 2017, the Government approved the transfer of a 90 per cent stake in Mozura Wind Park, the company responsible for the construction of the wind farm, from Enemalta plc to Malta Montenegro Wind Power JV Limited. Under the terms of this transfer, investment obligations remain with Enemalta plc but further extend to Malta Montenegro Wind Power JV Limited. 3. This project is also known as the 46MW Mozura Wind Farm Project. The Montenegrin project title is Vjetroelektrana Možura. 4. The Government of Malta holds a 67% ownership stake and Shanghai Electric Power (SEP) holds a 33% ownership stake in Enemalta plc. In March 2014, SEP acquired a 33% ownership stake in Enemalta plc for EUR 320 million. 5. The size of ICBC’s financial contribution to the loan syndication is unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes equal contributions across the two (known) members of the syndicate (EUR 34,750,000).","# Sector

66112,ENERGY,ICBC provides $150 million equity bridge loan for 200MW Noor II CSP Independent Power Project,"In 2018, the Dubai Branch of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) signed a $150 million equity bridge loan (EBL) agreement with ACWA Power Ouarzazate II S.A. (“APO II”) — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of ACWA Power Bahrain Holdings (70% equity stake), SENER Group (5% equity stake), and Masen Capital (25% equity stake)— for the 200MW Noor II CSP Independent Power Project. The borrowing terms of this ICBC loan are unknown. The total cost of the Noor II CSP Independent Power Project (IPP) was EUR 834.5 million.  The project was implemented on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis) and co-financed by the Government of Morocco, the World Bank, the African Development Bank, European Investment Bank (EIB), KFW, the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), and various private sector sponsors. It was the second in a series of projects at the Ouarzazate solar complex.   The Noor II CSP IPP was based on the parabolic trough CSP technology with a capacity of 200 MW and 7 hours of storage developed on a BOO basis. The solar power plant comprises a solar field, a turbine and a thermal power-storage facility.  Shandong Electric Power Construction Co., Ltd (SEPCO III), a subsidiary of Power Construction Corporation of China, was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began in May 2015 and the power plant was put into commercial operation on April 24, 2018.   The initial commercial operation date (ICOD) of the power plant was contractually set at August 27, 2017 but could not be met due to delays affecting the project and the force majeure claimed by APO II, and was thus extended by 160 days to February 3, 2018, considered the new required initial commercial operation date (RICOD) of the NOOR Ouarzazate II power plant. It should also be noted that following the suspension of land transportation authorisations for exceptional convoys (heavy equipment) due to significant damage caused to several structures by severe weather on October 26, 2016, the delivery of heavy equipment, initially scheduled for November 2016, was delayed and was made only at the end of May 2017. As a result of the suspension of land transportation, APO II requested additional 187 days because of the force majeure.   The initial commercial operation date (ICOD) of the NOOR Ouarzazate II power plant, initially set at August 27, 2017, could not be met due to several factors, some of which have been listed above (difficulties in transportation and logistics). It was postponed, after MASEN accepted the force majeure claimed by APO II, to February 3, 2018 considered as the new required initial commercial operation date (RICOD) for the power plant. The first synchronisation of the plant to the power grid was conducted on January 10, 2018. The plant's initial commercial operation date was April 24, 2018, following successful completion of performance and reliability tests conducted in March 2018 and 24 April 2018 when the thermal energy storage system started working again. Some conditions were waived, such as certain atmospheric emissions and noise tests (these tests were successfully completed on September 26, 2018 and September 29, 2018). The Initial Commercial Operation Certificate, which confirmed completion of the initial commercial operation date (ICOD) of NOOR Ouarzazate II on April 24, 2018, was issued by the Project Company on September 18, 2018. The ICOD Agreement defining the terms of the ICOD declaration was signed on December 27, 2018.   The power plant experienced a partial outage in January 2020 related to a turbine outage and again for 18 days in June and July 2020 as a result of leakage in its steam generator system, with further inspections and repairs of the steam generator system in November 2020 resulting in lower availability in 2020 with net dispatch of 506,535 MWh versus the plan of 660,890 MWh.","1. This project is also known as the Noor Ouarzazate Solar Power Project Phase II and the 200 MW Noor II CSP IPP. The French project title is Projet de complexe solaire de Ouarzazate – Phase II. 2.  A bridge loan is a special short-term facility mainly used to cover the short-term funding gap of the borrower and to bridge the funding to meet the conditions of long-term facilities. ICBC is not listed in the list of the original long-term creditors for the Noor Ouarzazate Solar Power Project Phase II. By the end of 2018, the ICBC had devoted an equivalent of $9.41 billion to finance Eligible Green Assets; and 1.4% of the fund was allocated to Morocco for this project ($131,740,000). 3. The project’s offtaker is MASEN, with whom APO II entered into a 25 year power purchase agreement in the presence of Office National de l’Électricité et de l’Eau Potable (“ONEE”). 4.  The PPP agreement between MASEN and APO II for the design, financing, construction, operation and maintenance of the NOOR Ouarzazate II power plant for a 25-year period provided for commissioning after 25 months as from 27 July 2015 (date on which the contract effectiveness was notified).","# Sector

# Title
ICBC provides $150 million equity bridge loan for 200MW Noor II CSP Independent Power Project

# Description
In 2018, the Dubai Branch of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) signed a $150 million equity bridge loan (EBL) agreement with ACWA Power Ouarzazate II S.A. (“APO II”) — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of ACWA Power Bahrain Holdings (70% equity stake), SENER Group (5% equity stake), and Masen Capital (25% equity stake)— for the 200MW Noor II CSP Independent Power Project. The borrowing terms of this ICBC loan are unknown. The total cost of the Noor II CSP Independent Power Project (IPP) was EUR 834.5 million.  The project was implemented on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis) and co-financed by the Government of Morocco, the World Bank, the African Development Bank, European Investment Bank (EIB), KFW, the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), and various private sector sponsors. It was the second in a series of projects at the Ouarzazate solar complex.   The Noor II CSP IPP was based on the parabolic trough CSP technology with a capacity of 200 MW and 7 hours of storage developed on a BOO basis. The solar power plant comprises a solar field, a turbine and a thermal power-storage facility.  Shandong Electric Power Construction Co., Ltd (SEPCO III), a subsidiary of Power Construction Corporation of China, was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began in May 2015 and the power plant was put into commercial operation on April 24, 2018.   The initial commercial operation date (ICOD) of the power plant was contractually set at August 27, 2017 but could not be met due to delays affecting the project and the force majeure claimed by APO II, and was thus extended by 160 days to February 3, 2018, considered the new required initial commercial operation date (RICOD) of the NOOR Ouarzazate II power plant. It should also be noted that following the suspension of land transportation authorisations for exceptional convoys (heavy equipment) due to significant damage caused to several structures by severe weather on October 26, 2016, the delivery of heavy equipment, initially scheduled for November 2016, was delayed and was made only at the end of May 2017. As a result of the suspension of land transportation, APO II requested additional 187 days because of the force majeure.   The initial commercial operation date (ICOD) of the NOOR Ouarzazate II power plant, initially set at August 27, 2017, could not be met due to several factors, some of which have been listed above (difficulties in transportation and logistics). It was postponed, after MASEN accepted the force majeure claimed by APO II, to February 3, 2018 considered as the new required initial commercial operation date (RICOD) for the power plant. The first synchronisation of the plant to the power grid was conducted on January 10, 2018. The plant's initial commercial operation date was April 24, 2018, following successful completion of performance and reliability tests conducted in March 2018 and 24 April 2018 when the thermal energy storage system started working again. Some conditions were waived, such as certain atmospheric emissions and noise tests (these tests were successfully completed on September 26, 2018 and September 29, 2018). The Initial Commercial Operation Certificate, which confirmed completion of the initial commercial operation date (ICOD) of NOOR Ouarzazate II on April 24, 2018, was issued by the Project Company on September 18, 2018. The ICOD Agreement defining the terms of the ICOD declaration was signed on December 27, 2018.   The power plant experienced a partial outage in January 2020 related to a turbine outage and again for 18 days in June and July 2020 as a result of leakage in its steam generator system, with further inspections and repairs of the steam generator system in November 2020 resulting in lower availability in 2020 with net dispatch of 506,535 MWh versus the plan of 660,890 MWh.",TRUE,NA,GREEN,HIGH,Solar Power,Primary purpose is solar power generation using concentrated solar power (CSP) technology with energy storage,"200MW CSP plant with 7 hours of storage, parabolic trough technology, renewable energy focus"
