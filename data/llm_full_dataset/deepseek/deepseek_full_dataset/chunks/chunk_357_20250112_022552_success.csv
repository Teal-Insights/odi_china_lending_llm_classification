The CMP loan, captured via Project ID#59393, carried the following borrowing terms: a 5% annual interest rate, a 1.25-year maturity (with the option to extend the maturity by 8.75 additional years), and no grace period.   The Government of Djibouti — through the state-owned Djibouti Port and Free Trade Zone Authority (DPFZA) — issued a sovereign guarantee for repaying the supplier's credit.

The CDB loan, which is captured via Project ID#85139, carried the following borrowing terms: a 13 year maturity and a 3 year grace period. China Merchants Shekou Industrial Zone Holdings Co., Ltd. provided a loan guarantee worth $14.4 million (6% of $240 million CDB loan). The Government of Djibouti provided a sovereign guarantee for 60% of the face value of the loan ($144 million). The DIFTZ is a 40-hectare zone that consists of three functional blocks located close to all of Djibouti’s major ports.   The purpose of the DIFTZ is to support industries such as the logistics, marine, construction, automotive, and home electrical industries. It is equipped with advanced facilities including high-speed telecommunications, power and water supplies, roads and parking lots. The pilot zone has four industrial clusters which focus on trade and logistics, export processing and business support: (1) Logistics Industry Cluster: transportation, bonded warehousing, logistics and distribution; (2) Business Industry Cluster: bulk bonded goods transactions, merchandise display, duty-free merchandise retail; (3) Business Support Cluster: financial services, information services, hotel dormitories, office buildings, training, intermediary services; and (4) Processing Manufacturing Cluster: packaging production, light processing of incoming materials, food processing, marine products, auto parts assembly.

The Lease Land shall be used for the purposes of carrying out logistics, commerce and trade activities within the Djibouti International Free Trade Zone. CM Djibouti shall pay to the Djibouti Asset Company (i) an aggregate amount of $27,756,004.31 (equivalent to approximately HK$216,497,000) for the full term of the Lease, (ii) a deposit of US$200,000 (equivalent to approximately HK$1,560,000) in addition to the rent and (iii) property management fees at an annual rate of US$1.00 (equivalent to approximately HK$7.80) per square meter of the surface area of the Djibouti Lease Land. The Djibouti Asset Company is an associate of CMG, the ultimate holding company of China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited.4. Under the BRI banner, Chinese SOEs, especially China Merchants Group (CMG), have been attempting to replicate elements of its “port in front-(industrial) park in the middle-city behind” or Port-Park-City (PPC) model in Africa. The model is based on the Shekou Industrial Park in Shenzhen city in China’s Guangdong Province, established in 1979. It was the country’s first special economic zone, and it sparked Shenzhen’s growth as a commercial and industrial hub. CMG’s efforts to build the village of Shekou into a world-class industrial zone resulted in an area without basic infrastructure being transformed into a modern metropolitan center. The Shekou Model “entails developing adjacent industrial parks, commercial buildings, highways, free trade zones, residential areas, and power plants.” With the focus on the port, the model does not aim only to facilitate the transportation of goods but to “develop a larger, integrated system that helps sustain the port and is sustained by it in turn”. In 2017, Li Xiaopeng, president of CMG, mentioned that his company is using the Shekou Model as a template or a concept that can be applied and tweaked to adjust to its port projects worldwide.” 5. In the World Bank's Debtor Reporting System (DRS), the full face value of the loan is not recorded. The (60%) portion of the loan ($144 million) that is backed by a sovereign guarantee is recorded in the DRS. See https://www.dropbox.com/s/2sw4f7gluxa52fk/DRS%20Official%20Commitments%20from%20China%20Through%202021.xlsx?dl=0.6. The loan's interest rate (5.4025%) is identified in the DRS.
