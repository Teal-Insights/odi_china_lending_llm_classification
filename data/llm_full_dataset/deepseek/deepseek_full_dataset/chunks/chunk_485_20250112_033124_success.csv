Another objective of the project is to rehabilitate four training grounds (including the Auguste Denise stadium, a technical college, and a municipal high school). The San Pedro Olympic stadium is being built 200 meters from the road at the south-eastern entrance to the city of San Pedro near the road to Abidjan. It is being built in preparation for the facility to host the 2023 African Cup of Nations football tournament.   The Côte d’Ivoire Branch of China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) [CCECC-CI or 中国土木工程集团（科特迪瓦）有限公司] is the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. China Railway 19th Bureau, China Railway Urban Construction Group (CRUC), and Omni Travaux (a French company) also appear to be serving as sub-contractors.
