The monetary value of this grant commitment is unknown.   The project involved the provision of eight electricity generators with 10.6MW of power generation capacity: 4 generators (with 6MW of power generation capacity) for the Voidjou (Vwadju) power plant on the island of Ngazidja (Grande Comore); 1 generator (with (with 3MW of power generation capacity) for the Wemani power plant in city of Fomboni on the island of Mohéli (Mwali); and 2 generators (with 3MW of power generation capacity) for the Trenani power plant on the island of Ndzuani (Anjouan).   The generators were successfully handed over to the Comorian authorities on August 5, 2010. The Chinese Government asked the Government of Comoros to pay for the cost of installing these generators, but they were unable to do so, which led to major delays in generator installation and use. China’s Ministry of Commerce subsequently agreed to provide a grant worth 200 million Comorian francs for the installation of the generators (through the so-called 'Electricity Generator Installation Project').   A contract with China Shenyang International Economic & Technical Cooperation corporation (CSYIC) was signed on September 29, 2012 to facilitate the implementation of the China Shenyang International Economic & Technical Cooperation Corporation (CSYIC). These generators were all successfully installed; however, the power plants where they were installed did not go into use until several years later. The Voidjou (Vwadju) power plant, Trenani power plant, and Wemani power plant were officially inaugurated on February 5, 2017, April 20, 2017, and May 4, 2017, respectively.

China’s Ministry of Commerce issued an RMB 28,970,103.80 grant for Phase 2. The purpose of Phase 2 was to dispatch technicians and engineers over a 3-year period to maintain and operate Voidjou (Vwadju) power plant on the island of Ngazidja (Grande Comore), the the Wemani power plant in city of Fomboni on the island of Mohéli (Mwali); and the Trenani power plant on the island of Ndzuani (Anjouan).
