The PBC carries the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The total cost of the Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Airport Expansion Project was $305 million and the borrower was expected to use the PBC (loan) proceeds to finance approximately 85% of the total project cost (and 85% of the total cost of a commercial contract with China Construction Eighth Engineering Division Co Ltd.). The loan’s outstanding amount as of June 30, 2018 was $181,959,183. Its outstanding amount as of June 30, 2021 was $103,976,676.

It also involved a 59,000 square meter expansion of the airport’s apron and the construction of a parking lot, cooling station, and emergency power generation unit.  Upon completion, it was envisaged that the new facility — with a total area of 57,000 square meters — would be able to accommodate 4.5 million passengers each year, thus doubling the baseline capacity of the airport.
