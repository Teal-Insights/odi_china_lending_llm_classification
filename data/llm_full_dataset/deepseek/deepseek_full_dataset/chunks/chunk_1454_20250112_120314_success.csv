86876,BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES,Dominica Agricultural Industrial and Development Bank borrows EC$2.786 million from China Eximbank to support on-lending activities,"In Fiscal Year 2008, Dominica Agricultural Industrial and Development Bank — a bank that is majority-owned by the Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica (GOCD) — borrowed EC$2,786,102  from China Eximbank to support on-lending activities. The loan was guaranteed by the GOCD","1. The 2008 annual report of the Dominica Agricultural Industrial and Development Bank identifies the ‘Republic of China’ as the lender. However, given that Dominica severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan in May 2004, the lender is almost certainly the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Reporting by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) corroborates the existence of a lending relationship between the PRC and Dominica Agricultural Industrial and Development Bank. 2. The precise financial commitment date is unknown. However, it is known that the EC$2,786,102  borrowing took place between July 1, 2007 and June 30, 2008. 3. For evidence that the lender is China Eximbank, see https://www.dropbox.com/s/jwlm7akcczpmbgr/New%20AID%20Bank%20Chairman%20outlines%20plans%20for%20the%20bank%20-%20GIS%20Dominica.pdf?dl=0 and https://www.dropbox.com/s/jntz051chitv5pp/Rationale%20-%20Dominica%20AID%20Bank%20June%204%2C%202013%282%29.pdf?dl=0. 4.
