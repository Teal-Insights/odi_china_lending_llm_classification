Then, on February 10, 2020, the RMB 18 billion (EGP 41 billion) currency swap agreement was renewed for another three years.  In early 2017, the CBE made a (gross) drawdown under the currency swap agreement equivalent RMB 18 billion. The PBOC credited RMB 18 billion to the CBE's account held with PBOC, and the CBE credited PBOC's account held with CBE with the EGP equivalent (49,249,800,000) of RMB 18 billion, based on the RMB-EGP exchange rate of 1:2.7361 at that time. The borrowing (drawdown) carried an estimated maturity of 1 year and an unknown interest rates (based on SHIBOR plus a margin). According to CBE, it made four additional (gross) drawdowns under the PBOC currency swap agreement: an RMB 18 billion drawdown in 2018, an RMB 18 billion drawdown in 2019, an RMB 18 billion drawdown in 2020, and an RMB 18 billion drawdown in 2021. These borrowings (drawdowns) also carried estimated maturities of 1 year and unknown interest rates (based on SHIBOR plus a margin).  The CBE’s 2017 drawdown is captured via Project ID#89406. Its 2018 drawdown is captured via Project ID#89408. Its 2019 drawdown is captured via Project ID#89410. Its 2020 drawdown is captured via Project ID#96200.  Its 2021 drawdown is captured via Project ID#96201. The (principal) amount outstanding under CBE’s PBOC swap facility was RMB 0 in 2016, RMB 18 billion in 2017, RMB 18 billion in 2018, RMB 18 billion in 2019, RMB 18 billion in 2020, and RMB 18 billion in 2021.","1. A bilateral currency swap (BCS) agreement — also known as a central bank liquidity swap agreement — is an agreement between the central banks of two countries to exchange cash flows in different currencies at predetermined rates over a specified period of time. Central banks participate in these agreements to facilitate bilateral trade settlements using their national currencies (rather than relying upon a third-party currency such as the U.S. dollar), manage demands from their local banks, and provide liquidity support to financial markets. The party that draws down on the swap line becomes the borrower and the other party becomes lender. During the term of the swap, the party that draws down on the swap line makes either fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amount. If both parties draw down on the swap line, then both parties exchange fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amounts. The 5-step process of drawing upon a currency swap line with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) can described from the perspective of an importer in a given country (‘Country X’) seeking to settle trade with a Chinese firm in RMB. Step 1: The central bank of Country X and the PBOC activate their currency swap in advance, at which point each party deposits a specific amount of its currency in an account controlled by the other party (i.e. the central bank of Country X deposits local currency in an account controlled by the PBOC, and the PBOC deposits an equivalent amount in RMB in an account controlled by the central bank of Country X). Step 2: A firm in Country X that imports goods from China applies for an RMB-denominated loan from a domestic bank. Step 3: The domestic bank in Country X that receives the loan application then applies to its central bank for an RMB-denominated loan. After a review process, the central bank of Country X notifies the domestic bank applicant that its loan application was approved. The central bank of Country X subsequently requests that the PBOC transfer RMB funds from the central bank of Country X’s swap account within the PBOC to the loan applicant’s account with a corresponding bank in China. Step 4: The domestic bank in Country X directs the corresponding bank in China to transfer RMB funds into a Chinese exporter’s account, and the corresponding bank in China provides RMB funds to the Chinese exporter. Step 5: The importer in Country X repays the RMB-denominated loan at its maturity date. The domestic bank notifies the central bank of Country X of the repayment, and transfers RMB into the central bank’s account within the PBOC through the corresponding bank in China. For the central bank of Country X, the RMB deposit is an asset that should be recorded on its balance sheet as an official reserve asset denominated in RMB. The contra entry of this asset is the liability in the local currency of Country X that represents China’s claims in the central bank of Country X. This should be also recorded on the balance sheet of the central bank of Country X. At the time of the exchange of currencies, it should be recorded as an increase in assets and an increase in liabilities of the monetary authorities in the balance of payments. The reason why the PBOC uses this mechanism to provide renminbi liquidity to other central bank is to increase the speed, convenience, and volume of transactions between the two countries. More detailed information about currency swaps with the PBOC can be found at https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021210-print-pdf.ashx and https://thechinaguys.com/the-rise-of-the-renminbi-the-reality-of-bilateral-swap-agreements/ and https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2017/pdf/17-25a.pdf.2. AidData treats drawdowns under BCS agreements with the PBOC as collateralized loans because, in a BCS arrangement, the currency of the borrower is held as collateral while the lender receives interest on the amount drawn down by the borrower until repayment is made.3. CBE’s currency swap with the PBOC is classified as ‘short term debt’ in the Government of Egypt’s 2020 bond prospectus and in various CBE reports. CBE defines short-term debt as debt ‘with [an] original maturity of up to one year,’ so AidData has coded the maturity length as 1 year for the time being. A paper prepared by the Central Bank of Egypt indicates the 'withdrawal and utilization' period to be up to one year in the currency swap (see https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2017/pdf/17-25a.pdf). However, the precise term (maturity length) of the swap agreement is unknown. This issue requires further investigation.4. The interest rate that applied to CBE’s RMB 18 billion drawdown is unknown, but it was very likely SHIBOR plus a margin (see https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021210-print-pdf.ashx). This issue requires further investigation.5. Most central banks publish their end-of-year outstanding PBOC swap debt, but only a few report detailed transaction-level data on drawdowns during the year. Therefore, if no information on drawings is available, AidData assumes that total drawdowns during the reporting period equal the amount outstanding at the end of the reporting period (and vice versa). Since the (de jure) maturities of PBOC swap drawings are 12 months or less, this creates a lower bound estimate for actual drawdowns under the PBOC swap line. 6. PBOC swap debt is frequently rolled over. In central bank reports where one can only observe the year-end outstanding amount, no distinction between rollovers and drawdowns is possible. In these cases, one can derive (new) drawdowns as the difference between the current and last year’s outstanding swap debt stock. This measure essentially captures net lending through the PBOC swap line.","# Sector

In the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI published in July 2020 and the Overseas Development Finance Dataset that Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center published in December 2020, China Eximbank is identified as the only lender that financed this project. However, multiple official sources identify this project as being financed by three Chinese banks — China Development Bank, Bank of China, and China Eximbank — through a syndicated loan. 4. This project achieved financial close on October 10, 2017. However, it is not clear how the agreement that was signed on October 10, 2017 is different from the agreement that was signed on May 15, 2017. This issue merits further investigation.5. At least one source (https://amritec.com/energy/) indicates that this project was financed according to an EPC+F model. This issue warrants further investigation. 6. The exact size of Bank of China and China Eximbank's respective financial contributions to the $459 million syndicated loan are unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes that both of the lending syndicate contributed equal amounts ($229,509,300).","# Sector

# Title
CDB contributes $231 million to syndicated buyer’s credit loan for EETC 500KV Transmission Lines Project (Linked to Project ID#53069 and #98763)

# Description
On January 21, 2016, the President of Egypt, Abdel Fattah El Sisi, and the President of China, Xi Jingping signed an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) in which the parties agreed to upgrade the capabilities of Egypt’s national 500kV backbone power grid. Then, on May 15, 2017, during a Belt and Road Forum in Beijing, the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC) signed a $690,018,600 syndicated buyer’s credit loan agreement with three Chinese state-owned banks — the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank), which served as the lead arranger, China Development Bank (CDB), and the Beijing Branch of Bank of China (BOC) — for the EETC 500KV Transmission Lines Project. China Development Bank contributed $231,000,000 to the loan syndicate (captured in Project ID#58351). China Eximbank and Bank of China contributed the remaining $459,018,600. AidData assumes that both members contributed equally ($229,509,300) (captured in Project ID#53069 and #98763). The loan carried a 15-year maturity. Its interest rate and grace period are unknown. Sinosure provided long-term buyer’s credit insurance to the borrower. Egypt’s Ministry of Finance also issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan in June 2017.  The proceeds of the syndicated loan were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the total cost ($811,790,000) of an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract that EETC signed with State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) on January 21, 2016. EETC assumed responsibility for the remaining 15% through an advance payment to SGCC. This project involved the construction of 1,210 km of high voltage (500 kV double-circuit AC) overhead transmission lines in the northern, central and southern parts of the Nile River Delta region. The lines were mainly distributed in areas near gas-fired power stations in the eastern part of the Nile River Delta region. The project was implemented in two phases and divided into 15 segments (or ‘lots’). It was envisaged that the project would increase the supply of reliable power to the Nile River Delta region, promote upstream and downstream industries in Egypt, and create 7,000 new jobs.    China Electric Power Equipment and Technology Co., Ltd. (CET) — a subsidiary of SGCC — was the general contractor responsible for the implementation. However, it hired several subcontractors, including China Energy Engineering Corporation (CEEC), Hubei Engineering Co., Ltd., and Power Construction Corporation of China (PowerChina). It also hired Jiangsu Zhongtian Technologies Software Technology Co., Ltd, a private Chinese company, for all line equipment and electric metal fittings. The project officially commenced on May 6, 2016. Then, on November 3, 2016, 3 transmission lines with a total length of 380 km (part of Phase 1) were successfully put into operation. In May 2017, the construction of an additional transmission line was completed.  On September 4, 2017, an agreement on Phase 2 was signed during the BRICS summit.    The same month witnessed the completion of a 94 km section that began in April 2016 and was undertaken by Hubei Engineering Co., Ltd.  By the end of 2017, the borrower had drawn $115,000,000 from CDB’s contribution to the syndicated loan. However, the size of the borrower’s drawdowns from the Bank of China’s contribution and China Eximbank’s contribution are unknown.  Another 80 km segment was completed on November 26, 2018. Two additional transmission lines — an 80 km line from Samanoud to Banha and a 94 km line from Borosus to Samanoud — were completed by Hubei Engineering Co., Ltd. in January 2019. As of mid-2019, the project had achieved a 96% completion rate.    By the end of June 2019, another 194 km of lines were constructed and the project reached full completion.",TRUE,NA,GREY,HIGH,Grid Infrastructure,"Primary purpose is transmission infrastructure development, which enables both renewable and non-renewable power distribution","Construction of 1,210 km of high voltage (500 kV double-circuit AC) overhead transmission lines, mainly distributed near gas-fired power stations in the Nile River Delta region"
