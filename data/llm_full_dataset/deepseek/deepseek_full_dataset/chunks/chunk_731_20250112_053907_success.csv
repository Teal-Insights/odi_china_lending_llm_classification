The loan included an annual interest rate of 1.3% plus 3-month LIBOR and was governed by the law of Macau. The average 3-month LIBOR rate in October 2017 was 1.361%. Therefore, the interest rate was coded as 1.361+1.3=2.661%.

The CCBC Loan was expected to be drawn down shortly after its signing and was to be used for working capital and to fund the restoration of production of the Pakrut gold mine.  LLC Pakrut, a mine that is 100% owned by Kryso Resources Ltd, was first established in 2003 and it operates the Pakrut deposit located on the southern slope of the Gissar range, 107 km from the city of Dushanbe.
