# Description
In 2011, the Chinese Government provided a $1.7 million loan to Société Nationale de Chemin de Fer du Congo (SNCC) — a state-owned railway company in the DRC — for “non-technical elements”. This project is one of seven projects that SNCC financed through a $200 million credit line from the Chinese Government (see Project ID#58762). It is identified in the 2011 Annual Report of Cellule d'Exécution de Transport Multimodal de la République Démocratique du Congo (CEPTM). The implementation status of this project is unknown. According to a 2010 World Bank Report, the 200 million line of credit was intended to support the SNCC recovery plan, and will enable SNCC to acquire new rolling stock and railway track construction materials, as well as acquire 2 electrical substations. The same report stated that the 200 million USD was provided by China to the government of DRC, who then transferred the financing to SNCC in the form of a grant.  On September 17, 2007, the Congolese Minister for Public Works & Infrastructure Pierre Lumbi and Chinese Ambassador to the DRC Wu Xexuan signed a railway project agreement. The agreement envisaged (a) the construction of a 700 km new line between the river port of Ilebo and Kinshasa, and (b) rehabilitation of the 1,067 mm gauge lines linking Sakania and Lubumbashi in the province of Katanga to Ilebo and from Kinshasa to Matadi. It is unclear if the proceeds from this $1.7 million loan to SNCC in 2011 were used to facilitate the implementation of the same railway project.",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,MEDIUM,General Infrastructure,Project focuses on non-technical elements of railway infrastructure without clear environmental or energy transition impacts,"Loan for non-technical elements, railway infrastructure focus, no specific energy or environmental components mentioned"
