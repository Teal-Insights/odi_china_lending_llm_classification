Then, on December 12, 2011, China Eximbank and the Government of Lesotho signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 200 million to support Phase 2 of the National Telecom Network Project. The borrowing terms of the GCL are unknown.   The Government of Lesotho used the proceeds of the loan to on-lend to Econet Telecom Lesotho, a state-owned telecommunications operator in Lesotho.

This project is also known as the Econet Telecom Lesotho (ETL) National Network Phase II Project.  The Chinese project title is 莱索托全国通讯网络二期项目 or 莱索托国家电信网络项目二期. 2. Government concessional loans from China Eximbank are denominated in RMB, so AidData relies on the face value of the loan (RMB 200 million) reported by the IMF. In the the database of Chinese loan commitments that it released in July 2020, SAIS-CARI refers to the face value of the loan as $9 million, which is substantially lower than the values reported by the IMF (RMB 200 million), the World Bank ($36 million), the Government of Lesotho ($20 million), and the Public Accounts Committee (M245,297,692.05). 3. SAIS-CARI also identifies this project as reaching the loan signature (i.e. official commitment) stage but not the implementation stage or completion stage. However, AidData records this project as completed based on the May 31, 2013 handover date reported by the Chinese Government.4.
