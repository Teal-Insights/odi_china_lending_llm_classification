The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance a September 22, 2012 commercial contract [ID#EXMB/KG/0BI-03] worth $129,825,916.30 between the Kyrgyz Ministry of Transport and Communications and China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC).   According to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the first loan disbursement (of $32,456,479) took place on September 30, 2013 and the second loan disbursement (of $32,456,500) took place on December 31, 2014. The same source notes that, as of 2015, the loan disbursement rate was 50% ($64,912,979 out of $129,825,916). According to internal data that the Kyrgyz Ministry of Finance shared with AidData in July 2022, this loan achieved a disbursement rate of 100% as of December 31, 2021 and its amount outstanding was $131,147,402.32 as of December 31, 2021.  The project sought to rehabilitate the Osh-Batken-lsfana road (specifically, a road section from 220km to 232 km and a road section from 248 km to 360 km) and the Bishkek-Balykchi road (specifically, a road section from 147 km to 172 km).   CRBC was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began in July 2013. The Bishkek-Balykchy road segment was completed on July 22, 2015. The 127 km Osh-Batken-Isfana road section was completed on November 10, 2016. The section from kilometer 271 to kilometer 360 was completed in October 2018.  However, there are some indications that the preferential buyer's credit for the Two Sections of Highway Rehabilitation Project (Osh-Batken-Isfana 127 km Section and Bishkek-Balykchy 25 km Section) financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic signed a debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE2-029]. Under the terms of the agreement (captured via Project ID#96102), the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 under the preferential buyer's credit agreement for the Two Sections of Highway Rehabilitation Project (Osh-Batken-Isfana 127 km Section and Bishkek-Balykchy 25 km Section).",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,General Infrastructure,Project focuses on highway rehabilitation without clear environmental or energy transition impacts,"Rehabilitation of Osh-Batken-Isfana and Bishkek-Balykchy road sections, no mention of environmental or energy-related components"
