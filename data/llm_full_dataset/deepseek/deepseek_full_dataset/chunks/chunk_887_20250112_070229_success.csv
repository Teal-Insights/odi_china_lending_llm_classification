63673,EDUCATION,Chinese Government provides NZ $14.58 million grant for Apii Nikao School Construction Project,"After the destruction of part of Avatea Primary School in 2014 in an arson attack, it was decided to merge Avatea with nearby Nikao Maori School into one school called Apii Nikao. The Apii Nikao School Rebuild Committee approved the demolition of Avatea and Nikao Maori schools in late 2014. Its decision then was based on indications from Chinese officials that the Chinese Government was supportive of the school rebuild project and eager to assist the Cook Islands with constructing the Apii Nikao school for the country’s August 50th anniversary celebrations.   On April 22, 2015, a project design scheme, created by China Urban Construction Design & Research Institute, was approved. Then, on October 27, 2015, the Chinese Government and the Government of the Cook Islands signed letters of exchange, which committed NZ $14.58 million of grant funding for the Apii Nikao School Construction Project. ON June 22, 2016, a project implementation agreement was signed. China Civil Engineering Construction (CCECC) was the contractor responsible for the construction of the school. It was awarded a construction contract in April 2017 and its work was supervised by China Railway Fifth Survey and Design Institute Group Co. Ltd. CCECC hired Landholding Ltd (a local contractor) to construct the timber block fence surrounding the school and Prestige Furnishings Ltd (another local contractor) to supply storage units for teachers.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 5,200 square meter school with the capacity to accommodate 500 students and 40 staff in Rarotonga. Cook Islands Prime Minister Henry Puna said the project has been an “opportunity” for local input to design an environmentally sustainable school. China Urban Construction Design collaborated closely with the school, the Cook Islands Investment Corporation, and the Ministry of Education to prepare detailed designs. These were then reviewed by the Cook Islands Government and local engineers.   The project involved the construction of three classroom blocks covering approximately 5,200vm2. The buildings feature flexible learning spaces, including large learning areas for each grade and break-out spaces for individual or smaller group learning. These flexible spaces support innovative learning principles promoted in New Zealand schools. Apii Nikao introduced the innovative learning system when Nikao Maori and Avatea schools merged in early 2015. Water tanks, solar panels for power generation, and a pillared-concrete fencing system were also installed to make the school more resilient to climate change and to reduce its carbon footprint.  A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on May 12, 2017. However, construction did not begin until May 23, 2017.

This project involves the construction of 946 kilometers of 225kV power transmission lines and 736 kilometers of 90kV power transmission lines, the installation of 13 new transformers, and the rehabilitation of 14 old transformers. More specifically, the project involves the construction of a 225 kV, 162 km transmission line that runs from Sérébou to Bondoukou, the construction of a 90 kV, 138 km transmission line that runs from Agnibilékro to Bondoukou via Tanda, the construction of a 90 kV, 170 km transmission line that runs from Bondoukou to Bouna, the construction of a 90 kV, 231 km transmission line that runs from Bouna to Kong, the construction of a 90 kV, 93.1 km transmission line that runs from Kong to Ferké, the construction of a 90 kV, 58 km transmission line that runs from Attakro to Daoukro, the construction of a 90 kV, 170 km transmission line that runs from Bouake 2 to Daoukro, the construction of a 90 kV, 57 km transmission line that runs from Daloa to Vavoua, the construction of a 90 kV, 54 km transmission line that runs from Zuénoula to Vavoua, the construction of a 90 kV, 66 km transmission line that runs from Seguela to Mankono, and the the construction of a 90 kV, 79 km transmission line that runs from Zuénoula to Mankono, the expansion of the Agnibilékro substation, the construction of 90kV substations at Tanda, Bouna, Vavoua, Mankono and Daoukro the construction of 225/90kV substations at Sérébou and Bondoukou, the construction of a 90/33kV substation at Kong, the doubling of a transmission line at the 225 kV Kossoubouake substation. The project will take place in four zones: Zone 1 in the North-east, Zone 2 in the Center-North, Zone 3 in the Center-West and Zone 4 in the West. The ultimate objective of the project is to provide electricity to 500 villages along the transmission lines.  China National Electric Engineering Co. (CNEEC) and China National Machinery Industry Corporation (SINOMACH) are the EPC contractors responsible for implementation. China Railway 25th Bureau and CMEC were also involved in implementation (most likely as subcontractors). The project is overseen by Société des Energies de Côte d’Ivoire (CI-ENERGIES), a state-owned asset holding company that is responsible for managing assets in the electricity sector. Project implementation commenced on December 28, 2016. However, a formal groundbreaking ceremony did not take place until July 7, 2018. The project was scheduled to take place over 43 months and end in July 2020. However, it was officially completed in May 2021.",TRUE,NA,GREY,HIGH,Grid Infrastructure,"Primary purpose is grid infrastructure development, which supports both renewable and non-renewable energy distribution","Construction of 946 km of 225kV and 736 km of 90kV power transmission lines, installation of transformers, and expansion of substations"
