34789,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides $34.53 million buyer’s credit loan for 220kV Cambambe-Luanda Electricity Transmission Line Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#42029),"On November 28, 2003, the Chinese Government and the Angolan Government signed a framework agreement pertaining to a special economic cooperation arrangement (Agreement name in Chinese: 中华人民共和国商务部与安哥拉共和国财政部关于两国经贸合作特殊安排的框架协议).  Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility,  carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections. The process was managed by an office in the Angolan Ministry of Finance -- known as Gabinete de Apoio Técnico (GAT) -- that was specifically created to manage the MLFA with China Eximbank.  In March 2005, China Eximbank and the Government of Angola signed a $34,530,930.90 subsidiary buyer’s credit loan agreement under the MLFA for the 220kV Cambambe-Luanda Electricity Transmission Line Construction Project.  The proceeds of the loan were used to partially finance a $38,367,701.00 commercial (EPC) contract with China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC), which was signed on March 9, 2005.  The purpose of the project, which employed 60 Angolan workers and 120 Chinese workers, was to construct a 220kV electricity transmission line from Cambambe to Luanda.  CMEC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. The EPC contract for this project was originally scheduled to go into effect on November 8, 2005, and its originally scheduled handover date was September 2007.  The project was ultimately completed and put into operation on December 5, 2007.","1.

The proceeds of this loan were used to partially finance a $48,060,432.43 commercial contract between Sinohydro and Angola's Ministry of Health, which was signed on October 25, 2005.   The purpose of this project, which employed 127 Angolan workers and 168 Chinese workers, was the construction and equipping of a regional hospital (with two buildings, one with seven floors and another with two floors) in the city of Lubango (known as António Agostinho Neto Hospital, Hospital Dr. Agostinho Neto, and Hospital Universitário do Lubango).  Upon completion, it was expected that the hospital would benefit over three million inhabitants of Huíla province and others from the neighbouring provinces, namely Namibe, Cunene, Kuando Kubango, Benguela and Huambo.

On November 28, 2003, the Chinese Government and the Angolan Government signed a framework agreement pertaining to a special economic cooperation arrangement (Agreement name in Chinese: 中华人民共和国商务部与安哥拉共和国财政部关于两国经贸合作特殊安排的框架协议).  Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility,  carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections. The process was managed by an office in the Angolan Ministry of Finance -- known as Gabinete de Apoio Técnico (GAT) -- that was specifically created to manage the MLFA with China Eximbank.  In October 2005, China Eximbank and the Government of Angola signed a $16,674,955.20 subsidiary buyer’s credit loan agreement under the MLFA for the Kwanza-Norte and Kwanza-Sul Municipal Hospital Construction and Equipping Project.  The proceeds of the loan were used to partially finance a $18,527,728.00 commercial (EPC) contract with CAMCO, which was signed on October 29, 2005.  The purpose of the project, which employed 25 Angolan workers and 25 Chinese workers, was to construct and equip two municipal hospitals in Cazengo within Kwanza-Norte Province and Sumbe within Kwanza-Sul Province.  CAMCO was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. The EPC contract for the project began in two phases on November 1, 2006 and November 17, 2006.  The originally expected handover dates for the two phases of the project were February 1, 2008, and February 17, 2008, respectively. The project was reportedly completed, but its precise implementation start and end dates are unknown.  This project received additional financing through another China Eximbank $500 million MLFA in September 2007 (see Project ID#34831 and ID#34030).",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,Healthcare and Education Facilities,"Project focuses on hospital construction and equipping, with no direct environmental or energy transition impacts","Construction and equipping of two municipal hospitals, healthcare sector project"
