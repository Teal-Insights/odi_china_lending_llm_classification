Then, on March 18, 2010, the Chinese Government and the Government of Fiji signed a preferential loan framework agreement on Low-Cost and Public Rental Housing Projects.   On July 28, 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Fiji’s Ministry of Economy signed an RMB 36,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Raiwai Public Rental Housing Project.The  GCL, which is captured via Project ID#62719, carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The Government of Fiji’s Ministry of Economy then on-lent the proceeds of the GCL to the Public Rental Board (PRB), a state-owned enterprise, and the PRB in turn used the proceeds of the GCL to finance a commercial contract that it signed with China Railway First Group (Fiji) Company Ltd in 2010.   According to a 2016 Audit Report, Fiji’s Cabinet resolved on February 1, 2011 that the Public Rental Board (PRB) would be responsible for reimbursing (repaying) the Fiji Government for all debt-related costs and fees associated with the GCL. However, the 2016 Audit Report also found that the loan receivable was not recorded in the Lending Register or the FMIS general ledger for the past five years (2011-2015). PRB commenced loan repayment in March 2016.  The purpose of the project was to construct 210 housing units (one and two-bedroom flats) in the Raiwaqa and Raiwai neighborhoods within the city of Suva. It was implemented in two phases. Phase 1 involved the construction of 82 housing units and Phase 2 involved the construction of 128 housing units. China Railway First Group (Fiji) Company Ltd was the contractor responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on August 12, 2011. However, in January 2013, the Suva City Council has issued a stop work order to China Railway First Group (Fiji) Company Ltd.   According to the Chairman of the Housing Authority and Public Rental Board, Colonel Mosese Tikoitoga, the stop work order followed a prolonged dispute between China Railway First Group (Fiji) Company Ltd and the Public Rental Board over building code issues. China Railway First Group — the parent company of China Railway First Group (Fiji) Company Ltd. — argued that the commercial contract it signed with the Public Rental Board allowed the structural design of the buildings to be of Chinese national standards. Colonel Mosese Tikoitoga said a meeting between all the parties including the Ministry of Local Government would be convened so that an amicable solution is reached. He also said that the Public Rental Board had taken its grievances to the Suva City Council, which resulted in the issuance of the stop work order.    The dispute over building standards also led to a significant cost escalation and a disagreement between the parties regarding the cost of the underlying commercial contract. The dispute was referred to Fiji’s Dispute Adjudication Board (DAB), which is an independent body. However, it reportedly took a plea by Prime Minister Bainimarama during a visit to Beijing, and the Chinese Embassy stepping in with FJD 9.3 million of grant funding (captured via Project ID#85704), to resolve the dispute. Phase 1 was completed on or around May 13, 2014. Phase 2 was originally slated for completion in August 2014. However, it was ultimately completed on August 31, 2018.","1.

On July 28, 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Fiji’s Ministry of Economy signed a separate government concessional loan agreement for the Public Low-Cost Housing Project, which was then on-lent to the Housing Authority and not the Public Rental Board (as captured via Project ID#62721).3.

This loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. In 2013, the Government of Gabon and China Eximbank also signed a USD-denominated preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the Port Gentil-Omboué Road and Ogooué River Booué Bridge Construction Project.  The face value of the PBC was approximately 254.4 billion CFA francs, or approximately $534,582,600. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. The proceeds from the GCL and the PBC were used to finance a $663 million EPC contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC). Approximately 95% of the cost of this project was financed by China Eximbank while the remaining 5% was financed by the Government of Gabon itself.  The GCL that supported this project is captured in Project ID#60747. The PBC that supported this project is captured in Project ID#73174.   The project involved the construction of a 93.26 km two-way, two-lane highway from Port Gentil to Omboué (with an asphalt concrete surface, a subgrade width of 12 meters, and a subgrade width of 10 meters), the construction of three bridges (the 4707 meter Ogooué River Bridge, the 367 meter Booué Bridge, and the 4577 meter Nkomi Laguna Bridge) measuring 13 km in length, and the construction of 141 culverts.   CRBC was the contractor responsible for project implementation. It received an order to commence construction on March 20, 2014. Then, a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 3, 2014. The project was handed over on December 23, 2020.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loans for the Port Gentil-Omboue Road and Bridge Construction Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In mid-2014, a decline in international oil prices generated sharp reductions in Gabon’s oil exports and fiscal revenues. The country’s rising fiscal deficit led to the accumulation of arrears to external creditors. By 2017, the stock of the Government of Gabon’s external arrears stood at $115 million, including arrears to China, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Israel, and South Korea. All of these arrears were successfully cleared by 2020. However, the Government of Gabon accumulated $3 million of additional arrears to Chinese creditors in 2020.  By the end of May 2021, ‘the stock of [the Government of] Gabon’s external arrears stood at CFAF 98.03 billion (US$182.1 million), including CFAF 23.8 billion (US$44.2 million) vis-à-vis multilaterals and CFAF 21.05 billion (US$39.1 million) vis-à-vis government agencies and private creditors insured with companies from Paris Club member countries and from China [ICBC and China Construction Bank] CFAF 1.3 billion (US$2.42 million). The Government's strategy for the clearance of existing external arrears consists of focusing primarily on multilateral debt, bilateral debt, insured commercial commitments and seeking agreements with other creditors prior to the IMF Board meeting. Accordingly, we will clear the arrears vis-à-vis the multilaterals. We will also clear bilateral and commercial-insured arrears as follows: (i) Austria CFAF 6.83 billion (US$12.69 million); (ii) France CFAF 11.9 billion (US$22.11 million); (iii) Israel CFAF 2.23 billion (US$4.13 million); and Spain CFAF 0.09 billion (US$0.17 million).

The same communication was made with China to which our bilateral payment arrears are about CFAF 34.01 billion (US$63.17 million).’ Then, in 2022, the IMF reported that the Government of Gabon’s external arrears to Chinese creditors stood at $23.9 million as of December 2021 and $1 million in June 2022.","1.

We will also clear bilateral and commercial-insured arrears as follows: (i) Austria CFAF 6.83 billion (US$12.69 million); (ii) France CFAF 11.9 billion (US$22.11 million); (iii) Israel CFAF 2.23 billion (US$4.13 million); and Spain CFAF 0.09 billion (US$0.17 million). Regarding the other commercial arrears vis-à-cis AFREXIMBANK (CFAF 7.52 billion or US$13.97 million, and commercial non-insured vis-à-vis France CFAF 0.7 billion (US$1.24 million), Austria CFAF 8.71 billion (US$16.18 million), and Morocco CFAF 1.01 billion (US$1.87 million), we contacted these creditors individually to obtain from them the non-objection agreement. The same communication was made with China to which our bilateral payment arrears are about CFAF 34.01 billion (US$63.17 million).’ Then, in 2022, the IMF reported that the Government of Gabon’s external arrears to Chinese creditors stood at $23.9 million as of December 2021 and $1 million in June 2022.",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,General Infrastructure,"Project involves construction of roads and bridges, which is general infrastructure without clear environmental or energy transition impacts","Construction of 93.26 km highway, three bridges, and 141 culverts; no mention of energy or environmental components"

30956,COMMUNICATIONS,China Eximbank provides $123.4 million preferential buyer’s credit for Phase 2 of Dedicated Security Information System Project (Linked to Project ID#1862),"On October 28, 2013, the Government of Ghana signed a $123,409,273.10 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2013) 06 TOTAL NO. (25)] with China Eximbank for Phase 2 of Dedicated Security Information System Project. The Ghanaian Parliament ratified the PBC agreement on November 12, 2013. The PBC (loan) carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 1% management fee, and a 0.75% commitment fee. The PBC proceeds were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $129,904,498.00 commercial (supply) contract, which was signed by the Government of the Republic of Ghana’s National Security Council and ZTE Corporation on October 28, 2011 and subsequently amended by the Republic of Ghana’s Ministry of Communications and ZTE Corporation on October 15, 2013.    According to the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $123,409,273.10 loan (PBC) achieved a 100% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 5 loan disbursements (worth $123,409,273.10) between 2014 and 2017: a $32,476,124.50 disbursement on December 31, 2014, a $31,605,686.71 disbursement on June 30, 2015, a $10,439,766.75 disbursement on June 30, 2016, a $35,897,245.34 disbursement on June 30, 2017, and a $12,990,449.80 disbursement on February 28, 2017.  The loan’s (principal) amount outstanding was GHS 637,210,000 ($113,787,500) as of December 31, 2020 and GHS 617,000,000 ($118,653,846) as of December 31, 2021.  The purpose of the Dedicated Security Information System Project was to strengthen the country's security and emergency aid services — including Immigration, Prisons, Fire Service, Customs, Ghana Armed Forces, Police Service, the Ministry of Defense, and the Ministry of National Security — through the establishment of a national security information system. Phase 1 covered the main cities, towns, border entries and exits, and main traffic arteries in six regions of southern Ghana, including Greater Accra Region, Ashanti Region, Central Region, Eastern Region, Volta Region and Western Region. It was financed through a $30 million China Eximbank loan that was approved in 2007 (captured via Project ID#1862).    With support from ZTE, Phase 2 extended the national security information system to the country’s Upper East Region, Upper West Region, Brong Ahafo Region, and Northern Region. Huawei was also involved in the implementation of Phase 2. Specifically, it helped the Government of Ghana to equip a Ghana Police Command Centre (or Ghana National Security Emergency Command Center), with CCTV cameras and digital (eLTE 4) trunking network to respond more expeditiously to issues such as robbery, vehicular accidents, murder, and fire emergencies across all regions of the country. To this end, Huawei installed a 1.4 GHz eLTE network and 253 eLTE base stations to cover major cities and roads — the first system of its kind outside of China. Huawei also provided handheld terminals, vehicle-mounted stations, Emergency Communications Vehicles (ECVs), and fixed-access terminals and accessories to meet the requirements of both fixed and mobile situations. Today, the Ghana public security department reports emergencies through trunking handsets that can send on-site videos to the command center in real time. Then, the command center immediately invokes the wired and wireless cameras on-site and dispatches police cars equipped with eLTE stations for support. ECVs are used by the Ghana government guard. When the president travels, personnel in the mobile emergency command network watch over the presidential motorcade and communicate with the command center in real time via satellite transmission. Huawei also provided a unified solution that integrates eLTE, emergency communications centers, intelligent video surveillance, and telepresence video conferencing. As such, the Ghana Police Station can now establish voice and video communication with the Presidential Palace, and medical, fire fighting, and other government departments for faster and better-coordinated responses.   The Ghana Police Command Centre (or Ghana National Security Emergency Command Center) was officially inaugurated on December 15, 2017. However, the Gh-DCMIS identifies the official project completion date as June 30, 2017. The originally expected project implementation start and end dates were October 28, 2013 and December 30, 2016, respectively.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 2 of the Dedicated Security Information System Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the World Bank’s International Development Statistics, the Government of Ghana had accumulated principal and interest arrears to one or more official sector Chinese creditors worth $908,337,346.70) in 2020 ($763,228,526.60 in principal arrears and $145,108,820.10 in interest arrears).
