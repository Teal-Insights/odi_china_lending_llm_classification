47008,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides RMB 867.2 million government concessional loan for 54.66 MW Garissa Solar Power Plant Construction Project,"On August 31, 2015, China Eximbank and the Government of Kenya signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL No. 2015 (10)] worth RMB 867,293,233.33 ($135,784,014) for the Garissa Solar Power Plant Construction Project. The GCL carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 10.25 year grace period, and a 20 year maturity. The loan is scheduled for repayment in semi-annual installments between December 31, 2025 and September 21, 2035.   The loan had achieved a disbursement rate of 93.47% ($126,922,733 out of $135,784,014) and there was an undrawn balance of $8,861,281 (worth 6.52% of the face value of the loan) as of June 30, 2021. The borrower made principal repayments worth RMB 47,502,088.34 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and no principal repayments between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022).

The purpose of the $151,047,789.51 project was to construct a solar power plant that is located 20 kilometers north of Garissa, in Barki Village. The power plant was originally planned to have a capacity of 50 MW, providing electricity for 350,000 people and 1000 employment opportunities for citizens in the area.   Jiangxi Corporation for International Economic and Technical Cooperation (CJIC) was the general contractor responsible for project implementation, but it undertook the project in collaboration with Kenya's Rural Electrification Authority (REA) and the Chinese solar company JinkoSolar. Project implementation commenced on September 29, 2016. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta officially launched the power plant on December 13, 2019. When solar panel prices went down, the capacity of the plant was increased from 50MW to 54.66MW. Of the power produced by the plant, Garissa town consumes roughly 5MW and the rest is connected to the national grid, making it the biggest solar plant in East Africa. The plant sits on 85 acres and consists of 210,000 photovoltaic (PV) panels. The power plant is now operated by Kenya's Rural Electrification Authority (REA) and it sells power to Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC).","1. This project is also known as the Development of Solar Power Project in Garissa. The Chinese project title is 加里萨50MW光伏电站项目. 2. One source claims that the plant was commissioned as early as September 24, 2018. Another source also claims that the plant can service up to 625,000 homes. 3. The loan identification number in the National Treasury’s public debt register is 2015012 (or 2015012_1). 4. Given that this loan was issued as a GCL, it was almost certainly denominated in RMB.

The BCL carries the following borrowing terms: a 20.5 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3% margin, a 0.5% ($6,989,636.87) management fee, a 0.5% commitment fee, and a 1% default interest rate. It is scheduled for 30 semi-annual repayments between January 21, 2021 and July 21, 2036. The loan is backed by a credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure). The total cost of the Sinosure insurance premium is $161,875,409.70.   The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan (BCL) to finance (a) 85% ($1,260,333,275.02) of the total cost of a $1,482,745,029.40 commercial contract between Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) and China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), which was signed on September 19, 2015; and (b) 85% of the total cost ($137,594,098.25 out of $161,875,409.70) of the medium-long term buyer’s credit insurance premium from Sinosure. The remaining 15% ($222,411,754.41) of the $1,482,745,029.40 commercial contract cost was to be paid by Kenya Railways Corporation to China Road and Bridge Corporation as counterpart financing. The National Treasury of the Republic of Kenya on-lent the proceeds of the BCL to the project’s ‘end-user’ (Kenya Railways Corporation).   The loan is also secured by (i.e. collateralized against) project revenues from the Railway Development Fund (RDF), which are deposited in an escrow account.  According to the audited financial statements of Kenya Railways Corporation, the cash balances in the escrow account (Account No. 1203286473) were as follows: KES 239,914,450 (USD 2,327,170.16) in June 2017, KES 241,215,828 (USD 2,388,036.69) in June 2018, KES 2,816,826,324 (USD 27,604,897.97) in June 2019, and KES 2,853,104,749 (USD 26,819,184.64) in June 2020.

The purpose of the railway extension project was to construct a 120 km railway — including a 5.3 kilometer tunnel to be built in Great Rift Valley and a 6.5 viaduct across Nairobi National Park — that would link special industrial zones in Naivasha (home to the Olkaria geothermal power plants) to Nairobi and Mombasa. The 120 km stretch of railway starts from the west end of the Nairobi South Hub (end point of the Mombasa – Nairobi SGR); then it turns south-westwards through the Nairobi National Park and west past Twala and Ongata Rongai Towns; then it crosses Magadi Road next to the Adventists University and Ngong Road at Embulbul; then it descends into Rift Valley through a tunnel located North-West of Ngong Hills; then it proceeds North-West to the proposed Industrial Parks at Mai Mahiu and Suswa; then it crosses B3 at Duka Moja.    China Communications Construction Company and China Bridge and Road Corporation (CRBC) were the contractors responsible for project implementation. This project was formally launched by the President of Kenya on October 19, 2016 (through a foundation stone-laying ceremony). Construction was originally expected to be complete by June 2019. Construction ultimately commenced on January 12, 2018 and reached completion on September 19, 2019. The railway line from Nairobi to Naivasha was opened to traffic on October 16, 2019.

(2015) 9 TOTAL NO. 548] for the Aral-Kazarman Section (195 km-291 km) of the Alternative North-South Road Project. The GCL (loan) carried the following borrowing terms: a 25 year maturity, an 11 year grace period, a 1.5% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.18% management fee, and a 0.18% commitment fee. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a May 4, 2014 commercial contract [EXMB/KG/NS-05] worth $298,796,966.13 between the Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic and China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC).   According to internal data that the Kyrgyz Ministry of Finance shared with AidData in July 2022, this loan achieved a disbursement rate of 100% as of December 31, 2021 and its amount outstanding was $702,910,588.76 as of December 31, 2021.    The purpose of the project was to construct a section of the Alternative North-South Road that runs from Aral to Kazarman (195 km to 291 km). The ultimate aim of this international North-South transport corridor is to reduce trade costs and connect Russia, Central Asia, Iran, and India.   CRBC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on August 10, 2015 and the project was originally scheduled for completion in December 2018. However, as of December 2020, it had still only achieved a 70% completion rate. The project was ultimately completed on November 10, 2021. It passed China Eximbank's final inspection in November 2022.  There are some indications that the government concessional loan for the Aral-Kazarman Section (195 km-291 km) of the Alternative North-South Road Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic signed a debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE2-029]. Under the terms of the agreement (captured via Project ID#96102), the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 under the government concessional loan for the Aral-Kazarman Section (195 km-291 km) of the Alternative North-South Road Project.  The Alternative North-South Road project has also been plagued by controversy and corruption allegations. According to a 2018 investigation, former Minister of Transport and Communications Kalykbek Sultanov and the Minister of Transport and Communications at the time (Zhamshitbek Kalilov) may have colluded with the contractor responsible for project implementation (CRBC) to embezzle funds that were allocated for the Alternative North-South Road by China Eximbank. The investigation found the project input costs were inflated by several orders of magnitude — from paying $1.1 per kilogram of cement (while the cost on the local market was $0.07) to paying $2,000 a month to provide office space to an engineer on the construction site.","1.
