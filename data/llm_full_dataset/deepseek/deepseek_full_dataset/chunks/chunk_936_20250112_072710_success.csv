54287,ENERGY,"[CPEC, IPP] China Eximbank contributes to $62.6 million syndicated loan for 100 MW Solar PV Power Plant in Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park (Linked to Project ID #50939, #53985, #92501, #92503)","On October 16, 2015, Apollo Solar Development Pakistan Limited (ASDPL) — a project company (special purpose vehicle) established by Zonergy Company Limited, itself a subsidiary of ZTE Corporation — signed two different syndicated loan agreements with China Eximbank and China Development Bank (CDB) for the 100 MW Solar PV Power Plant in Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park. The first is an RMB 400 million syndicated loan agreement with a 2.65% interest rate and a 10-year maturity. China Eximbank's contribution to the RMB-denominated facility is captured in Project ID#53985 and CDB's contribution to the RMB-denominated facility is captured in Project ID#92503. The second is a $62.6 million syndicated loan agreement with an interest rate of 4.96% (LIBOR plus 4.2%) and a 10-year maturity.   China Eximbank's contribution to the USD-denominated facility is captured in Project ID#54287 and CDB's contribution to the USD-denominated facility is captured in Project ID#92501. The borrower purchased credit insurance from Sinosure for both of these syndicated loans. The borrower, ASDPL, was expected to use the loan proceeds to partially finance two commercial (EPC) contracts that it signed on on June 27, 2015: an RMB 863.316 million offshore supply contract that it signed with China First Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd. and an RMB 135.683 million onshore construction contract with MCC Ruba International Construction Company (Pvt) Ltd. The total project cost was $149.154 million and it was financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 79:21. ASDPL achieved financial close on November 6, 2015, which is typically the date of the first loan disbursement.   The project was implemented on a build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) basis and it involved the construction of a 100 MW solar PV power plant located at Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park at Lal Sohanra in Cholistan within Bahawalpur District of the Province of Punjab. China First Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd and MCC Ruba International Construction Company (Pvt) Ltd were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. This project reached its commercial operations date (COD) on May 31, 2016.   However, this project has encountered debt repayment and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. In May 2022, reports emerged that the Government of Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to Zonergy and its subsidiaries/SPVs. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 10.4 billion (approximately $52 million). Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this “[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).","1. The project implementation start date is unknown. For the time being, AidData relies on the financial closure date as a proxy for the project implementation start date, since this is typically the date of the first loan disbursement. 2. According to multiple, official sources, the Government of Pakistan has issued sovereign guarantees in support of all loans issued by Chinese state-owned banks for independent power projects (IPPs) in Pakistan (see https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cepk/chn/zbgx/t1735166.htm and http://pk.chineseembassy.org/eng/zbgx/202110/t20211010_9558510.htm and https://www.dropbox.com/s/bmx3w2b38o7guxm/Debt%20Pricing%20of%20IPPs%20%28002%29.pdf?dl=0). As such, AidData assumes that the loan captured in this record is backed by a sovereign guarantee from the Government of Pakistan. 3. The individual contributions of China Eximbank and CDB to the $62.6 million syndicated loan are unknown. For the time being, AidData estimates that each of the two Chinese state-owned banks contributed equal amounts ($31.3 million). 4. On November 8, 2014, the Chinese Government and the Government of Pakistan signed a CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement. According to Article 5 of the Agreement, ‘the Pakistani Party agrees that a revolving account shall be opened with 30 days of commercial operation of the respective project, into which the money, no less than the 22 per cent of the monthly payments for the respective power project under the agreement shall be deposited to provide cover for the shortfall in power bill recoveries from the date of power generation of the said projects agreements subject to the condition that the additional direct and indirect expenses incurred in maintaining the revolving account would be compensated by the producers through a discount arrangement to be mutually agreed.’ Subsequently, the Finance Division, in consultation with the Power Division, finalized a mechanism for the Revolving Account (RA) with the approval of The Minister of Finance in a letter dated June 22, 2015. Then, in September 2017, the Power Division forwarded a draft Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) to be signed between Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guaranteed (CPPA-G) and power producer(s) to the Finance Division. CPPA-G subsequently executed the finalized draft of RAA with multiple CPEC IPPs. The Government of Pakistan also guaranteed the funding obligations of the CPPA with respect to the RAA, through Supplemental Implementation Agreements signed between the Government of Pakistan — through the Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) — and the respective IPPs. 5.

Lahore, the capital of Punjab province, is Pakistan’s most populous and prosperous province with more than 5 million people. Pakistani officials expected the new transport system, the first of its kind in the country, to substantially decrease road traffic. Then, on December 21, 2015, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed three separate loan agreements for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project. The first loan agreement is a $203.25 million buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement [ID#BC-OLL-2015 and ID#2015212493]. It carries a 5.2% interest rate, 2 year grace period, and 20 year maturity (captured via Project ID#53820). The second loan agreement is a $1,235,480,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2015) 34 TOTAL NO. (377) or ID#PBC-OLL15-34377]. It carries a 20 year maturity and a 2% interest rate (captured via Project ID#37280). The third loan agreement is an RMB 1,200,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) loan agreement [ID#GCL-OLL15-20559 or CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2015) 20 TOTAL NO. (559)]. It carries a 2% interest rate and 20 year maturity (captured via Project ID#54420). The proceeds of the GCL, PBC, and BCL were used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract between Punjab Mass Transit Authority (PMA) and CR-NORINCO [a joint venture of China State Railway Group Co. Ltd. (CR) and China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO)], which was signed on April 20, 2015.   According to the Government of Pakistan’s Economic Affairs Division, $672.7 million of the “mixed credit” (GCL, PBC, and BCL) from China Eximbank had been disbursed as of June 30, 2017.  The Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project involved the construction of a 27km two-lane metro bus corridor runs through the heart of Lahore along Multan Road, McLeod Road, and GT Road. Upon completion, the Orange Metro Line was expected to have capacity for 30,000 passenger per hour and serve 250,000 passengers per day.   CR-NORINCO — a joint venture of China State Railway Group Co. Ltd. (CR) and China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) — was the entity responsible for project implementation. The project was initially expected to begin by the end of 2014 and last for 27 months (estimated completed date: March 31, 2017). The project was ultimately completed on December 10, 2019. However, it encountered various problems and delays during implementation. The Lahore Development Authority began marking sites for demolition in August 2015, including government buildings, royal tombs, mosques, schools, and residences. Civil works were then initiated by CN-NORINCO on October 25, 2015. Popular protests prompted the Lahore high court to suspend work surrounding heritage sites in January 2016 while the court deliberated the issue. Then, in August 2016, the Lahore high court ruled that the government could not evict people or harm the heritage sites. The Punjab provincial government challenged the ruling, and in April 2017, the Supreme Court reversed its decision, allowing construction to continue under 31 conditions to limit the disruption and damage of the project. Then, in May 2019, a special audit of the project project was submitted to the federal government. The audit revealed losses to the national exchequer and alleged irregularities worth billions of rupees. More specifically, the audit disclosed that no framework agreement existed between the federal and provincial governments and that sub-contractors were granted several contracts without any approval. The audit claimed that a loss of $1,528,000 had been incurred to the national exchequer. It also claimed more than $1.4 million had been spent on the basis of favoritism with regard to project allowance.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank government concessional loan for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the government concessional loan agreement for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project.

The Lahore Development Authority began marking sites for demolition in August 2015, including government buildings, royal tombs, mosques, schools, and residences. Civil works were then initiated by CN-NORINCO on October 25, 2015. Popular protests prompted the Lahore high court to suspend work surrounding heritage sites in January 2016 while the court deliberated the issue. Then, in August 2016, the Lahore high court ruled that the government could not evict people or harm the heritage sites. The Punjab provincial government challenged the ruling, and in April 2017, the Supreme Court reversed its decision, allowing construction to continue under 31 conditions to limit the disruption and damage of the project. Then, in May 2019, a special audit of the project project was submitted to the federal government. The audit revealed losses to the national exchequer and alleged irregularities worth billions of rupees. More specifically, the audit disclosed that no framework agreement existed between the federal and provincial governments and that sub-contractors were granted several contracts without any approval. The audit claimed that a loss of $1,528,000 had been incurred to the national exchequer. It also claimed more than $1.4 million had been spent on the basis of favoritism with regard to project allowance.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank government concessional loan for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the government concessional loan agreement for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project. Then, on November 19, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE1-030].

The project was implemented on a build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) basis and it involved the construction of a 100 MW solar PV power plant located at Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park at Lal Sohanra in Cholistan within Bahawalpur District of the Province of Punjab. China First Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd and MCC Ruba International Construction Company (Pvt) Ltd were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. This project reached its commercial operations date (COD) on May 31, 2016.   However, this project has encountered debt repayment and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. In May 2022, reports emerged that the Government of Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to Zonergy and its subsidiaries/SPVs. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 10.4 billion (approximately $52 million). Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this “[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).","1. The project implementation start date is unknown. For the time being, AidData relies on the financial closure date as a proxy for the project implementation start date, since this is typically the date of the first loan disbursement. 2. According to multiple, official sources, the Government of Pakistan has issued sovereign guarantees in support of all loans issued by Chinese state-owned banks for independent power projects (IPPs) in Pakistan (see https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cepk/chn/zbgx/t1735166.htm and http://pk.chineseembassy.org/eng/zbgx/202110/t20211010_9558510.htm and https://www.dropbox.com/s/bmx3w2b38o7guxm/Debt%20Pricing%20of%20IPPs%20%28002%29.pdf?dl=0). As such, AidData assumes that the loan captured in this record is backed by a sovereign guarantee from the Government of Pakistan. 3. The individual contributions of China Eximbank and CDB to the $62.6 million syndicated loan are unknown. For the time being, AidData estimates that each of the two Chinese state-owned banks contributed equal amounts ($31.3 million). 4. On November 8, 2014, the Chinese Government and the Government of Pakistan signed a CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement. According to Article 5 of the Agreement, ‘the Pakistani Party agrees that a revolving account shall be opened with 30 days of commercial operation of the respective project, into which the money, no less than the 22 per cent of the monthly payments for the respective power project under the agreement shall be deposited to provide cover for the shortfall in power bill recoveries from the date of power generation of the said projects agreements subject to the condition that the additional direct and indirect expenses incurred in maintaining the revolving account would be compensated by the producers through a discount arrangement to be mutually agreed.’ Subsequently, the Finance Division, in consultation with the Power Division, finalized a mechanism for the Revolving Account (RA) with the approval of The Minister of Finance in a letter dated June 22, 2015. Then, in September 2017, the Power Division forwarded a draft Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) to be signed between Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guaranteed (CPPA-G) and power producer(s) to the Finance Division. CPPA-G subsequently executed the finalized draft of RAA with multiple CPEC IPPs. The Government of Pakistan also guaranteed the funding obligations of the CPPA with respect to the RAA, through Supplemental Implementation Agreements signed between the Government of Pakistan — through the Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) — and the respective IPPs. 5.

# Title
[CPEC, IPP] CDB contributes to RMB 400 million syndicated loan for 100 MW Solar PV Power Plant in Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park (Linked to Project ID #50939, #54287, #92501, #53985)

# Description
On October 16, 2015, Apollo Solar Development Pakistan Limited (ASDPL) — a project company (special purpose vehicle) established by Zonergy Company Limited, itself a subsidiary of ZTE Corporation — signed two different syndicated loan agreements with China Eximbank and China Development Bank (CDB) for the 100 MW Solar PV Power Plant in Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park. The first is an RMB 400 million syndicated loan agreement with a 2.65% interest rate and a 10-year maturity. China Eximbank's contribution to the RMB-denominated facility is captured in Project ID#53985 and CDB's contribution to the RMB-denominated facility is captured in Project ID#92503. The second is a $62.6 million syndicated loan agreement with an interest rate of 4.96% (LIBOR plus 4.2%) and a 10-year maturity. China Eximbank's contribution to the USD-denominated facility is captured in Project ID#54287 and CDB's contribution to the USD-denominated facility is captured in Project ID#92501.   The borrower purchased credit insurance from Sinosure for both of these syndicated loans. The borrower, ASDPL, was expected to use the loan proceeds to partially finance two commercial (EPC) contracts that it signed on on June 27, 2015: an RMB 863.316 million offshore supply contract that it signed with China First Metallurgical Group Co. Ltd. and an RMB 135.683 million onshore construction contract with MCC Ruba International Construction Company (Pvt) Ltd. The total project cost was $149.154 million and it was financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 79:21. ASDPL achieved financial close on November 6, 2015, which is typically the date of the first loan disbursement.
