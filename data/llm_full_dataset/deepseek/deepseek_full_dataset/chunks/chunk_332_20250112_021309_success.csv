(Peace Cable 公司)— a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of Hengtong Marine Cable System Co., Ltd. that was founded in 2018 and registered in Hong Kong — subsequently signed three loan agreements with Bank of China, China Construction Bank Corporation, and China CITIC Bank Corporation Limited for the Peace Submarine Cable Project: an RMB 335,080,000 loan (ID# 544375468083) from the Suzhou Yangtze River Delta Integration Demonstration Zone Branch of Bank of China Co., Ltd.  (中国银行股份有限公司苏州长三角一体化示范区分行), an RMB 1,754,810,000 loan (ID# 32250199763600002810) from the Suzhou Branch of China Construction Bank Corporation (中国建设银行股份有限公司苏州分行), and an RMB 640,110,000 loan from the Suzhou Branch of China CITIC Bank Corporation Limited (中信银行股份有限公司苏州分行). The loan from Bank of China is captured via Project ID#92354. The loan from China Construction Bank Corporation is captured via Project ID#92355 (this project). The loan from China CITIC Bank Corporation Limited is captured via Project ID#92356. The borrowing terms of these three loans are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was expected to use proceeds of these loans (collectively worth RMB 2,730,000,000) to finance approximately 96% of the total cost (RMB 2,835,132,000) of the project.  The purpose of the project is to lay 15,000 km of submarine fiber optic cable between Asia, Africa and Europe. The project’s ultimate aim is to reduce latency and provide ‘a new information expressway for interconnection between the regions.’ Phase 1 of the project (spanning 12,000 km) will link France to Pakistan (the port of Gwadar and Karachi) through a single landing point in the city of Marseille (France) using the Europe-Asia route, and to the city of Mombasa (Kenya) via a short route towards the Indian Ocean that will be expanded to South Africa via the PEACE South extension under Phase 2, reaching a total length of 15,000 km. The cable system will also reach Djibouti and Egypt by docking with existing land cables. The system will deploy 200G and WSS technologies, which provide capabilities to transmit 16Tbps per fiber pair.  Upon completion, the project is expected to provide a new information super highway for countries in Asia, Africa and Europe, and dramatically reduce the length and delay of routes between China and Africa.
