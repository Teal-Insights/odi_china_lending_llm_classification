The purpose of this project was to improve rice yields on the island of Vanua Levu. This MoU was one of 21 commercial and government MOUs signed during the Fiji-China (Guangdong) Economic and Trade Cooperation Conference held at Grand Pacific Hotel in Suva, Fiji.   The project was implemented by China Shandong International Economic and Technical Cooperation Group Limited in technical partnership with hybrid rice seed company, Yuan Longping High-Tech Agriculture Company Limited. Under this cooperation framework, a rice development project was formed in the Dreketi irrigated areas within Muanicula province on the island of Vanua Levu. The project area of 200 ha was used to establish, demonstrate, and disseminate high yielding rice cultivation techniques to increase yield in large-scale rice production.

The aim of the project was to bring Fiji’s rice industry closer to self-sufficiency by helping local farmers to meet domestic demand, which will reduce dependency on rice imports, and to revitalize the rice industry. The project reportedly increased the rice yield of 6.31 tons per hectare, which is more than twice the local average, providing much-needed assistance to rice farmers in Dreketi and Koronivia.","On December 17, 2015, the Chinese Government also donated $5 million worth of agricultural machinery to support Phase 1 of the Rice Revitalization Project (see Project ID#65824).
