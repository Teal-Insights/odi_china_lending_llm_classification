According to the Uganda Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development's Report on Public Debt, Grants, Guarantees and Other Financial Liabilities for Financial Year 2021/2022, as of December 31, 2021, total loan disbursements amounted to $84,979,502.53 and the loan’s amount outstanding (including arrears) was $74,357,064.70.   The objective of the project is provision of adequate transmission capacity to cater for the projected demand from within 4 industrial park areas. The project has 4 components: (1) Construction of Luzira Industrial Park 132/33kV Substation and Transmission Line Project (15 km); (2) Construction of Mukono Industrial Park 132/33kV Substation and Transmission Line Project (5 km); (3) Construction of Iganga Industrial Park 132/33kV Substation and Transmission Line Project (10 km); and (4) Construction of Namanve Industrial Park 132/33kV Substation and Transmission Line Project (5 km).   China CAMCE Engineering Co. Ltd is the contractor responsible for project implementation. The project officially commenced implementation on June 29, 2016.

This project has encountered multiple obstacles and delays during implementation. First, due to compensation delays that arose from the wetland ownership queries and a notice to cancel the titles within the wetland, one of the wetland claimants went ahead and built a printery at the terminal tower spot of the Luzira transmission line corridor. Second, an increase in a nearby lake’s water level has affected the Luzira wetland, thus making construction harder for the contractor. (The Luzira transmission line corridor is located in Luzira wetland; therefore, access to the tower spots has proven very difficult during construction of tower foundations and tower erection.) Third, as of October 26, 2021, there were still right of way (RoW) acquisition issues at Luzira Port Bell Market, Miami Beach, Kilombe and Panda PL Villages.
