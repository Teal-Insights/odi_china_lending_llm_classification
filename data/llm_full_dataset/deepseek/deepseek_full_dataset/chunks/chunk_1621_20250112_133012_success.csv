Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility,  carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections. The process was managed by an office in the Angolan Ministry of Finance -- known as Gabinete de Apoio Técnico (GAT) -- that was specifically created to manage the MLFA with China Eximbank.  In March 2005, China Eximbank and the Government of Angola signed a $63,792,501.10 subsidiary buyer’s credit loan agreement under the MLFA for acquisition of ten 33.56-meter fishing boats, one 49-meter speedboat, one 89.96-meter naval launching station, five 29.7-meter fiberglass patrol vessels, and one 34-meter tugboat. The proceeds of this loan were used to partially finance a  $70,880,779.00 commercial (EPC) contract with China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC), which was signed in January 2006.  The purpose of the project was to facilitate the acquisition of ten 33.56-meter fishing boats, one 49-meter speedboat, one 89.96-meter naval launching station, five 29.7-meter fiberglass patrol vessels, and one 34-meter tugboat.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda partnered with Stanford Financial Group Ltd and others in the construction of the new Mount St. John Medical Centre. As part of the partnership, Government of Antigua and Barbuda sought, and received, a $28 million loan from Stanford Financial Group Ltd for the hospital’s construction costs. The funds that Stanford Financial Group Ltd made available to the Government of Antigua and Barbuda for construction of the hospital were proceeds from the Stanford Enterprises, including funds that were fraudulently stolen. Allen Stanford was appointed as the Chairman of the Board of the hospital. Subsequently, an independent commission tasked with investigating allegations of corruption in the building of the hospital determined that the Government of Antigua and Barbuda had promised to repay the $28 million loan to Stanford Financial Group Ltd with funds that were taken directly from the government’s social security system. Thus, the purported ‘loan’ agreement was actually a fraudulent scheme between Antigua and Stanford designed to use $28 million of proceeds from the Stanford Enterprises to enable the Government of Antigua and Barbuda to loot its own social security system. As a result of the commission’s report, Allen Stanford resigned from the hospital’s Board of Directors. On June 14, 2012, Allen Stanford was sentenced to 110 years in prison.
