57333,WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION,China Eximbank provides $678.3 million buyer's credit loan for Project to Supply Potable Water to Yaoundé and its Outskirts from the River Sanaga (PAEPYS),"On January 20, 2015, China Eximbank and the Ministry of Economy, Planning and Regional Development of the Republic of Cameroon signed a buyer's credit loan (BCL) agreement (Contract No. 1410302052014212898) worth $678,300,000 for the Project to Supply Potable Water to Yaoundé and its Outskirts from the River Sanaga (PAEPYS). The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 15 year maturity, a 4 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.358% in January 2015) plus a 4% margin, a 1% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.30% commitment fee, and a 0.30% management fee. The borrower was also required to purchase buyer's credit insurance from Sinosure. The proceeds of the BCL were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the total cost of a commercial contract ($798,000,000) between Cameroon's Ministry of Water Resources and Energy and China National Machinery Industry Corporation (Sinomach), which was signed on October 28, 2014. As of December 31, 2020, the loan (BCL) had achieved a 49.4% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 184.1 billion) and its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 179.7 billion.   The purpose of the project is to supply potable water to Yaoundé, Batchenga, Obala, Nkometou, Soa and Ntui from the Sanaga River via the construction of a 62 km pipeline. According to Annex A of the loan agreement, the ""main objective of the project is as follows: the construction of a water station on the river Sanaga at the place called Nachtigal; the construction of a potable water treatment plant with a nominal capacity of [300,000] cubic meters/day; the installation of raw water supply pipes and treated water with a diameter of 1800 mm ductile pig iron on a total distance of about 62 km including their protecting equipments and piping system accessories; the construction of two water absorption stations at Nkometou II and at Nyom II; the construction of a storage tank of 6,000 cubic meters in Yaoundé on Mount Ndindan and connecting pipes to existing reservoirs in the Yaoundé city; the construction of a high voltage electric line from Oyom Abang to Nkometou II; the construction of average voltage lines from Nkometou II towards Nyom II, Batchenga and Nachtigal; the supply of 18 vehicles for works and management of installations (one truck with lifting crane, two Toyota Coasters, two Toyoto Land Cruiser, two Toyota Pick up Hilux, three Toyota Prado, five Toyota Berline Corolla); the installation of a remote management system of facilities built within the project framework; the construction and installation of any related infrastructure and equipment; the supply of spare parts. Upon completion, the project is expected to produce 300,000 m3 (cubic meters) of water per day, expandable to 400,000 m3 (cubic meters) per day, and its implementation is expected solve the problem of insufficient potable water supply in Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.   Construction began in December 2014 and was expected to reach completion by December 2017. However, as of September 2018, the project had only achieved a 30% completion rate. The first batch of equipment that was acquired with the proceeds of the loan -- in particular, the water pipes -- was received in October 2017 and forwarded to the project's storage sites in Nkometou. As of October 2020, the project had only achieved a 68% completion rate due to delays caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Work was also delayed due to the late release of rights of way and the non-payment of Sinomach’s invoices for several months. Project implementation was accelerated between October 2020 and October 2021; in particular, there was a significant increase in the laying of pipes from 800 meters in 2020 to 27 kilometers in 2021. These and other actions undertaken through October 2021 brought the overall completion (physical execution) rate of the project to 81.5%. As of October 2021, the Nachtigal raw water collection and pumping station had achieved a 97% completion rate; the water treatment plant at Emana Batchenga had achieved a 98.5% completion rate; the 90kV/30kV transformer substation at Nkometou had achieved a 97.6% completion rate; the treated water pumping station at Nkometou had achieved a 96.1% completion rate; the treated water pumping station at Nyom had achieved a 61% completion rate; the Ndindan treated water tank had achieved a 5.2% completion rate; and the project component focused on the laying of pipes from Nachtigal to Yaounde had achieved a 36% completion rate. The project is now slated for completion on July 22, 2022.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Project to Supply Potable Water to Yaoundé and its Outskirts from the River Sanaga (PAEPYS) may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.’","1.

Project ID#53234 captures the loan from Bank of China for Phase 2 of the Solar Rural Electrification Project.   The purpose of the Solar Rural Electrification Project was to supply, install and operate photovoltaic infrastructure (known as solar mini-grids or solar micro-grids) in 350 localities (villages and towns) in Cameroon. The project, which was implemented in two phases, sought to cover 58 states within 10 major regions across the country and deliver 70MW of solar energy to 150,000 people across 1,000 sites and 350 localities. Phase 1 targeted 166 localities and Phase 2 targeted 184 localities. It was originally envisaged that villagers would pay less than FCFA 100 for a kilowatt of power once the project was fully operational.   Huawei was the contractor responsible for the implementation of both phases of the project. Phase 1 officially commenced on November 29, 2016. Huawei reportedly installed a number of solar-backed micro-grid systems across the country in 2017, with systems ranging from 30 kW to 300 kW in size, featuring advanced maximum power point tracker (MPPT) technology, high-efficiency inverters, and advanced charging-discharging management. Phase 1 ultimately delivered 11.2MW of solar energy to 166 localities (villages and towns) and it reportedly benefited between 13,984 and 22,240 households (including 3,100 households that secured electricity connections in 2021). These localities received electricity from a solar power plant in the village of Nsem, which was officially commissioned in November 24, 2018. However, the first phase of the project was plagued by accusations of corruption and embezzlement. As of late 2021, Phase 1 was not yet complete. However, the management of all photovoltaic infrastructure that was installed during Phase 1 was handed over to Cameroon’s Rural Electrification Agency in February 2021.   Phase 2 commenced in 2018, and as of December 14, 2018, it had achieved a 31% completion rate. As of late 2021, all Phase 2 construction activities were complete and 9,820 household electricity connections had been established (including 3,946 in 2021), but the Phase 2 campaign to increase the number of households with electricity connections was still underway and efforts to transfer management of all photovoltaic infrastructure installed during Phase 2 to Cameroon’s Rural Electrification Agency were ongoing. In November 2020, the Government of Cameroon announced plans to pursue a third phase of the project, which would seek to reach an additional 200 localities (villages and towns).

This loan was intended to finance part of Fortune Lianjiang Shipping SA'S US$1.2 billion agreement with Golar Hilli Corporation, a company incorporated in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, for the acquisition of the FLNG production vessel ""Hilli Episeoyo.""    On September 9, 2015, Fortune Lianjiang Shipping SA and Golar Hilli Corporation signed the memorandum of agreement for acquiring the vessel. In the 2015 pre-delivery financing agreements, Fortune Lianjiang Shipping S.A. partially financed the FLNG conversion works, which were backed by China Development Bank’s senior loan. For this agreement, Golar Hilli Corp. sold and leased back the Hilli vessel from Fortune Lianjiang Shipping S.A. under a 10-year bareboat charter agreement, which provides for post-construction financing of the Hilli of $960 million that Hilli Corp. will pay to Fortune Lianjiang Shipping S.A. in 40 consecutive equal quarterly repayments.    On June 24, 2018, Golar Hilli Corp. repaid $640.0 million on the pre-delivery credit facility and drew down $960.0 million on the post-acceptance sale and leaseback financing in relation to the FLNG Hilli facility. The Hilli Episeyo is sub-Saharan Africa’s first floating LNG unit. Since its commissioning in 2018, it has operated at half capacity (1.2 mtpa), which will be increased to 1.4 mtpa next year. The capacity increase will be accompanied by the drilling and appraisal of two to three incremental gas wells by the end of 2021 and an upgrade of upstream facilities next year. At the end of 2020, Perenco had already completed works on the Sanaga 2 gas compression platform, which fall within phase 2 of the FLNG project and is already supporting gas production levels at the Hilli Episeyo. It is located off the shore of Cameroon (exact locational coordinates: 3.017162, 9.837292).   The Marshall Islands-flagged FLNG production vessel was accepted under its Liquefaction Tolling Agreement with Anglo-French oil and gas company Perenco and Cameroon’s state-owned Societe Nationale des Hydrocarbures on June 4, 2018, and subsequently delivered to Fortune Lianjiang Shipping S.A. on June 20, 2018, at which point Fortune Lianjiang Shipping S.A. took full ownership of the vessel and a bareboat charter with Golar Hilli Corporation became effective. The vessel is already fully operating off the coast of Cameroon and the first of its cargoes has arrived in China. The Hilli Episeyo FLNG project develops Cameroon’s gas both for exports and for the domestic market. While all produced LNG is sold to Gazprom Marketing & Trading, the unit also produces up to 5,000 bpd of condensates and up to 30,000 tonnes of LPG for local consumption. As a result, Cameroon’s LPG imports were reduced by half following completion of all associated gas infrastructure three years ago. The project required substantial infrastructure development, including at the existing onshore Bipaga gas treatment plant which had until then been used to process and supply gas to the 214 MW Kribi gas-to-power plant. On top of 56km of pipeline infrastructure, new facilities were built to provide for the smooth operations of both projects, and the production of condensates and LPG.",1.
