The contract included 15 years of operational support services, a comprehensive training program, and an insurance policy. The NigComSat-1 Communications Satellite Project officially commenced on February 21, 2005.

The PBC carried the following terms: 12 year maturity, 4 year grace period, and a 3% interest rate. The final maturity date of the loan is March 21, 2018.   In anticipation of the launch of Nigeria’s first communications satellite, Nigeria’s Federal Ministry of Communications Technology established a state-owned company called Nigerian Communications Satellite (NIGCOMSAT) Limited on April 4, 2006. It was envisaged that NIGCOMSAT Limited would sell fixed satellite services to much of Africa and Italy. The NigcomSat-1 communications satellite was equipped with 28 transponders on board in four frequency bands (8 Ka-band, 14 Ku-band, 4C-band and 2 L-band). In order to satisfy the coverage area requirements, the satellite was fitted with a total of seven shaped communication antennae. With a lift-off mass of 5,086 kg, the satellite was to be positioned at 42 degrees east longitude over the equator, with an end-of-life power of over 8KW, and a design orbit life span of 15 years. On May 14, 2007, NigComSat-1 was successfully launched from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center (XSLC) aboard an enhanced LM-3B (LM-3B/E) launch vehicle. Then, on July 6, 2007, CGWIC delivered the NigComSat-1 satellite in orbit to Nigerian Communications Satellite Ltd.
