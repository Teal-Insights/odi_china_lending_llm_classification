This loan carried the following terms: a maturity of 25 years, a grace period of 5 years, and an estimated interest rate of 1.8728%.  The purpose of the project was to install 13,000 solar-powered streetlights across Togo. The installation of the solar-power streetlights was prioritized in dispensaries, schools, markets and other public places. The completed project was to provide lighting for 144 km of road, improving traffic safety at night.
