The project was implemented in two phases and divided into 15 segments (or ‘lots’). It was envisaged that the project would increase the supply of reliable power to the Nile River Delta region, promote upstream and downstream industries in Egypt, and create 7,000 new jobs.  China Electric Power Equipment and Technology Co., Ltd. (CET) — a subsidiary of SGCC — was the general contractor responsible for the implementation. However, it hired several subcontractors, including China Energy Engineering Corporation (CEEC), Hubei Engineering Co., Ltd., and Power Construction Corporation of China (PowerChina). It also hired Jiangsu Zhongtian Technologies Software Technology Co., Ltd, a private Chinese company, for all line equipment and electric metal fittings. The project officially commenced on May 6, 2016. Then, on November 3, 2016, 3 transmission lines with a total length of 380 km (part of Phase 1) were successfully put into operation. In May 2017, the construction of an additional transmission line was completed. On September 4, 2017, an agreement on Phase 2 was signed during the BRICS summit. The same month witnessed the completion of a 94 km section that began in April 2016 and was undertaken by Hubei Engineering Co., Ltd. By the end of 2017, the borrower had drawn $115,000,000 from CDB’s contribution to the syndicated loan. However, the size of the borrower’s drawdowns from the Bank of China’s contribution and China Eximbank’s contribution are unknown.  Another 80 km segment was completed on November 26, 2018. Two additional transmission lines — an 80 km line from Samanoud to Banha and a 94 km line from Borosus to Samanoud — were completed by Hubei Engineering Co., Ltd. in January 2019. As of mid-2019, the project had achieved a 96% completion rate. By the end of June 2019, another 194 km of lines were constructed and the project reached full completion.",TRUE,NA,GREY,HIGH,Grid Infrastructure,Project focuses on transmission infrastructure that can support both renewable and non-renewable energy sources,"Construction of 1,210 km of high voltage transmission lines, connection to gas-fired power stations, grid capacity expansion"
