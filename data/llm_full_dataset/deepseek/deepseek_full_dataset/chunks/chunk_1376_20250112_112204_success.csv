The interest-free loan that MOFCOM issued in 2009 for Phase 1 of the National Stadium Construction Project is not included in the database of Chinese loan commitments to African governments that SAIS-CARI released in 2020. AidData currently codes this project as though it was funded through a single interest-free loan. However, some sources suggest that the Chinese Government’s RMB 136.12 million financial commitment for this project was fulfilled with a mix of funding from grants and interest-free loans. This issue merits further investigation.3. Since the borrowing terms of the interest-free loan are unavailable, AidData has set the maturity to 20 years by default and grace period to 10 years by default per China's Foreign Assistance White Paper (http://www.cidca.gov.cn/2018-08/06/c_129925064_3.htm) which states that the maturity period of interest-free loans is 20 years, with a drawdown period of 5 years, grace period of 5 years, and repayment over 10 years.
