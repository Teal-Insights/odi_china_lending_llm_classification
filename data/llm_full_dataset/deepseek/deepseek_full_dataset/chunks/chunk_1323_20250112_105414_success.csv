With its subsidiaries, it is developing 13 medium and large-sized power projects with a combined planned installed capacity of 33,480 MW. 2. The Chinese name for this project is 印度莎圣项目. 3. The exact size of China Development Bank, and China Exim Bank's respective financial contributions to the $1.114 billion syndicated loan are unknown. However, it is reported that the three banks contributed $1 billion in total. Thus, for the time being, AidData assumes that all 3 Chinese members of the lending syndicate contributed equal amounts ($333,333,333). The CDB's portion is captured in #54362, China Eximbank's portion is captured in #92020, and Bank of China's portion is captured in #92021.","# Sector

Bank of China contributes $333 million to $1.114 billion syndicated loan for 3,960 MW Coal-Fired Sasan Ultra Mega Power Project (UMPP) (Linked to Project ID#43106, #54362, #92020)

# Description
On December 15, 2010, China Development Bank (CDB), the Bank of China (BOC), the Export-Import of China, and Standard Chartered Bank signed a $1.114 billion syndicated loan agreement with Reliance Power Limited (R-Power) for the 3,960MW Coal-Fired Sasan Ultra Mega Power Project (UMPP).     CDB, BOC, and China Eximbank's contributions to the $1.114 billion USD syndicated loan reportedly totaled $1 billion USD. Because it is unclear how much each bank contributed, AidData assumes the three Chinese banks contributed equally ($333,333,333). The CDB's portion is captured in #54362, China Eximbank's portion is captured in #92020, and Bank of China's portion is captured in #92021. The loan carried a maturity period of 13 years and it is insured by Sinosure. Reliance Power announced that its 3960 MW Sasan Ultra Mega Power Project (SUMPP) has received the final commitment of term loans of Rs 5,000 crore ($1,114 million USD).     The UMPP involved the construction and operation of a 3,960 MW coal-fired power plant and a captive coal mine in the village of Singrauli within the state of Madhya Pradesh. The proceeds from the syndicated loan were to be primarily used to purchase power equipment from Shanghai Electric. The UMPP, which was officially commissioned on March 30, 2015, has 6 power towers of 660MW each and was a 'super-critical technology-based pit-head coal-fired power generating plant.'
