The Green Port’s designed storage capacity was around 43,5000m2. It was designed to handle vessels weighing around 50,000 tons. The Phase 1 project scope also involved 1 workboat berth, a yard behind the port, road work and revetment works of 1,140 meters, and the supply and installation of related supporting facilities.   CHEC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Phase 1, per the terms of the EPC contract, was originally expected to commence in October 2001 and conclude in June 2003.

In a typical receivables financing agreement (or deferred payment agreement), the company that the project owner in the host country has selected as its engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor is also a lender to the project owner. The company assigns receivables under its EPC contract with the project owner to one of or more banks. Upon assignment of receivables, the bank or banks will release funds to the company so it can discharge its obligations under the receivables financing agreement  as a lender. Receivables financing is also known as accounts receivable financing (finance) or A/R financing (finance) or 应收账款融资 (in Chinese). These other terms are used because the accounts receivable of a company (i.e., unpaid invoices) are being used as collateral to unlock working capital—typically in the form of a bank loan (‘receivables loan’). Sellers often face cash flow problems when their buyers do not make full payment at the due date of the invoice. A receivables financing arrangement addresses this problem by allowing them to sell their outstanding invoices to a bank at a discounted rate. This approach allows the seller to receive the remaining invoice amount before the due date of the invoice. The bank either gets its money back at invoice maturity through the seller (acting as a collecting agent) or directly from the debtor.3.

The loans forgiven through this action were interest-free loans committed through previous ETCAs signed by the two governments. As such, the loans likely had maturity lengths of 20 years and since they had reached maturity by 1999, they were necessarily contracted prior to 2000. Therefore, AidData has not assigned this record to the umbrella category (as there is little risk of double counting the monetary value of the debts that were forgiven).","# Sector
