54106,ENERGY,"China Eximbank provides $15 million loan for Phase 1 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#46211, #71101, #71137, #91801)","On July 4, 2009, the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank) and China Development Bank (CDB) signed $30 million loan agreement with the Ministry of Energy and Industry of Tajikistan for Phase 1 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. Project ID#54106 captures the $15 million contribution from China Eximbank and Project ID#71101 captures the $15 million contribution from CDB. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown.   Then, in 2012, TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC (特变电工杜尚别矿业有限 or 特变电工杜尚别矿业有限公司 or ТВЕА Душанбе горная промышленность) — a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of TBEA — signed a $179 million loan agreement with China Eximbank for the Phase 1 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project (captured via Project ID#91801). The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the loan was part of a trilateral ‘resources-for-infrastructure’ agreement between the Tajik Ministry of Energy, TBEA, and TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC. Under the terms of the ‘resources-for-infrastructure’ agreement, TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC agreed to ‘front’ $179 million for the construction of Phase 1 by borrowing directly from China Eximbank, and, in turn, the Tajik Government agreed to grant TBEA exclusive rights to explore and develop gold deposits at the Eastern Duoba mine and the Upper Kumarg mine (until TBEA could recoup its investment). The Tajik Government also reportedly agreed to give TBEA the rights to further mining deposits (at an unidentified location) if the profit made from the gold deposits at the Eastern Duoba mine and the Upper Kumarg mine did not cover the cost of Phase 1 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. Also, as part of the ‘resources-for-infrastructure’ agreement, TBEA was reportedly exempted from paying customs duties and value added tax (VAT) on imported equipment necessary for exploration and development of the deposits. The tax and customs exemptions were scheduled to cease once TBEA recouped its initial costs. However, the agreement allowed TBEA to continue to mine the gold deposits for profit after the expiration of the exemptions.   Then, in 2014, the Export-Import Bank of China provided two loans — a RMB 929,977,078 government concessional loan (GCL) (captured via Project ID#46211) and a $178,969,220 preferential buyer’s credit loan (PBC) (captured via Project ID#71137) for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. Both of these loans were ratified by the Tajik Parliament on January 14, 2015. The GCL was contracted by the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and it carried the following borrowing terms: a 25 year maturity, an 11 year grace period, and a 1.5% interest rate. The PBC carries a 20 year maturity, a 9 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The Government of Tajikistan contributed $17,443,400 of counterpart financing. In total, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan contracted $331,058,220 of China Eximbank debt for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. The Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds of the GCL and the PBC to on-lend to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) “Barqi Tojik”. OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy. The subsidiary GCL agreement (#TАJ 2014-028-2) was signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” on December 18, 2014. It carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 25 years. Its final maturity date was set to August 21, 2039. The subsidiary PBC agreement (#TАJ 2014-028-1) was also signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” on December 18, 2014 and it carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 20 years. Its final maturity date was set to June 21, 2034.   Dushanbe 2 is a combined heat and power plant (CHP) — also known as the Dushanbe-2 Thermal Power Plant (TPS-2) — that provides heat and electricity for the residents of Dushanbe. It only operates in the winter. The 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project was designed and implemented in two phases. The power plant was to be fueled by coal, with the potential to switch to gas. Phase 1 (mainly constructed between 2012-2014) installed a capacity of 100 MW, while Phase 2 (constructed between 2014-2016) installed an additional capacity of 300 MW. TBEA was the general contractor responsible for implementation of both phases. Henan No 1 Thermal Power Construction Company was also involved in the implementation of Phase 1. Inner Mongolia Electric Power Survey and Design Institute Co., Ltd. was the contractor responsible for the design for Phase 2. Hydro Electric Power System Engineering Company was also involved in the implementation of Phase 2.   Phase 1 was originally scheduled to be completed and put into production before the celebration of the 20th anniversary of Tajik independence in 2011 (on September 9, 2011), and the second phase was scheduled to be completed in 2013. A formal groundbreaking ceremony for Phase 1 took place on September 8, 2009. However, construction did not begin until November 2012. Phase 1 was completed on September 13, 2014 and the first two (50MW) power generation units were put into operation on November 10, 2014. Phase 2 began on May 14, 2015 and was completed on December 8, 2016. According to President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon as relayed by TBEA, the power plant generates 9.6 million kWh power per day and 235 trillion Kcal heat, and it provides nearly 700 stable jobs to Tajiks. The electricity generated from the power plant is sold to Barki Tojik Open Stock Holding Power under a power purchase agreement. Through this project, 150 Tajik technicians went to China for training, and about 100 Tajik operators received professional know-how from Chinese experts. According to Xinhua, the completed power plant met 60 percent of the power demand and restarted the provision of central heating to more than 700,000 Dushanbe residents after 15 years of suspension. The completion of the power plant was declared to be a solution to Tajikistan's long-existing issue of power shortages during the winter.   However, it appears that the project’s second phase has encountered revenue generation and loan repayment problems. In 2018, the Government of Tajikistan reportedly granted a gold mining license to TBEA as ‘remuneration’ for Phase 2. Media reports indicate that TBEA agreed to work on the gold deposits as long as it takes to recoup the costs that it incurred during the construction of Phase 2. Several years later, in November 2021, TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC reported that it had completed half of the work on the construction of the gold processing plant and ancillary facilities in Ayni district of the northern province of Sughd, Tajikistan. The purpose of these facilities is to support the development of the Kumarghi Bolo (Upper Kumargh) and Duobai Sharqi (Eastern Duoba) gold deposits. TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC completed geological exploration works on the Upper Kumarg gold mine in October 2016.","1. This project is also known as the Dushanbe-2 CHP Plant Unit I Project or the First Stage of the Dushanbe-2 CHPP (2 x 50 MW) Project. The Russian project title is Душанбинская ТЭЦ-2. The Chinese project title is 塔吉克斯坦杜尚别2*5万千瓦火电站一期工程项目 or 塔吉克斯坦杜尚别-2号火电 or 塔吉克斯坦2×50MW 杜尚别2 号火电站一期工程项目 or 杜尚别2*5 万千瓦火电站一期工程项目 or 塔吉克斯坦杜尚别热电联产电厂工程项目 or 塔吉克斯坦杜尚别2×50MW热电联产项目 or 塔吉克斯坦杜尚别-2号火电. 2. In the Government of Tajikistan’s Aid Information Management System (AIMS), the project is referred to as ‘Project of construction of second in succession construction of 'TPS-2' in Dushanbe 2. Some sources suggest that major delays took place after Tajikistan contracted this loan on July 4, 2009. The ceremony for the beginning of Phase 1 was on September 8, 2009, but construction did not begin in earnest until 2012. 3. On January 30, 2014, the Tajik Minister of Energy and Water Resources Usmonali Usmonov said at a news conference that ‘China’s Xinjiang Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock Co. Ltd (TBEA) has agreed to construct the plant at these terms […]. TBEA has taken a 179 million USD loan from the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank) at its own risk for construction of the plant.’ Also, in a company note, TBEA announced that it would cover the costs of Phase 1 in return for the rights to explore and develop three (rather than two) gold deposits in Ayni district of Sughd province. This issue warrants further investigation. 4. It is important to note that the Economic and Commercial Office of the Chinese Embassy reported in 2009 that TBEA was to receive mining rights in return for the project, before the ‘resources-for-infrastructure’ deal took place.","# Sector

Inner Mongolia Electric Power Survey and Design Institute Co., Ltd. was the contractor responsible for the design for Phase 2. Hydro Electric Power System Engineering Company was also involved in the implementation of Phase 2.   Phase 1 was originally scheduled to be completed and put into production before the celebration of the 20th anniversary of Tajik independence in 2011 (on September 9, 2011), and the second phase was scheduled to be completed in 2013. A formal groundbreaking ceremony for Phase 1 took place on September 8, 2009. However, construction did not begin until November 2012. Phase 1 was completed on September 13, 2014 and the first two (50MW) power generation units were put into operation on November 10, 2014. Phase 2 began on May 14, 2015 and was completed on December 8, 2016. According to President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon as relayed by TBEA, the power plant generates 9.6 million kWh power per day and 235 trillion Kcal heat, and it provides nearly 700 stable jobs to Tajiks. The electricity generated from the power plant is sold to Barki Tojik Open Stock Holding Power under a power purchase agreement. Through this project, 150 Tajik technicians went to China for training, and about 100 Tajik operators received professional know-how from Chinese experts. According to Xinhua, the completed power plant met 60 percent of the power demand and restarted the provision of central heating to more than 700,000 Dushanbe residents after 15 years of suspension. The completion of the power plant was declared to be a solution to Tajikistan's long-existing issue of power shortages during the winter.   However, it appears that the project’s second phase has encountered revenue generation and loan repayment problems. In 2018, the Government of Tajikistan reportedly granted a gold mining license to TBEA as ‘remuneration’ for Phase 2. Media reports indicate that TBEA agreed to work on the gold deposits as long as it takes to recoup the costs that it incurred during the construction of Phase 2. Several years later, in November 2021, TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC reported that it had completed half of the work on the construction of the gold processing plant and ancillary facilities in Ayni district of the northern province of Sughd, Tajikistan. The purpose of these facilities is to support the development of the Kumarghi Bolo (Upper Kumargh) and Duobai Sharqi (Eastern Duoba) gold deposits. TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC completed geological exploration works on the Upper Kumarg gold mine in October 2016.","1. This project is also known as the Dushanbe-2 CHP Plant Unit I Project or the First Stage of the Dushanbe-2 CHPP (2 x 50 MW) Project. The Russian project title is Душанбинская ТЭЦ-2. The Chinese project title is 塔吉克斯坦杜尚别2*5万千瓦火电站一期工程项目 or 塔吉克斯坦杜尚别-2号火电 or 塔吉克斯坦2×50MW 杜尚别2 号火电站一期工程项目 or 杜尚别2*5 万千瓦火电站一期工程项目 or 塔吉克斯坦杜尚别热电联产电厂工程项目 or 塔吉克斯坦杜尚别2×50MW热电联产项目 or 塔吉克斯坦杜尚别-2号火电. 2. In the Government of Tajikistan’s Aid Information Management System (AIMS), the project is referred to as ‘Project of construction of second in succession construction of 'TPS-2' in Dushanbe 2. Some sources suggest that major delays took place after Tajikistan contracted this loan on July 4, 2009. The ceremony for the beginning of Phase 1 was on September 8, 2009, but construction did not begin in earnest until 2012. 3. On January 30, 2014, the Tajik Minister of Energy and Water Resources Usmonali Usmonov said at a news conference that ‘China’s Xinjiang Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock Co. Ltd (TBEA) has agreed to construct the plant at these terms […]. TBEA has taken a 179 million USD loan from the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank) at its own risk for construction of the plant.’ Also, in a company note, TBEA announced that it would cover the costs of Phase 1 in return for the rights to explore and develop three (rather than two) gold deposits in Ayni district of Sughd province. This issue warrants further investigation. 4. It is important to note that the Economic and Commercial Office of the Chinese Embassy reported in 2009 that TBEA was to receive mining rights in return for the project, before the ‘resources-for-infrastructure’ deal took place.","# Sector

China Development Bank provides $15 million loan for Phase 1 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#46211, #54106, #71137, #91801)

# Description
On July 4, 2009, the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank) and China Development Bank (CDB) signed $30 million loan agreement with the Ministry of Energy and Industry of Tajikistan for Phase 1 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. Project ID#54106 captures the $15 million contribution from China Eximbank and Project ID#71101 captures the $15 million contribution from CDB. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown.   Then, in 2012, TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC (特变电工杜尚别矿业有限 or 特变电工杜尚别矿业有限公司 or ТВЕА Душанбе горная промышленность) — a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of TBEA — signed a $179 million loan agreement with China Eximbank for the Phase 1 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project (captured via Project ID#91801). The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the loan was part of a trilateral ‘resources-for-infrastructure’ agreement between the Tajik Ministry of Energy, TBEA, and TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC. Under the terms of the ‘resources-for-infrastructure’ agreement, TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC agreed to ‘front’ $179 million for the construction of Phase 1 by borrowing directly from China Eximbank, and, in turn, the Tajik Government agreed to grant TBEA exclusive rights to explore and develop gold deposits at the Eastern Duoba mine and the Upper Kumarg mine (until TBEA could recoup its investment). The Tajik Government also reportedly agreed to give TBEA the rights to further mining deposits (at an unidentified location) if the profit made from the gold deposits at the Eastern Duoba mine and the Upper Kumarg mine did not cover the cost of Phase 1 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. Also, as part of the ‘resources-for-infrastructure’ agreement, TBEA was reportedly exempted from paying customs duties and value added tax (VAT) on imported equipment necessary for exploration and development of the deposits. The tax and customs exemptions were scheduled to cease once TBEA recouped its initial costs. However, the agreement allowed TBEA to continue to mine the gold deposits for profit after the expiration of the exemptions.   Then, on November 7, 2014, the the Government of Tajikistan and the Export-Import Bank of China signed two loan agreements — a RMB 929,977,078 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2014) 30 TOTAL NO. (553)] and a $178,969,220 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2014) 40 TOTAL NO. (34)] for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. The GCL is captured via Project ID#46211 and the PBC is captured via Project ID#71137. Both of these loans were ratified by the Tajik Parliament on January 14, 2015. The GCL was contracted by the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and it carried the following borrowing terms: a 25 year maturity, an 11 year grace period, and a 1.5% interest rate. The PBC carries a 20 year maturity, a 9 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The Government of Tajikistan contributed $17,443,400 of counterpart financing. In total, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan contracted $331,058,220 of China Eximbank debt for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. The Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds of the GCL and the PBC to on-lend to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) “Barqi Tojik”. OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy. The subsidiary GCL agreement (#TАJ 2014-028-2) was signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” on December 18, 2014. It carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 25 years. Its final maturity date was set to August 21, 2039. The subsidiary PBC agreement (#TАJ 2014-028-1) was also signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” on December 18, 2014 and it carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 20 years. Its final maturity date was set to June 21, 2034.   Dushanbe 2 is a combined heat and power plant (CHP) — also known as the Dushanbe-2 Thermal Power Plant (TPS-2) — that provides heat and electricity for the residents of Dushanbe. It only operates in the winter. The 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project was designed and implemented in two phases. The power plant was to be fueled by coal, with the potential to switch to gas. Phase 1 (mainly constructed between 2012-2014) installed a capacity of 100 MW, while Phase 2 (constructed between 2014-2016) installed an additional capacity of 300 MW. TBEA was the general contractor responsible for implementation of both phases. Henan No 1 Thermal Power Construction Company was also involved in the implementation of Phase 1.
