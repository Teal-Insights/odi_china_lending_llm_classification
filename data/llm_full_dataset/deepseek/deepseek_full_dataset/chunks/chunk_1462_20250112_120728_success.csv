CDB contributes $131 million to $261.8 million syndicated loan for 630MW Rembang Power Plant Construction Project

# Description
On December 3, 2008, Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) — an Indonesian state electricity distribution company — signed a $261.8 million syndicated loan agreement with China Development Bank (CDB) and Barclays plc (a British multinational investment bank and financial services company) for the 630MW Rembang Power Plant Construction Project. CDB contributed $131 million. The loan carried the following terms: a 13-year maturity, a 3 year grace period, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (2.178% in December 2008) plus a 3.25% margin. The loan’s final maturity date was December 3, 2021. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the $338.8 million cost of an EPC contract between PLN and a consortium [consisting of Zelan Holdings (M) Sdn Bhd (Zelan), PT Prinamaya Djan International, and Tronoh], which was signed on March 21, 2007.   The purpose of the project was to install a 630-megawatt (MW) coal-fired power plant — with two 315MW generators (Unit 1 and Unit 2) — in Taharang Village, East of Rembang City, Central Java Province (exact locational coordinates: -6.636, 111.4749).   The Zelan-Primanaya-Tronoh consortium was the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. However, it subcontracted Dongfang Electric Corporation to provide the power generators. A project commencement (pole erection) ceremony took place on September 19, 2007 and the project was originally expected to reach completion in December 2009. However, the project encountered significant implementation delays. Unit 1 ultimately reached its commercial operations date (COD) on October 26, 2011 and Unit 2 reached its COD on January 25, 2012.   Dongfang Electric Corporation and Zelan later entered litigation over a payment dispute.

However, Dongfang Electric Corporation reportedly did not fulfill its obligations under the contract (due to an earthquake in China that damaged some of the facilities of Dongfang Electric Corporation, thereby activating the EPC contract’s force majeure clause). Then, on November 21, 2008, China Huadian Engineering Co. Ltd and PT Tanjung Kasam Power (or “TK Power” or “PT TJK Power”) signed an EPC contract and a $150 million supplier credit agreement for the 130MW Tanjung Kasam Power Plant Construction Project. PT Tanjung Kasam Power is 90% owned by PT Petra Unggul Sejahtera and 10% owned by PT PLN Batam. The proceeds from the supplier credit were to be used by the borrower (PT Tanjung Kasam Power) to partially finance the $181 million cost of the EPC contract with China Huadian Engineering Co. Ltd. The borrowing terms of the supplier credit were as follows: a 10-year maturity and a 3 year grace period. The interest rate of the supplier credit is unknown. It is known that the borrower purchased credit insurance from Sinosure. China Huadian Engineering Co.

China Huadian Engineering Co. Ltd was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. On August 31, 2010, a formal groundbreaking ceremony was held.  However, construction did not begin until March 1, 2011. The expected duration of the construction period was 28 months. However, the project was completed in 20 months (well ahead of schedule).
