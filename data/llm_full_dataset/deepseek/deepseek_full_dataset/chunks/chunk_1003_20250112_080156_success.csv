For the time being, AidData has coded the identity of the financier as an Unspecified Chinese Government Institution. However, this issue requires further investigation. 3. Under most EPC+F contractual arrangements, a loan is extended to the EPC contractor but with a sovereign guarantee from the host government. Therefore, AidData assumes that the loan issued to CHEC is backed by a repayment guarantee from the Government of Iran (i.e. a sovereign guarantee). 4. AidData has estimated the face value of the loan by taking 85% of the value of the EUR 118 million EPC+F contract.","# Sector
