# Description
On March 31, 2015, Star Bulk Carriers Corp., a shipping company organized under the laws of the Republic of Marshall Islands, entered into an agreement with DNB Bank ASA as facility agent, security agent account bank, and book runner, DNB Bank ASA and the Export-Import Bank of China (CEXIM) as mandated lead arrangers and DNB Bank ASA, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (SEB) and CEXIM as original lenders for up to $227.5 million to partially finance the construction cost of seven new building vessels, Gargantua (ex-HN166), Goliath (ex-HN167), Maharaj (ex-HN184), Star Poseidon (ex-HN198), Star Aries (ex-HN1338), Star Taurus (ex-HN1339), and Star Eleni (HN1342). The financing is available in seven separate tranches, one for each new vessel. Project ID#66250 records all seven tranches and total official sector Chinese lending commitments.  As a result of the sale of the Star Aries and the Star Taurus, Star Bulk Carriers Corp. decided not to draw down on two tranches under this facility. The first tranche of $32.4 million and the second and third tranches of $30.3 million each were drawn upon the delivery of the vessels Gargantua on April 15, 2015, and Goliath and Maharaj on July 15, 2015. The fourth tranche of $23.4 million was drawn, upon the delivery of the vessel Star Poseidon on February 16, 2016.  On June 29, 2015, Star Bulks signed a supplemental letter with the lenders under this facility to amend certain covenants governing this facility until December 31, 2016, that as a result of the sale of the Star Aries on February 29, 2016, and that of the Star Taurus on April 16, 2016, the lenders will not draw down on the fifth and the sixth tranches under this facility. In 2017 the recipient canceled the loan commitment for Star Eleni, the seventh tranche, that on January 3, 2018, the recipient took delivery of the Newcastlemax vessels Star Eleni (ex HN 1342) which was financed under bareboat leases with CSSC.  The tranches are repayable in 24 quarterly consecutive installments ranging between $0.4 million and $0.5 million, with the first becoming due and payable three months from the draw-down date of each tranche and a final balloon installment for each tranche, ranging between $14.6 million and $20.2 million payable simultaneously with the 24th installment. The DNB–SEB–CEXIM $227.5 million Facility was secured by a first priority cross-collateralized mortgage over the financed vessels and general and specific assignments and is guaranteed by Star Bulk Carriers Corp. The delivery installments of $113,046 in aggregate for the respective vessels were partially financed by $93,000 drawn down under the DNB-SEB-CEXIM $227,500 Facility.  On September 27, 2018, Star Bulks entered into a loan agreement with DNB Bank ASA for a loan of $310.0 million, a tranche of $240 million of which refinanced all amounts outstanding under multiple facilities including the DNB-SEB-CEXIM $227.5 million facility. The $240 million was drawn on September 28, 2018, and will be repayable in 20 equal quarterly installments of $8.7 million and a balloon payment along with the last installment in an amount of $66.1 million. The tranche of $70 million will be repayable in 12 quarterly installments, each being equal to 5.55% of that tranche and the remaining balance will be repaid in the form of a balloon installment at the final repayment date.",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,General Infrastructure,"Project involves financing for construction of vessels, which does not have a clear environmental or energy transition impact","Financing for construction of seven new vessels, no specific environmental or energy transition focus mentioned"

The loan by China EXIM Bank is divided into three tranches, A, B, and C, worth $25,500,000 for each vessel: vessel A, the 180,000 dwt capesize bulk carrier m.v. 'SBI PURO' (tranche A); vessel B (H1310) (tranche B); and vessel C (H1311) (tranche C). SBI Puro Shipping Company is receiving vessel A, SBI Valrico Shipping Company Limited is receiving vessel B, and SBI Maduro Shipping Company Limited is receiving vessel C.  For Tranche B, $25,500,000 for H1310, half of which, $12,750,000, was committed by China EXIM Bank and was disbursed before the facility was cancelled. This project records the amount disbursed by China Exim Bank before the facility was cancelled.   According to section 5.3.4 of '$76,500,000 Secured Loan Agreement', the amount of each lender's participation in any tranche will be equal to the proportion borne by its commitment to the total commitments, so the proportion of involvement of China EXIM Bank in each tranche is 50%. The amount of each tranche is $25,500,000 and China EXIM Bank provides accordingly $12,750,000.  The interest rate is calculated as LIBOR rate (0.528% as the average of 6 months in October 2015) + margin (2.5%) = 3.028%. The first installment in respect of Tranche B falls due on the 21st day of the last month of the next financial quarter, thus the grace period for each tranche is 3 months. The maturity date for tranche B is the date falling ten years after the delivery date of H1310, which was planned in 2015, thus the maturity date was planned to be in 2025.  During November 2015, Scorpio Bulkers Inc. drew down $25,500,000 relating to the delivery of one of the vessels, SBI Valrico. Pursuant to the three vessels collateralizing this facility being classified as held-for-sale in November 2015, this facility was canceled in December 2015 and the $25,500,000 was repaid. Because of China Eximbank's 50% commitment to each tranche, $12,750,000 was disbursed by China Eximbank before the facility was cancelled. A Capesize vessel named SBI Valrico was delivered from Shanghai Waigaoqiao Shipbuilding Co., Ltd. between July 1, 2015 and October 29, 2015 while there was no record of vessel delivery of SBI Puro nor SBI Maduro. Therefore, the drawn down and repaid $12,750,000 is identified with tranche B.","Scorpio Bulkers Inc. is a company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.  Scorpio Bulkers Inc. is a company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.AidData assumes that this project was financed by an export buyer's credit (buyer’s credit loan) as the flow is denominated in USD and it is insured with Sinosure's buyer's credit insurance.This project is linked to projects #62839, #62841, #62771, which record the three tranches which have been cancelled.","# Sector
