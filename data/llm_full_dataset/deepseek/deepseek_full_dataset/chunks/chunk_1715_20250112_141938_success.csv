The agreement was signed by Liu Jun, general manager of AVIC Beijing, Hu Keyi, chief engineer of Jiangnan Shipyard, and AFKHAMI, president of IRISL. It appears that CATIC, in turn, secured an export seller’s credit from a Chinese state-owned bank in order to finance the supplier credit.    The proceeds from the supplier credit were to be used by the borrower to finance 80% of the cost of a $84.72 million commercial contract with CATIC. The first carrier was scheduled for delivery in January 2006 with a new carrier being delivered every 3 months thereafter until IRISL received all four carriers. There is evidence that at least several of the carriers were successfully delivered to IRISL. However, precise delivery dates are unavailable.","1.
