The purpose of this project was to construct 160 housing units in the Roche Caiman district. The loan carried the following terms:  4% interest rate, 8-year maturity, and 3-year grace period. Loan repayments were to be made between 2000 and 2005. Total disbursements through this loan amounted to RMB 49,282,473. Then, on August 29, 2000, China Eximbank and the Government of Seychelles signed an agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO.8A (97) 1997] to reschedule the repayment terms of this loan.

Then, in August 2008, the Government of Seychelles made one principal payment of RMB 683,966 ($100,000) to China Eximbank. However, due to economic difficulties, the Government of Seychelles had difficulty servicing the loan even after the 2000, 2003, 2004, and 2006 reschedulings.
