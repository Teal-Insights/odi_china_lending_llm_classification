Of that aggregate amount, RMB 50 million ($7 million) was forgiven on 27 December 2007 (see Project #34749) and the remaining RMB 17.38 million ($3 million) was cancelled between late 2007 and early 2009.","The loans forgiven through this action were almost certainly interest-free loans committed through previous ETCAs. As such, the loans likely had maturity lengths of 20 years and since they had reached maturity no later than 2009, they were almost certainly contracted prior to 2000. Therefore, AidData has not has not assigned this record to the umbrella category (as there is little risk of double counting the monetary value of the debts that were forgiven).","# Sector
