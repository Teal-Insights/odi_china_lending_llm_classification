85336,BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES,[China Co-Financing Fund] IDB administers $50 million loan from CHC for Financial System Reform Support Program II,"On August 15, 2017, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) signed two loan contracts with the Government of Colombia for the Financial System Reform Support Program II: a $400 million loan that IDB issued from its ordinary capital (Loan 4074/OC-CO), and a $50 million loan from the People's Bank of China (Loan 4074/CH-CO) via the China Co-Financing Fund for Latin America and the Caribbean (CHC). The $450 million of loan financing authorized by IDB was designed to cover the total project cost.  The CHC loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 5.5-year (66-month) grace period, a 0.5% commitment (credit) fee, no management fee, and an annual interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 0.1% funding margin (also known as the ‘Bank’s Cost of Funding’) and a 0.85% IDB lending spread.   This program included several components intended to increase the financial system's contribution to Colombia's growth: (1) enhancement of financing for productive development (particularly in the agricultural sector) and public-private partnerships through strengthening of public institutions and guarantee systems; (2) improving the regulation and monitoring process of the financial system to support the development of the capital markets and financial transparency; and (3) increasing financial inclusion for those without bank accounts by improving the volume, quality, opportunity, and access to financial services for the population. The program also sought to improve access to financing for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). Portions of the program, such as financial system transparency and development capital markets, were specifically aimed at meeting requirements to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).  Colombia's Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (Ministerio de Hacienda y Crédito Público) and the National Planning Department (Departamento Nacional de Planeación) were responsible for project execution. The final loan disbursement took place on August 29, 2017. This project has reached completion; however, its precise implementation start and end dates are unknown.","1.

AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate (2.25%) by adding average 3-month LIBOR in the third quarter of 2017 (1.3%) to the funding margin during the third quarter of 2017 (0.1%) and the IDB lending spread during the third quarter of 2017 (0.85%). 3. According to the CHC loan contract, the ‘Bank's Cost of Funding’ means a cost margin calculated quarterly relative to a three (3)-month LIBOR Dollar Interest Rate, using the weighted average cost of funding instruments applicable to the Flexible Financing Facility, expressed in terms of an annual percentage, as determined by the Bank.

Under the terms of this agreement, the Chinese Government reportedly cancelled 630 million Comorian francs (KMF) of the Government of Comoros’ outstanding debt obligations. The debt exemption arrangement was part of a Chinese Government initiative to boost economic growth in Comoros and lighten it debt burden to catalyze future projects like the rehabilitation of The People's Palace of Comoros.","The loans forgiven through this action were almost certainly interest-free loans committed through previous ETCAs. As such, the loans likely had maturity lengths of 20 years and since they had reached maturity no later than 2017, they were almost certainly contracted prior to 2000.
