This framework agreement (captured in Project ID#60219) was ratified on October 26, 2006.   One of the subsidiary loans that was approved through the framework agreement was a $62,310,857.20 loan in 2014 for the Mpila Shopping Center Construction Project. The loan carried a 14-year maturity and a 0.25% interest rate. Its estimated grace period was 4 years. The loan’s (principal) amount outstanding was $51,900,548 as of December 31, 2019.  The project involved the construction of a shopping center in the Mpila neighborhood within the capital city of Brazzaville.   It was part of a larger Chinese Government-funded effort to rebuild parts of Brazzaville that were destroyed by a deadly March 2012 blast at a munition’s depot in the Mpila neighborhood within the capital city of Brazzaville. China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) and China Jiangsu International Economic Technical Cooperation Corporation were the contractors responsible for implementation.

In the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020, it identifies a $502 million China Eximbank loan for the ‘Brazzaville Mall’ Project and a $62 million loan for the ‘Mpila Business District’ Project. It does not record borrowing terms for either loan. AidData has not identified any official sources that confirm the existence of a $502 million China Eximbank loan. However, the Republic of Congo’s Public Debt Agency (Caisse Congolaise d’Amortissement or CCA) and Délégation Générale des Grands Travaux (DGGT) does identify an RMB 400,000,000 ($62,310,857,20) loan — with the maturity length of 14 years — for the Mpila Shopping Center Construction Project. AidData records this loan. 3. According to a 2019 report published by the Republic of Congo’s National Assembly, all loans approved under the June 19, 2006 framework agreement had an interest rate of 0.25% and grace periods between 3 and 5 years. Therefore, since the grace period of the China Eximbank loan for the Mpila Shopping Center Construction Project is missing, AidData imputes a value (4 years) at the middle of the distribution of this range as an approximation. 4. A China Eximbank source indicates that $410 million was provided for the construction of Mpila Memorial Construction Project, the Mpila Shopping Center Construction Project, and the Brazzaville Commercial Center (Mpila Twin Towers) Construction Project.
