CNPC holds a 60% ownership stake, and the Government of Niger holds a 40% ownership stake in SORAZ. To finance Phase 1 of the Agadem Oil Project, CNPC borrowed $880 million from China Eximbank in 2008 on the following terms: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 350 basis points, a maturity of 11 years (estimated final maturity date: September 2, 2019), and a 1 year grace period. CNPC then used the proceeds of this loan to on-lend to Société de Raffinage de Zinder (SORAZ). The Government of Niger provided a sovereign guarantee for its 40 percent share of the SORAZ loan (equivalent to $352 million) on September 2, 2008. As of 2021, the loan had achieved a 93.1% disbursement rate ($819,587,514 out of $880,000,000).  Phase 1 of this project involved the construction of the Soraz oil refinery in the village and rural commune of Ollelewa within Tanout Department and Zinder Region.

These audits, according to the IMF, revealed “inflated and undocumented costs” in the case of the oil fields, and “reasonable costs but significant space to improve efficiency” for the SORAZ refinery. The Nigerien authorities also kept the price of gasoline in Niger artificially low, which hurt the refinery’s bottom line.

89448,BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES,CBN makes RMB 669.66 million drawdown under currency swap agreement with PBOC in 2018,"On April 27, 2018, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) signed an RMB 15 billion, three-year bilateral currency swap agreement to facilitate trade and improve foreign currency liquidity in Nigeria. Then, during 2018, the CBN made drawdowns (via 12 bi-weekly auctions) under the currency swap agreement equivalent to RMB 669.66 million. During 2019, the CBN made drawdowns (via 26 bi-weekly auctions) under the currency swap agreement equivalent to RMB 782.66 million. During 2020, the CBN made drawdowns (via 26 bi-weekly auctions) under the currency swap agreement equivalent to RMB 1,017,140,000.   Between January and June 2021, the CBN made drawdowns (via 13 bi-weekly auctions) under the currency swap agreement equivalent to RMB 1,217,090,000. These borrowings carried unknown maturity lengths and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin.","1. A bilateral currency swap (BCS) agreement — also known as a central bank liquidity swap agreement — is an agreement between the central banks of two countries to exchange cash flows in different currencies at predetermined rates over a specified period of time. Central banks participate in these agreements to facilitate bilateral trade settlements using their national currencies (rather than relying upon on a third-party currency such as the U.S. dollar), manage demands from their local banks, and provide liquidity support to financial markets. The party that draws down on the swap line becomes the borrower and the other party becomes lender. During the term of the swap, the party that draws down on the swap line makes either fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amount. If both parties draw down on the swap line, then both parties exchange fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amounts. The 5-step process of drawing upon a currency swap line with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) can described from the perspective of an importer in a given country (‘Country X’) seeking to settle trade with a Chinese firm in RMB. Step 1: The central bank of Country X and the PBOC activate their currency swap in advance, at which point each party deposits a specific amount of its currency in an account controlled by the other party (i.e. the central bank of Country X deposits local currency in an account controlled by the PBOC, and the PBOC deposits an equivalent amount in RMB in an account controlled by the central bank of Country X). Step 2: A firm in Country X that imports goods from China applies for an RMB-denominated loan from a domestic bank. Step 3: The domestic bank in Country X that receives the loan application then applies to its central bank for an RMB-denominated loan. After a review process, the central bank of Country X notifies the domestic bank applicant that its loan application was approved. The central bank of Country X subsequently requests that the PBOC transfer RMB funds from the central bank of Country X’s swap account within the PBOC to the loan applicant’s account with a corresponding bank in China. Step 4:  The domestic bank in Country X directs the corresponding bank in China to transfer RMB funds into a Chinese exporter’s account, and the corresponding bank in China provides RMB funds to the Chinese exporter. Step 5: The importer in Country X repays the RMB-denominated loan at its maturity date. The domestic bank notifies the central bank of Country X of the repayment and transfers RMB into the central bank’s account within the PBOC through the corresponding bank in China. For the central bank of Country X, the RMB deposit is an asset that should be recorded on its balance sheet as an official reserve asset denominated in RMB. The contra entry of this asset is the liability in the local currency of Country X that represents China’s claims in the central bank of Country X. This should be also recorded on the balance sheet of the central bank of Country X. At the time of the exchange of currencies, it should be recorded as an increase in assets and an increase in liabilities of the monetary authorities in the balance of payments. The reason why the PBOC uses this mechanism to provide renminbi liquidity to other central bank is to increase the speed, convenience, and volume of transactions between the two countries. More detailed information about currency swaps with the PBOC can be found at https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021210-print-pdf.ashx and https://thechinaguys.com/the-rise-of-the-renminbi-the-reality-of-bilateral-swap-agreements/ and https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2017/pdf/17-25a.pdf. 2. AidData treats drawdowns under BCS agreements with the PBOC as collateralized loans because, in a BCS arrangement, the currency of the borrower is held as collateral while the lender receives interest on the amount drawn down by the borrower until repayment is made.3. Most central banks publish their end-of-year outstanding PBOC swap debt, but only a few report detailed transaction-level data on drawdowns during the year. Therefore, if no information on drawings is available, AidData assumes that total drawdowns during the reporting period equal the amount outstanding at the end of the reporting period (and vice versa). Since the (de jure) maturities of PBOC swap drawings are 12 months or less, this creates a lower bound estimate for actual drawdowns under the PBOC swap line.  4. PBOC swap debt is frequently rolled over. In central bank reports where one can only observe the year-end outstanding amount, no distinction between rollovers and drawdowns is possible. In these cases, one can derive (new) drawdowns as the difference between the current and last year’s outstanding swap debt stock. This measure essentially captures net lending through the PBOC swap line.","# Sector

This loan has a 5 year maturity. CNG (Nigeria) Investment Ltd also provided equity investment and a non-shareholder loan for this project. On December 21, 2017, and May 10, 2018, the World Bank Group’s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) agreed to issue guarantees of up to $30,452,058 to China Development Bank (CDB) of China and of up to $41,360,000 to CNG (Nigeria) Investment Ltd. (CGIL) of Hong Kong, respectively, for their non-shareholder loans, shareholder loans and equity investments into CNG Glass (Nigeria) FZE in Nigeria. The guarantees were issued for up to five years for the shareholder and non-shareholder loans, and for up to ten years for the equity investment against the risks of Expropriation, Transfer Restriction, and War and Civil Disturbance. Beijing Qinchang Glass Co., Ltd.（北京秦昌玻璃有限 公司), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the CGHL, also agreed to provide mortgage over its legally owned industrial property and apartment, to the CDB for the liabilities of the borrower [CNG Glass (Nigeria) FZE] under the loan agreement.  The Float Glass Plant Construction Project involves the design, construction and operation of a float glass manufacturing plant with a capacity of 500 tons per day (tpd) in Nigeria’s Ogun Guangdong Free Trade Zone, about 30-km from Lagos. The project will require an area of approximately 250,000 m2, and will include construction of a raw material storage warehouse and batching; float glass combined workshop; finished products warehouse; cooling water circulation system; protective gas preparation system; furnace and chimney; and offices and worker accommodation. The production process consists of charging the raw materials required to make clear or colored glass through weighing, mixing and conveying to the furnace which produces molten glass. The molten glass then passes into a bath of molten tin where the temperature is gradually reduced and the glass sheets can be pulled off the bath by rollers. Variation in the flow speed and roller speed enables glass sheets of varying thickness to be formed. This is followed by annealing, cutting and loading.  The project will also include construction of a natural gas power generating system (installed capacity 6 MW) and a back-up diesel generating system (installed capacity 6 MW). Natural gas will be supplied by the local natural gas company via a pipeline, which has already been constructed to supply the Ogun Guangdong Free Trade Zone (see Project ID#52477). Diesel will be brought to site via truck.  The project is located within the OGFTZ located in the Igbessa Region of Ogun State. The zone opened in 2009 as a partnership between the Ogun Statement Government and the Guangdong Provincial Government in China. A total of 10,000 ha has been allocated for the zone, but thus far, only 250 ha has been developed (i.e. land prepared and fully fenced). As of March 2016, 27 companies were operating within the zone and an additional 14 have committed investments. Raw materials for the glass production, including silica sand, dolomite, feldspar, limestone, glauber salt and coal powder, will be sourced domestically. Soda ash will import from overseas. Raw materials will be transported via powder truck by a licensed contractor. Both raw materials and the final product will be transported by existing roads.

60921,"AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY, FISHING",ICBC contributes $80 million to syndicated loan for Indorama Eleme Fertilizer Line 2 Expansion Project,"On June 12, 2018, Indorama Eleme Fertilizers & Chemicals Limited -- a special purpose vehicle that is legally incorporated in Nigeria and a subsidiary of Indorama Corporation (Singapore) -- signed a $1 billion syndicated loan agreement for Phase II of the Indorama Eleme Fertilizer Line 2 Expansion Project.  The deal was put together in challenging conditions for the Nigerian market, but it was well structured and had the backing of revenues from the first fertilizer line financed in 2013 (which was also awarded The African Petrochemical Deal of 2013 by PFI). ICBC appears to have been a late add to the syndicate, as when it was originally announced, the loan was lead managed by IFC, which directly lent $100 million (as well as under its managed co-lending portfolio program) together with equally large participations by joint mandated lead arrangers and lenders -- European Investment Bank, Yes Bank, CDC Group, African Development Bank, Bank of Baroda and Standard Bank. In addition, Standard Chartered, Bangkok Bank, FMO, DEG, Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund, Proparco, ICICI Bank and Citibank also participated in the deal. ICBC reportedly contributed $80 million to the syndicated loan for the Indorama Eleme Fertilizer Line 2 Expansion Project.   No MIGA cover or partial risk guarantee were required. The tenor on the debt was 11 years door-to-door for DFIs and 8 years for commercial banks with a four-year principal grace period.  The Indorama Eleme Fertilizer Plant which began operation in May 2016 is located on Indorama Eleme Petrochemicals Limited (IPL) site in Port Harcourt, River State and produces 1.4 million MTPA of urea fertilizer. The Indorama Eleme Fertilizer Line 2 Expansion Project consists of the expansion of IFL’s existing fertilizer complex in Port Harcourt, Nigeria from 1.4 to 2.8 million TPA by adding a new and identical train to the existing fertilizer plant. The new fertilizer plant (Line II) will consist of (i) Ammonia unit with a single train of 2,300 metric tons per day (MTPD); (ii) Urea unit with a single train of 4,000 MTPD granular urea; (iii) Urea granulation unit with a single train of 4,000 MTPD design capacity; (iv) Additional small urea granulation unit of 800 MTPD design capacity and (v) Inside boundary infrastructure, utilities and storage facilities.   Construction of the second fertilizer line began in April 2018. The second line of ammonia-urea plant and its associated facilities was successfully completed and commissioned in April 2021.   The project was categorized as 'category one' project by Nigeria's Federal Ministry of Environment (FMEnv), which confirmed the need to conduct a full blown ESIA. An ESIA for the project was subsequently carried out in line with national legislation. The ESIA process conformed to the AfDB’s ESAP. An ESMP was also adopted.   In April 2018 a complaint was filed with the  Office of the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO) by 134 IEFCL employees raising a series of concerns regarding the company’s labor and working conditions and use of security forces. Specifically, these concerns pertain to: (a) salaries/welfare; (b) discrimination; (c) unionization; (d) tax calculation and union dues withholdings; (e) discipline and treatment of employees who complained to CAO and/or who criticize management; (f) workplace safety, hazards, and hazard allowance; (g) healthcare coverage; and, (h) impacts associated with a July 2017 protest. CAO found the complaint eligible for further assessment in May 2018. The CAO team conducted an assessment trip in September 2018. During CAO’s assessment, there was a lack of consensus amongst the parties to engage in a CAO facilitated dispute resolution process. In accordance with CAO’s Operational Guidelines, the complaint has been referred to CAO’s compliance function. In December 2019, CAO completed a compliance appraisal of the case. While the range of issues raised by the complainants are potentially serious, enhanced supervision by IFC subsequent to the July 2017 protest has considered the company’s approach to labor issues and security. Where gaps against Performance Standard requirements were identified, IFC documented implementation of corrective actions. However, while IFC supervision provides general assurance of the company’s PS2 performance, questions remain as to IFC’s response to allegations that the company has taken a retaliatory approach to workers who have raised grievances with the company. CAO concludes that this issue raises substantial concern regarding the application of PS2 to IFC’s investments and requires further investigation by CAO. CAO’s investigation will be limited in scope to IFC’s review and supervision of the company’s disciplinary procedures and approach to grievance handling, including its response to the specific grievances raised in the complaint.  In June 2021, CAO finalized the compliance investigation in relation to the case, making two non-compliance findings in relation to IFC’s supervision of the environmental and social (E&S) risks and impacts of the project.  The investigation report was sent to IFC for formal response.  CAO’s investigation concluded that, while IFC enhanced its supervision of the Company’s WGM since 2018 and documented improvements, IFC supervision activities do not provide sufficient evidence of the effectiveness of the Company’s WGM regarding PS2 requirements. Particularly, IFC lacks assurance that the Company is implementing a WGM which provides workers with a channel to address their concerns in a manner that is perceived as safe and fair. The investigation also concluded that IFC’s response to the complainant's allegations of Company retaliation against workers was insufficient and represents a non-compliance with the Performance Standard 2 requirement to ensure the right of workers to organize and raise grievances without fear of reprisal. An appropriate IFC response would have included actions aimed at further understanding and assessing the situation, such as: engaging with workers alleging instances of reprisals to review their claims and concerns, and/or a more in-depth review of whether the company’s WGM was effective and whether disciplinary procedures had been properly applied. CAO concluded that the lack of guidance at the IFC and client level on handling allegations of retaliation at the time was an underlying cause of this non-compliance finding. Finally, CAO also concluded that available evidence, in this case, is insufficient to make findings of adverse outcomes in relation to the complainants’ allegations of retaliation. CAO’s investigation report and IFC’s response, which included a Management Action Plan (MAP), were cleared for publication by the IFC Board of Directors on September 16, 2021. The first Management Progress Report on the Implementation of the Management Action Plan was published on October 26, 2022.","1.

ICBC contributes $80 million to syndicated loan for Indorama Eleme Fertilizer Line 2 Expansion Project

# Description
On June 12, 2018, Indorama Eleme Fertilizers & Chemicals Limited -- a special purpose vehicle that is legally incorporated in Nigeria and a subsidiary of Indorama Corporation (Singapore) -- signed a $1 billion syndicated loan agreement for Phase II of the Indorama Eleme Fertilizer Line 2 Expansion Project.  The deal was put together in challenging conditions for the Nigerian market, but it was well structured and had the backing of revenues from the first fertilizer line financed in 2013 (which was also awarded The African Petrochemical Deal of 2013 by PFI). ICBC appears to have been a late add to the syndicate, as when it was originally announced, the loan was lead managed by IFC, which directly lent $100 million (as well as under its managed co-lending portfolio program) together with equally large participations by joint mandated lead arrangers and lenders -- European Investment Bank, Yes Bank, CDC Group, African Development Bank, Bank of Baroda and Standard Bank. In addition, Standard Chartered, Bangkok Bank, FMO, DEG, Emerging Africa Infrastructure Fund, Proparco, ICICI Bank and Citibank also participated in the deal. ICBC reportedly contributed $80 million to the syndicated loan for the Indorama Eleme Fertilizer Line 2 Expansion Project.   No MIGA cover or partial risk guarantee were required. The tenor on the debt was 11 years door-to-door for DFIs and 8 years for commercial banks with a four-year principal grace period.  The Indorama Eleme Fertilizer Plant which began operation in May 2016 is located on Indorama Eleme Petrochemicals Limited (IPL) site in Port Harcourt, River State and produces 1.4 million MTPA of urea fertilizer. The Indorama Eleme Fertilizer Line 2 Expansion Project consists of the expansion of IFL’s existing fertilizer complex in Port Harcourt, Nigeria from 1.4 to 2.8 million TPA by adding a new and identical train to the existing fertilizer plant.

73385,COMMUNICATIONS,China Eximbank provides RMB 2.3 billion government concessional loan for Phase 2 of Nigeria National Information and Communication Technology Infrastructure Backbone (NICTIB) Project (Linked to Project ID#30340),"In November 2006, Galaxy Backbone Limited — a public enterprise of the Federal Government of Nigeria incorporated in 2006 with the primary mandate of setting up and operating a unified Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure platform that addresses the connectivity, transversal and other technology challenges — signed a $117 million commercial contract with Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd for Phase 1 of the Nigeria National Information and Communication Technology Infrastructure Backbone (NICTIB) Project.   Nearly four and a half years later, in May 2011, China Eximbank agreed in principle to provide a $100 million preferential buyer’s credit to finance 85% of the cost of the commercial contract. Then, on January 5, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Nigeria signed a $100,000,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for Phase 1 of the Nigeria National Information and Communication Technology Infrastructure Backbone (NICTIB) Project (captured via Project ID#30340). The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2.5% interest rate. The final maturity date of the loan (PBC) is September 21, 2032. As of December 31, 2020, Nigeria’s Debt Management Office (DMO) reported that the China Eximbank PBC (loan) had achieved a 100% disbursement rate ($100 million) and the borrower had made interest repayments worth $10.66 million and principal repayments worth $3.86 million to the lender. The loan’s (principal) amount outstanding, as of December 31, 2020, was $96.14 million. Under the terms of the PBC agreement, the Government of Nigeria was responsible for paying 15% of the cost of the commercial contract with Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd prior to project implementation.   Advance payment delays by the Government of Nigeria resulted in major project implementation delays. In December 2006, Galaxy Backbone Ltd made an advance payment of $10 million to Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. Then, in December 2013, the Federal Ministry of Finance of Nigeria — on behalf of Galaxy Backbone Limited — paid the remaining balance of the advance payment ($7.65 million) to Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd and officially requested that Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. commence project implementation.   The purpose of Phase 1 of the NICTIB Project was to build a 1482 km nationwide backbone network with fiber optic technology and connect up to 3000 Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) in over 3000 office locations nationwide. The first phase of the project involved the laying of fiber optic cable from Abuja to Onitsha to Lagos, and Onitsha to Port Harcourt to Uyo. More specifically, Phase 1 sought to install fiber optic cable from Abuja – Akwanga – Lafia – Makurdi – Enugu – Awka – Onitisha – Asaba – Benin – ore – Ijebu Ode – Lagos and also link from Onitisha – oweri – PH – Uyo. It also sought to establish Data Centers in Abuja and Metro access systems in cities like Abuja, Makurdi, Enugu and Lagos. Phase 1 was completed on or around August 3, 2018.   Then, on September 5, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Nigeria signed an RMB 2,300,000,000 ($328 million) government concessional loan (GCL) for Phase 2 of the Nigeria National Information and Communication Technology Infrastructure Backbone (NICTIB) Project (captured via Project ID#73385). The borrowing terms of the GCL are as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2.5% interest rate. The final maturity date of the GCL is March 22, 2038.   As of December 31, 2020, Nigeria’s Debt Management Office (DMO) reported that the China Eximbank GCL (loan) had not yet been disbursed and the borrower had not made any interest or principal repayments to the lender. The purpose of Phase 2 is to extend the fiber optic cable network to 19 states in Northern Nigeria. More specifically, the cable is expected to run from Abuja to Plateau, Gombe, Bauchi, Maiduguri, Kano and the rest of Northwestern Nigeria. Upon completion of Phase 2, it is envisaged that the fiber optic cable network will be 3441 km in length.   However, this project has encountered delays and implementation problems. In November 2022, Nigeria’s House of Representatives launched an investigation of the project, including a forensic audit of all relevant transactions to execute Phase 1 and Phase 2. The House of Representatives also urged Galaxy Backbone Limited and Nigeria’s Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning to ‘immediately halt all certificates of completion and payments, respectively, in lieu of the project, pending the completion of the investigation by the committee.’ These resolutions were based on the unanimous adoption of a motion issued by a legislator named Benjamin Bem. At the time, Bem noted that Nigeria’s Galaxy Backbone Limited, which falls under the authority of the Nigerian Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, signed an MoU with Huawei Technology Limited in 2018 to provide fiber infrastructure. He said following the signing of the MoU, Huawei Technology Limited was expected to design, manufacture and deploy a kit that would control data movements across all ministries, departments and agencies in Nigeria (with another loan from China Eximbank).   The lawmaker expressed concerned that ‘Galaxy Backbone Limited […] made claims that the completion of Phase 1 of the project is expected to reap revenue to the tune of billions of naira for the government’ and that ‘whereas there has been no oversight to ascertain the level of the job done [during NICTIB Phase 1] and verify claims of revenue generated by the agency, there is a current bid to access an additional [$328 million loan] to develop the NICTIB Phase II, which covers 19 northern states. He added that ‘[t]he House is [cognizant] of the need to ensure judicious use of the nation’s commonwealth, while ensuring the government’s ICT policy is implemented according to every aspect of statutory provisions guiding the execution of the project.’","1.
