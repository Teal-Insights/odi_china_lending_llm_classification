MUFG (Malaysia) Berhad was wakala investor for both Islamic tranches. The loan comes with no recourse to PEPC’s parent company (Pertamina or guarantees from the Indonesian government.   However, it is collateralized in a de facto sense. It benefits from a trustee borrowing scheme (TBS), which was first developed and employed by Pertamina and its production-sharing contractors in 1984. The TBS is a proven and tested financing structure with a track record of successful implementation in Indonesia for over 30 years. Lenders draw comfort from this well-established structure, without the need for a traditional security package. Under the TBS, loans are repaid by a trustee from an agreed portion of proceeds under identified revenue contracts. Lenders look solely to this source of debt service for payment, with no recourse to the project and no security interest in the project assets or contracts. The trustee (HSBC Bank USA, in the case of the JTB Project) is the borrower under the loan agreements with the lenders, and debt service payments are made from trust accounts or accounts held in the name of the trustee on trust for the lenders and PEPC as the trust beneficiaries, in New York. In the JTB Project, Pertamina as offtaker will pay PEPC’s portion of the gas and condensate revenues to the trust accounts directly. These revenues will be paid by the trustee to the lenders for repayment of principal and interest (or fixed investment return in the case of the Islamic finance tranches). This source of debt service functions as the primary security for the lenders.   The Jambaran Tiung Biru (JTB) Gas Unitization Field Development Project involves the development of proven gas reserves, as well as the construction and operation of a gas processing facility and pipelines. It is located in the unitised Jambaran Tiung Biru field (JTB field) in Bojonegoro Regency, East Java Province, Indonesia. The project is supported by gas sales of up to 192 million standard cubic feet per day under a long-term, fixed-price and fixed-volume take-or-pay gas sales agreement with the offtaker, Pertamina. The development scope covers the drilling of six development wells that will produce 315m standard cubic feet per day of raw gas, the designing and installing of gas processing facilities with a maximum capacity of 330m standard cubic feet per day and the development of gas flow lines from the wells to the gas processing facilities and sales gas pipelines from the gas processing facilities to a gas transmission pipeline. The gas will be channelled through the Gresik-Semarang transmission pipeline – managed by PT Pertamina Gas (Pertagas) – to Central and East Java: the Tambak Lorok Gas and Steam Power Plant (PLTGU) in Central Java and the Java-3 PLTGU in East Java will both be fueled by the project.

(51% equity stake) and Jiangsu Delong Nickel Industry Co., Ltd. (49% equity stake) that was legally incorporated in Indonesia — signed an RMB 6.88 billion ($1.06 billion) facility agreement with a group of Chinese state-owned banks for the Xiamen Xiangyu Integrated Stainless Steel Plant Project.   Participants in the loan syndicate included China Development Bank, China Construction Bank, ICBC, Agricultural Bank of China, CITIC Bank, China Merchants Bank, Bank of China, and Tai Fung Bank. Bank of China served as the mandated lead arranger, financial adviser, onshore and offshore facility agent, and security agent. The facility had a 6.75-year (81-month) maturity. It was provided in three tranches: an RMB-denominated, Sinosure-backed tranche worth $886 million for the ‘offshore’ lenders that carried an interest rate of 5-year LPR plus an unspecified margin; a dual currency, Ping An Insurance-backed tranche for four ‘onshore’ lenders (Tai Fung Bank, Bank of China Jakarta, Bank of China Singapore and ICBC Indonesia) that carried an interest rate of 5-year LPR plus an unspecified margin; and a dual currency, Ping An Insurance-backed tranche for four ‘onshore’ lenders (Tai Fung Bank, Bank of China Jakarta, Bank of China Singapore and ICBC Indonesia) that carried an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus an unspecified margin. The total cost of the Xiamen Xiangyu Integrated Stainless Steel Plant Project is RMB 13.4 billion and it is being financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 51:49.   The purpose of the project is to construct a nickel mine, a 2.5 million metric tons per year stainless steel smelter, a 1,440MW (8X135MW) coal-fired power plant, and a 40 million metric tons multi-functional port in Virtue Dragon Industrial Park in South Sulawesi (exact locational coordinates: -3.827910421, 122.4682708).   Zhongtian Guoneng Power Engineering and Suzhou Thvow Technology. Co., Ltd. are the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. In September 2017, China’s National Development and Reform Commission approved the project. A contract to build the power plant was also awarded to Zhongtian Guoneng Power Engineering in September 2017. The contract specified an implementation period from October 2017 to July 31, 2019. Construction of the smelter began on or around October 2019. In April 2020, the smelter's first production line began to operate. Unit 1 was commissioned in April 2021. Unit 8 began operating in June 2021. Unit 9 began operating in January 2022. However, this project has also become a source of local protest and controversy. Residents living near the Delong Nickel Smelter began to complain about pollution from coal dust almost immediately after the power station began operations. The coal dust reportedly blows up to 3 kilometers away from the power station and coats everything, both indoors and outdoors. Children in the area have also reportedly begun coughing and having difficulty breathing.","1. Pinsent Masons acted as lenders’ legal counsel. Pinsent Masons advised the Bank of China and the financing syndicate. Hermawan Juniarto & Partners and Chang An Law Firm advised the Bank of China on Indonesian and PRC law, respectively. 2. Bank of China served as the security agent for the loan. When lenders take collateral as security for their loans, a collateral/security agent is often appointed to enforce rights against the collateral in the event of the borrower's default under the loan. As such, AidData assumes that the syndicated loan was collateralized. 3. The loans were priced off loan prime rate (LPR), a benchmark lending rate adopted by commercial banks in China. 4. Tai Fung Bank Limited is 50.3% owned by Bank of China. 5. This project is also known as the Delong Nickel Phase II Power Station Project.

This project won the award for Project Finance Deal of the Year at the Asian Legal Business China Law Awards 2021. 7. Clearing conditions precedent on this complex transaction took more than a year. The project ultimately achieved financial close on February 3, 2021, more than a year after the debt financing package was finalized. 8. The monetary values and pricing of the three tranches are unknown. The specific participants in each tranche are also unknown. As such, AidData has created a single record to capture the entire RMB 6.88 billion syndicated loan for the time being.","# Sector

In December 2019, PT Obsidian Stainless Steel — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture between China’s state-owned Xiamen Xiangyu Co., Ltd. (51% equity stake) and Jiangsu Delong Nickel Industry Co., Ltd. (49% equity stake) that was legally incorporated in Indonesia — signed an RMB 6.88 billion ($1.06 billion) facility agreement with a group of Chinese state-owned banks for the Xiamen Xiangyu Integrated Stainless Steel Plant Project.   Participants in the loan syndicate included China Development Bank, China Construction Bank, ICBC, Agricultural Bank of China, CITIC Bank, China Merchants Bank, Bank of China, and Tai Fung Bank. Bank of China served as the mandated lead arranger, financial adviser, onshore and offshore facility agent, and security agent. The facility had a 6.75-year (81-month) maturity. It was provided in three tranches: an RMB-denominated, Sinosure-backed tranche worth $886 million for the ‘offshore’ lenders that carried an interest rate of 5-year LPR plus an unspecified margin; a dual currency, Ping An Insurance-backed tranche for four ‘onshore’ lenders (Tai Fung Bank, Bank of China Jakarta, Bank of China Singapore and ICBC Indonesia) that carried an interest rate of 5-year LPR plus an unspecified margin; and a dual currency, Ping An Insurance-backed tranche for four ‘onshore’ lenders (Tai Fung Bank, Bank of China Jakarta, Bank of China Singapore and ICBC Indonesia) that carried an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus an unspecified margin. The total cost of the Xiamen Xiangyu Integrated Stainless Steel Plant Project is RMB 13.4 billion and it is being financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 51:49.   The purpose of the project is to construct a nickel mine, a 2.5 million metric tons per year stainless steel smelter, a 1,440MW (8X135MW) coal-fired power plant, and a 40 million metric tons multi-functional port in Virtue Dragon Industrial Park in South Sulawesi (exact locational coordinates: -3.827910421, 122.4682708).   Zhongtian Guoneng Power Engineering and Suzhou Thvow Technology. Co., Ltd. are the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. In September 2017, China’s National Development and Reform Commission approved the project. A contract to build the power plant was also awarded to Zhongtian Guoneng Power Engineering in September 2017. The contract specified an implementation period from October 2017 to July 31, 2019. Construction of the smelter began on or around October 2019. In April 2020, the smelter's first production line began to operate. Unit 1 was commissioned in April 2021. Unit 8 began operating in June 2021. Unit 9 began operating in January 2022. However, this project has also become a source of local protest and controversy. Residents living near the Delong Nickel Smelter began to complain about pollution from coal dust almost immediately after the power station began operations. The coal dust reportedly blows up to 3 kilometers away from the power station and coats everything, both indoors and outdoors. Children in the area have also reportedly begun coughing and having difficulty breathing.",TRUE,NA,BROWN,HIGH,Other Energy (Fossil Fuels),Project includes significant coal-fired power generation and industrial smelting operations with documented environmental impacts,"1,440MW coal-fired power plant, stainless steel smelter, documented pollution complaints including coal dust and respiratory issues"
