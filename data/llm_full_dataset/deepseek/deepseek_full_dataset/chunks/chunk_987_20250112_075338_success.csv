The Cuba Standard source says that during Xi Jingping's visit to Havana, China Development Bank chief Hu Huaibang signed an agreement that granted Cuba a loan, amount and conditions undisclosed, for the equipment and construction of three biopesticide plants. Another source claims the loan amount was 60,000,000 euros (See: Empresa Labiofam desarrolla plan de inversiones para fortalecer el sector agropecuario cubano). This project may have been funded by an export buyer's credit loan since the Cuban News Agency source says that the all of the equipment being used in the plant was imported from China using the facility (see 'Cuba keeps working..:'); however, AidData was unable to find record of this transaction in any official sources, so the flow type has been left as Loan (excluding debt rescheduling) for now.","# Sector
