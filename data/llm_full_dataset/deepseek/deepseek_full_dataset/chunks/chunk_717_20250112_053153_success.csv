On October 30, 2017, the Chinese Government and the Government of Seychelles signed an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA), which committed $7.3 million of grant funding for multiple projects (see Project ID#55811).  It was originally announced that the proceeds from the ETCA would be used to facilitate the construction of a new post-secondary school for commerce and visual arts in Anse Royale district, which is located in the southern part of the island of Mahe. However, the Government of Seychelles subsequently earmarked SCR 18 million (about $1.25 million) for the Ile Aurore School Construction Project.   This project will involve the construction of a new school on Aurore Island, which is also known as Ile Aurore. Aurore Island is a man-made island 2 kilometers off the coast of Victoria that the Seychellois plan to turn into a well-off neighborhood; so they must provide schools for families to attend.",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,Social Development,Project focuses on education infrastructure without clear environmental or energy transition impacts,"Construction of new school on Aurore Island, part of social development initiative"
55640,OTHER SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES,Chinese Government provides SCR 25 million grant for Forêt Noire Housing Project,"According to the 2018 Public Sector Investment Programme (PSIP) of the Government of Seychelles, the Chinese Government committed SCR 25,000,000 of grant funding for the Forêt Housing Project in 2017 or 2018. This project involves the redevelopment of the 12-unit Forêt Noire housing complex into a 25-unit affordable housing estate within Port Glaud district. In February 2018, the Seychellois National Tender Board posted the project and a company called Allied Builders won the bid (at a cost of SCR 26,989,246.33). Construction start and end dates are unknown.","This project may be related to the Kan Gard Housing Redevelopment Project (captured in Project ID#55626) because Allied Builders won the bid for both projects and the description of the Kan Gard Housing Redevelopment Project says it may be co-financed by an additional grant. This issue merits further investigation. Also, it is not entirely clear if the 2018 PSIP source is reviewing the previous fiscal year or setting projections for the next fiscal year. For the purposes of this project record, AidData assumes that the 2018 PSIP source was created at the end of the fiscal year 2017 (explained by the 'revised budget 2017' column) and the figures after that column represent how the Government of Seychelles intended to spend the money in the future (during fiscal year 2018). Since fiscal years often do not align with calendar years, and the grant funding from the Chinese Government is classified as ‘new’, it is unclear if the funds were awarded in the calendar year 2017 or calendar year 2018.","# Sector
