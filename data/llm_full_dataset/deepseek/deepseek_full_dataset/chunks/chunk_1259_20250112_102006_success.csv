The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower received a $350 million ‘advance payment’ from the lender and it was allowed to repay the loan with cash or coal from Tavan Tolgoi, which is a coal deposit located in the Ömnögovi Province in southern Mongolia.   When the loan agreement was signed, ETT and Chalco also signed a long-term steelmaking coal supply contract. Under the term of this contract, Chalco agreed to purchase coal from ETT at a price of $70 per ton (well below the $200+ per-ton price of Australian coking coal). In 2012, ETT sold 2.4 million tons of coking coal to Chalco, 3 million tons less than it had originally planned to export. Then, on January 11, 2013, ETT halted coal deliveries to Chalco and announced that it would only supply coal to Chalco if the Chinese state-owned company revised the prices and volumes in the July 2011 supply contract. According to ETT, it was losing $5 on every ton of coal delivered because of rising transportation costs and the price that Chalco was paying for the coal. ETT also claimed that prices were set below the actual cost of extracting and delivering the coal. In March 2013, ETT failed to honor an $86 million loan repayment obligation to Chalco.   Then, in April 2013, ETT agreed to pay a higher interest rate on its total outstanding debt ($186 million) to Chalco as part of an agreement to resume coal deliveries. ETT restarted coal shipments to Chalco on April 22, 2013 after securing a $3 per-ton-of-coal price increase from Chalco. Chalco reportedly agreed to pay $56 per ton and ETT reportedly agreed to supply 5 to 6 million tons of coal to Chalco by the end of 2013. ETT subsequently began to mine Mongolia’s West Tsankhi coal area to ramp up output and expedite the repayment of its outstanding debt to Chalco. In March 2017, ETT announced that the Chalco loan had been repaid in full — partially through coal exports and partially through cash (from the proceeds of a loan that ETT received from from the Mongolian Government).","1. The proceeds of the $350 million Chalco loan were to be used by the borrower as prepayment for coking coal mined from Tavan Tolgoi. As such, the loan that was issued likely came in the form of a pre-export finance (PXF) facility. A PXF facility is an arrangement in which a commodity producer gets up-front cash from a customer in return for a promise to repay the customer with that commodity (possibly at a discount) in the future. PXF funds may be advanced by a lender or syndicate of lenders to a commodity producer to assist the company in meeting either its working capital needs (for example, to cover the purchase of raw materials and costs associated with processing, storage and transport) or its capital investment needs (for example, investment in plant and machinery and other elements of infrastructure). PXF facilities are usually secured by (1) an assignment of rights by the producer under an ‘offtake contract’ (i.e., a sale and purchase contract between the producer and a buyer of that producer of goods or commodities), and (2) a collection account charge over a bank account into which proceeds due to the producer from the buyer of the goods or commodities under the offtake contract are credited. There are two key documents in prepayment finance transactions: a contract providing for the advance payment by the offtaker to the producer for the purchase of goods/commodities (the 'Prepayment Contract'), and a loan agreement between a lender and the offtaker (the 'Offtaker Loan Agreement') under which the advance payment is financed. 2. The maturity field is set to 5.5 years based on the loan signature date and the final loan repayment date. The interest rate field is set to 12% because, in 2015, Mongolia Government Minister M.Enkhsaikhan disclosed that the borrower was repaying its debt to Chalco at a 12% interest rate in 2015. 3. Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi JSC is a project company and special purpose vehicle was founded on August 27, 2010. According to the Resolutions of Mongolian Parliament and Government, Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi JSC started to operate since December 23, 2010 as a subsidiary of Erdenes Mongol LLC to mine the Tavan Tolgoi coal deposit. The main operation of Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi JSC focuses on putting strategic mine deposits into economic activities, carrying out exploitation on the deposits and implementing infrastructure projects. Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi JSC has 588 employees, all of whom are Mongolians. 4. Some sources indicate that the borrower received a $250 million ‘advance payment’ rather than a $350 million ‘advance payment’ from the lender. This issue warrants further investigation.","# Sector

The loan achieved a 99.8% disbursement rate ($99,800,000 out of $99,908,163.60).   The purpose of the project was to reduce air and soil pollution in the city of Ulaanbaatar, construct 2,592 apartments in the 7th and 14th districts (VII and XIV districts) of Ulaanbaatar, install water, wastewater, power, and fiber optic utilities outside the apartments in the 7th district and the MNB district of Ulaanbaatar, and construct a 23.3 km power transmission line to deliver electricity to the 7th district and the MNB district. More specifically, this project supported the construction of 1800 apartments the in “Khangai Khothon” (“Хангай хотхон”) apartment complex within the 7th khoroo of Sukhbaatar district in Ulaanbaatar and the the construction of 792 apartments in the  “Tsagaan Khuaran Khothon” (“Цагаан хуаран хотхон”) apartment complex 14th khoroo of Bayanzurkh district in Ulaanbaatar.   Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co., Ltd (BCEG or Бээжин констракшн инжинеринг групп ХХК) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. As of 2018, all 2592 apartments were constructed and commissioned and all of the utilities outside the apartments in the 7th district were complete. However, at that time, the utilities outside the apartments in the MNB district were only 47.2% complete. According to a project database (http://project.zasag.mn/) maintained by the Government of Mongolia's National Development Department, the project ultimately achieved a 100% completion rate. However, the precise implementation start and end dates of the project are unknown.   This project eventually became a target of internal government scrutiny and criticism. According to an internal audit conducted by the Government of Mongolia, the Ministry of Finance did not adequately record an on-lending arrangement with the Ministry of Construction and Urban Development of Mongolia (MCUD) in its consolidated debt database. The Monitoring, Evaluation and Internal Audit Department of MCUD also found that the project lacked sufficient internal financial controls.","1. This project is also known as the Housing Project.
