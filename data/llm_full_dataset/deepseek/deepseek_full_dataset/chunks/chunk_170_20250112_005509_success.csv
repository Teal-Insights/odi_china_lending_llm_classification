Then, on September 6, 2018, Liu-Yan, President of China National Complete Plant Import Export Corporation (COMPLANT) and Ally Coulibaly, Cote d’Ivoire’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, signed a protocol to mobilize CFA 262 billion (EUR 399.4 million or USD 473.4 million) for the Ferkessédougou Dry Port Construction Project.

According to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the ICBC had not disbursed as of December 31, 2022.  The project is divided into two ‘lots’.

Lot 2 involves the construction of a slaughterhouse, a cattle market, and an industrial zone for the development and processing of agricultural and mining products. The project site is spread over an area of ​​3185 hectares and located in the village of Dékovogo, approximately 5 km from the capital of Tchologo and near the northern city of Ferkessédougou. Upon completion, the dry port of Ferkessédougou is expected to relieve congestion and bring the autonomous port of Abidjan closer to its regional partners such as Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger. It is also expected to make a lasting contribution to the development of the northern regions of the country and to the enhancement of the economic potential of the Poro, Tchologo, and Bagoué regions in Savanes District, and Bounkani, and Gontougo regions in Zanzan district. The project is also expected to generate more than 71,000 direct jobs that will directly benefit young men and women.
