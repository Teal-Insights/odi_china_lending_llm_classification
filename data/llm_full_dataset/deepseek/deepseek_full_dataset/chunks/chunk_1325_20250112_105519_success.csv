The purpose of the project was to supply rolling stock to TUSRC in order to support Tehran Metro Line 1 and Suburban Railway Line 5. In 2010, during project implementation, NORINCO Group had difficulty receiving payments from TUSRC under the EPC contract. In response, China Eximbank and NORINCO Group signed an accounts receivable finance agreement (backed by a short-term, export credit insurance policy from Sinosure), which enabled NORINCO Group to in turn signed a deferred payment agreement with TUSRC worth approximately EUR 43,150,000. China Eximbank and Sinosure later held up the transaction as an example of financial innovation.","1. This project is also known as the Procurement Contract for Vehicles and Spare Parts of Iran Tehran Metro Line 1 and Suburban Railway Line 5 Project and the Iran Rolling Stock Comprehensive Procurement Project. The Chinese project title is 伊朗机车车辆综合采购项目 or 德黑兰综合采购项目 or 伊朗德黑兰地铁1 号线、郊铁5 号线车辆及备件采购合同 or  2 号线和5 号线机车车辆供货项目 or 伊朗德黑兰机车车辆供货项目. 2. In a typical receivables financing agreement (or deferred payment agreement), the company that the project owner in the host country has selected as its engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor is also a lender to the project owner. The company assigns receivables under its EPC contract with the project owner to one of or more banks. Upon assignment of receivables, the bank or banks will release funds to the company so it can discharge its obligations under the receivables financing agreement as a lender. Receivables financing is also known as accounts receivable financing (finance) or A/R financing (finance) or 应收账款融资 (in Chinese). These other terms are used because the accounts receivable of a company (i.e., unpaid invoices) are being used as collateral to unlock working capital—typically in the form of a bank loan (‘receivables loan’). Sellers often face cash flow problems when their buyers do not make full payment at the due date of the invoice. A receivables financing arrangement addresses this problem by allowing them to sell their outstanding invoices to a bank at a discounted rate. This approach allows the seller to receive the remaining invoice amount before the due date of the invoice. The bank either gets its money back at invoice maturity through the seller (acting as a collecting agent) or directly from the debtor. 3. AidData has coded the commitment year as 2010 for the time being because, according to China’s Ministry of Commerce (http://cafiecmofcom.org.cn/article/hyzc/tongjixuehui/201408/20140800695944.shtml), a deferred payment agreement was developed in 2010 by China Eximbank and Sinosure to address the payment difficulties of the project owner (TUSRC). 4. This project reached completion, but its precise completion date is unknown. This issue warrants further investigation. 5. One official source (http://cafiecmofcom.org.cn/article/hyzc/tongjixuehui/201408/20140800695944.shtml) suggests that the maturity of the loan was approximately 1 year.

41364,ACTION RELATING TO DEBT,Chinese Government cancels $6.7 billion of the Government of Iraq’s outstanding debt obligations,"After the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and fall of the Saddam Hussein regime in 2003, the international community, and in particular, the United States, sought to reduce and restructure the Government of Iraq’s outstanding debt obligations to external creditors to facilitate the reconstruction of Iraq. In November 2004, an agreement was reached under the Paris Club framework that provided for an 80% debt relief in net present value (NPV) terms. After this agreement was signed, negotiations with non-Paris Club debt holders (including China) began with the aim of obtaining comparable treatment on the rest of the Iraqi Government’s external debts. The Government of Iraq’s outstanding debts to China represented around $8.5 billion.  Then, on May 3, 2007, the United Nations hosted the Iraqi International Compact Conference — in coordination with the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and regional agencies — to discuss the reconstruction of Iraq. At the conference, which was held in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, Chinese Minister for Foreign Affairs Yang Jiechi announced that the Chinese Government would consider reducing Iraq's outstanding debt obligations; specifically, the Chinese Government was prepared to forgive all the debts owed by the Government of Iraq and would consider Iraq's request for debt reduction and forgiveness according to the arrangement of the Paris Club.  Shortly thereafter, on June 21, 2007, during the President of Iraq Jalal Tabani's state visit to China (the first visit of an Iraqi president to China since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1958) and in the presence of Chinese President Hu Jintao, the Government of the Republic of Iraq and the Government of the People's Republic of China signed a debt exemption protocol (Chinese agreement name: 《中华人民共和国政府和伊拉克共和国政府关于免除伊拉克政府对中国政府债务的议定书》).  However, according to the International Monetary Fund's 2013 Article IV Consultation report on Iraq and several additional sources, the Chinese Government only reduced the Government Iraq's outstanding debt obligations by 80% (eliminating $6.7 billion out of total claims worth $8.5 billion) in 2010, not 2007. The Chinese Government respected the comparability of treatment principle by granting the same amount of debt relief (80% in NPV terms) as other Paris Club creditors. The remaining balance was rescheduled on terms broadly comparable to Paris Club terms. China’s State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC) and the Ministry of Finance of Iraq signed the agreement to cut 80% of Iraq's debt on April 1, 2010. It required approval from China’s State Council and the National People’s Congress. The Government of Iraq’s Ministry of Finance later reported that its outstanding debt obligations to China amounted to $1,534,400,000 in 2014.  Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Shen Guofang reportedly explicitly stated that the Chinese Government forgave the debts incurred during Saddam Hussein's regime for the purpose of gaining access to the bidding processes on oil and infrastructure projects. In November 2008, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) signed a Developing Service Contract with Iraq’s Ministry of Oil and resumed development on the Al-Ahdab Oilfield, a concession that was originally agreed upon in 1997 but idelayed because of U.N. sanctions on Iraq. In 2009, CNPC joined with British Petroleum (BP) to win the operating rights to the Rumaila Oilfield, Iraq's largest oilfield and the sixth largest oilfield in the world with reserves of about 17 billion barrels, and is Iraq’s largest oilfield and the sixth largest oilfield in the world. Also in 2009, CNPC’s joint venture with Total and Petronas won the contract for Halfaya Oilfield in southern Iraq. By 2013, China was jointly operating three fields in the south of Iraq, producing 1.4 million barrels total per day – more than half of Iraq’s output.","1. Some sources suggest that China may have forgiven the Government of Iraq’s outstanding obligations to the Chinese Government in 2007 and it outstanding obligations to Chinese companies in 2010. However, AidData has not corroborated this claim, which merits further investigation.2. This record is not treated as an umbrella record since the debts forgiven were almost certainly contracted prior to 2000.3. There are several conflicting sources on the signing of the 2010 agreement. 'China cancels 80% of Iraq's debt' from the Australian newspaper The Sydney Morning Herald, quoting the Ministry of Finance of Iraq, say it was signed before February 2010. 'Iraq slashes Saddam-era debt owed by Madagascar' from Reuters suggests it was actually November 2009.

The cost of the project was primarily funded under “The Grant Aid Agreement on Economic & Technical Cooperation between the PRC and the GoJ”, which was signed on February 1, 2005.  The total cost of the project was 260 million Jamaican dollars, which included Chinese grant funding of 240 million Jamaican dollars and local sponsorship funding of 20 million Jamaican dollars. Local funding was contributed to by CHASE Fund, the Chinese Benevolent Association (CBA), and members of the local Chinese community.   The Chinese Government was responsible for architectural design, preparation of working drawings, and providing construction machinery, equipment and materials for the project. The design concept was prepared by China Architectural Group (CAG). The construction contract was awarded to Zhenjiang International Economic and Technical Cooperation Co. Ltd. of China (CZICC) on October 23, 2013.  The project was implemented by the Nature Preservation Foundation, which has a 49-year lease to manage the Hope Botanical Gardens. The construction period was 17 months from date of groundbreaking on February 20, 2014 to completion of civil works on July 31, 2015. The Nature Preservation Foundation undertook the landscaping phase once construction was completed. The Nature Preservation Foundation was also responsible for maintaining the structures and landscaping, including installing lightings and surveillance cameras.   The garden is 11 acres and located in the Hope Royal Botanic Gardens in east St. Andrew. Features of the Chinese Gardens include a lily pond, the Yingbi Wall or Shadow Wall, the Imperial Garden, and the Circular Mound or the Seat of Heaven. The garden’s architecture features aspects of the Chinese Forbidden City, an ancient imperial palace in Beijing, China during the era of the Ming Dynasty.   The Chinese Garden was originally intended to be handed over in August 2012 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jamaica's Independence and the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries. However, implementation was delayed due to difficulty securing formal approval for the project from all local regulatory agencies, including the National Environment and Planning Agency (NEPA), the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation (KSAC), the National Land Agency (NLA), the Jamaica National Heritage Trust (JNHT), and the National Works Agency (NWA).",NA,"# Sector

39764,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides $340 million preferential buyer’s credit for Jamaica Development Infrastructure Program (JDIP),"On February 3, 2010, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Government of Jamaica signed a $340,000,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the Jamaica Road Improvement & Rehabilitation Works Project, which is also known as the Jamaica Development Infrastructure Program (JDIP). According to internal records that Jamaica’s Ministry of Finance and the Public Service supplied to AidData in May 2020, the PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a maturity period of 15 years, grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 3%, a commitment fee of 0.75%, and a management fee of 1.0%. The first scheduled date of loan repayment was January 21, 2014 and the final date of scheduled loan repayment was July 21, 2025.   As of October 30, 2021, the loan had achieved a 100% disbursement rate ($340,000,000 out of $340,000,000). Its amount outstanding was $136,000,000 as of October 30, 2021.   The Government of Jamaica designed the JDIP to repair and maintain the country’s road network, which had suffered extensive damage after a series of hurricanes and floods. The JDIP consisted of major transportation and road construction, including the expansion of a major highway from two to four lanes and repairs to the main and parochial road network. The JDIP also supported 5 major projects called Christiana Development Road, the Fern Gully Rehabilitation Works, the Rio Grande Bridge and the Cassia Park and Queensborough Bridges. The total cost of the Jamaica Development Infrastructure Program (JDIP) was $400 million. 85 percent of the total project cost was financed through the $340 million preferential buyer’s credit loan facility, which the Government of Jamaica’s Road Maintenance Fund (RMF) contracted with China Eximbank. The Jamaican Government committed to funding the remaining 15% of the project cost with revenue obtained from a special consumption tax on fuel.   The Jamaican government agency responsible for project implementation oversight was the National Works Agency (NWA) and the Chinese firm responsible for project implementation was China Harbour Engineering Company Limited (CHEC).   The project officially commenced on September 1, 2010. Then in 2011, the Office of Contractor General of Jamaica (OCG) raised concerns about the selection of CHEC as the project contractor. It began an investigation in July 2011, and after a thorough OCG examination of the JDIP loan agreements, and a sworn statement to the OCG from the Portfolio Permanent Secretary, OCG failed to corroborate public statements that had been made by the then-Transport and Works Minister, Mike Henry, that it was the China Eximbank that had imposed the selection of CHEC upon the Jamaican Government. Then, in 2012, the China Eximbank-financed Jamaica Development Infrastructure Program (JDIP) was subjected to a forensic audit by an internationally renowned firm that specializes in investigations of fraud, abuse, and corruption (Kroll Associates Inc., or ""Kroll""). This audit (accessible via https://www.dropbox.com/s/3765fc4wpusrosi/JDIP%20Forensic%20Audit.pdf?dl=0) provides a rare glimpse of how domestic political pressures can influence site selection decisions in development projects financed by the Chinese government. Technical experts at the NWA—the government agency responsible for project implementation oversight—initially identified 19 potential projects for JDIP funding “based on road condition surveys, socio-economic factors, population density, access to essential services and agricultural interest.'' However, “tremendous influence was exerted from Members of Parliament, Parish Councils, Municipal Councils, and others."" Kroll refers to these political actors as “stakeholders” in its audit of the project and notes that they “collectively considered JDIP as a facility to improve roads in the respective [geographical] areas.'
