On July 4, 2019, the handover ceremony for the Apia Waterfront Events Space, Clock Tower Boulevard, and Volleyball Courts Project occurred. As noted by Chinese Ambassador Chao Xiaoliang, the Events Space and Clock Tower Boulevard were funded by the New Zealand government while the volleyball courts were funded by the Chinese Government.   In the same speech, Chao Xiaoliang also mentioned that the construction of the entire Friendship Park would be finished in 2020.  The project was expected to be complete in June 2020. However, a measles outbreak in the fall of 2019 and the Covid-19 global pandemic in 2020 temporarily halted project implementation activities, as workers could not travel. Then, in February 2020, it was announced that the opening of the Friendship Park would be delayed from March 2020 to May 2020 due to poor weather. Construction resumed in May 2021 and was expected to be complete by October 2021.
