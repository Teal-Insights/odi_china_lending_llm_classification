42300,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,Chinese Government provides $1.32 million grant for provision of 23 school buses,"According to a spokesman from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Chinese Government and the Government of Macedonia signed a grant agreement in early 2011 for the provision of 23 school buses. The reported monetary value of the grant commitment from China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) was $1.32 million (EUR 1 million). Each of these yellow buses — manufactured by the Yutong (a Chinese company) — was equipped with 35 seats, automatic doors, fire extinguishers, and seat belts. The ultimate purpose of the project was to support the transportation of students to and from primary and secondary schools in Macedonia’s rural areas.   China National Corporation for Overseas Economic Cooperation (CCOEC) was the contractor responsible for the acquisition and delivery of the buses. The buses were officially handed over to the Macedonian authorities on November 25, 2011. The Ambassador of China to Macedonia, Cui Zhivei, and Deputy Prime Minister for European Affairs and National Coordinator for Foreign Aid, Teuta Arifi, attended the handover ceremony. Then, in February 2012, Macedonia’s Deputy Prime Minister for European Affairs and National Coordinator for Foreign Aid, Teuta Arifi, signed an agreement with the President of the Association of Local Self-Government Units, Koce Trajanovski. The agreement specified that twenty-three municipalities in Macedonia would receive one of the donated school buses.  Chinese citizens criticized their government's decision to carry forward with the donation in the wake of a ""school bus"" (repurposed minivan) crash less than two weeks prior that had led to the deaths of 19 preschoolers.  The van was carrying 64 people, well over its capacity, and the crash highlighted the poor state of school transportation infrastructure in China—an issue Chinese citizens had been pressuring their government to address for years.  Ironically, the day after the donation, another school bus carrying 39 people in Liaoning province encountered an accident that led to 35 students being injured, with two 7-year-olds incurring serious head injuries.  Given these events, there were concerns raised regarding the safety of the donated vehicles, as well.","One source suggests that the grant proceeds for this project were drawn from an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) that the Chinese Government and Government of Macedonia signed in 2008, but this issue requires further investigation.The Chinese project title is 马其顿校车项目.
