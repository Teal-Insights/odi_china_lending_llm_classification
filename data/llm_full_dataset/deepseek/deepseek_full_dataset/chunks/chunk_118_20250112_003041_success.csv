96108,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,ICBC provides $1.2 billion loan to KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi for the construction of the Odayeri-Paşaköy Section of the Northern Marmara Motorway (including Third Bosphorus Bridge) Project,"On May 29, 2012, Turkey's Ministry of Transport granted a 10-year concession agreement to ICA IC İçtaş Astaldi Üçüncü Boğaz Köprüsü ve Kuzey Marmara Otoyolu Yatırım ve İşletme A.Ş. (IC Ictas-Astaldi or ICA) — a joint venture between an Italian construction company called Astaldi S.P.A (33.33% ownership stake) and a Turkish construction company called IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S. (66.66% ownership stake) — for the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project (also known as the Third Bosphorus Bridge PPP Project and the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge PPP Project). 30 months of the 10-year concession is for bridge construction activities and the remaining period is for bridge management activities. The public-private partnership (PPP) project was implemented on a BOT (Build, Operate, Transfer) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. The original, non-recourse $2.67 billion debt financing package consisted of two syndicated loan agreements with two different special purpose vehicles (project companies): a $1.04 billion loan with Avrupa Otoyolu Yatirim ve Iletme A.S. for the 171 km Kurtköy-Akyazı Section (“Asia Section” or “NMM Asia”) of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project and a $1.63 billion loan with KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. for the 90 km Kınalı-Odayeri Section (“Europe Section” or “NMM Europe”) of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project. The loan agreements were signed in September 2013 and financial close was achieved May 2014. The loan were issued by six local banks, including Turkish banks (Türkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Is Bankasi A.S., QNB Finansbank A.S., T.C. Ziraat Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. and Türkiye Vakiflar Bankasi T.A.O.). One loan will mature in December 2022 (with a fixed interest rate of 7.6%) and the other will mature in June 2024 (with a floating interest rate of LIBOR + 550 basis points).   Additionally, $600 million of equity financing was provided by Astaldi S.P.A and IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S.: $387.33 million IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S. and $193.67 million from Astaldi S.P.A. The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee, agreeing to repay the debt incurred by borrower/project company (IC Ictas-Astaldi) in the event that it defaulted on its repayment obligations. The Government of Turkey’s General Directorate of Highways (KGM) also provided a minimum traffic guarantee to the project company (to secure the payback of the debt and equity if the generated revenue was insufficient).   Then, in 2018, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's branch in Turkey (ICBC Turkey) was mandated by IC Ictas-Astaldi to lead and arrange syndication for the refinancing of $2.67 billion of debt used to construct the Third Bosphorus Bridge (or Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge) and North Marmara Motorway PPP Project. A letter of authorization for the refinancing was signed at the One Belt, One Road Investment and Financial Cooperation Summit in Ankara on July 26, 2018. Under the agreement, ICBC Turkey agreed in principle to facilitate the refinancing of the project, previously funded by the Turkish banking system, on more favorable terms.   Then, in September 2019, two syndicated loan agreements worth $4.435 billion were signed (with ICBC serving as the lead arranger) for the Kurtköy-Akyazı and Kınalı-Odayeri sections of the project: a $2,840,000,000 loan agreement was signed by KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. and a group of ten lenders (ICBC Turkey, Bank of China, Kuveyt Türk Katilim Bankasi A.S., Albaraka Türk Katılım Bankası A.Ş., Türkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Is Bankasi A.S., QNB Finansbank A.S., T.C. Ziraat Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. and Türkiye Vakiflar Bankasi T.A.O.) to refinance the $1.04 billion loan that was issued in September 2013 for the 171 km Kurtköy-Akyazı Section of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project and finance new/additional capex requirements as a result of changes in the project scope (that increased the total cost of the project’s 171 km Kurtköy-Akyazı Section to $3.646 billion); and a $1,595,000,000 loan was signed by KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. and a group of ten lenders (ICBC Turkey, Bank of China, Kuveyt Türk Katilim Bankasi A.S., Albaraka Türk Katılım Bankası A.Ş., Türkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Is Bankasi A.S., QNB Finansbank A.S., T.C. Ziraat Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. and Türkiye Vakiflar Bankasi T.A.O.) to refinance the $1.63 billion loan that was issued in September 2013 for the 90 km Kınalı-Odayeri Section of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project and finance new/additional capex requirements as a result of changes in the project scope (that increased the total cost of the project’s 90 km Kınalı-Odayeri Section to $2.077 billion). The two loans have two different maturity lengths, reflecting the different concession lengths of the two sponsors. The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee for both loans on September 16, 2019. The total amount that was reportedly provided (across both loans) by ICBC Turkey was $1 billion (as captured via Project ID#67325). Bank of China’s estimated contribution to both loans ($381,666,666) is captured via Project ID#67331.   Then, on December 2, 2021, ICBC and KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. signed a $1,198,302,550 loan agreement (captured via Project ID#96108) to refinance a $2,138,000,000 loan that was issued on May 13, 2014 signed in 2014 and a $420,000,000 loan that was issued on March 11, 2016 for the Odayeri-Paşaköy Section of the Northern Marmara Motorway (including Third Bosphorus Bridge) Project. The borrowing terms of the ICBC loan are unknown.  The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee for the $1,198,302,550 loan on December 2, 2021.  The purpose of the project was to construct a 1.408 kilometer long-span bridge to be used by road vehicles and trains to cross the Bosphorus Strait from Poyrazkoy in Asia to Garipce in Europe, as well as the construction of a section of the North Marmara Highway along the Odayeri-Pasakoy route. The bridge is 59 meters long and it stretches 1,408 meters over the Bosporus, linking the European and Asian sides of Istanbul. It has eight highway lanes (4 in each direction), divided by two high-speed rail corridors of 1,048 meters. The bridge is a critical part of the larger Northern Marmara Highway (Motorway) Project, linking to the Odayeri-Pasaköy route of the Motorway. The 261 km km Northern Marmara Highway was intended to increase economic efficiency in Turkey, allow for greater access to Istanbul Airport, provide alternate routes to going through Istanbul, and start on the western side of Istanbul and end in the eastern Marmara province of Sakarya. ICA IC İçtaş Astaldi Üçüncü Boğaz Köprüsü ve Kuzey Marmara Otoyolu Yatırım ve İşletme A.Ş. (IC Ictas-Astaldi) was responsible for project implementation. Construction began in September 2012 using the SPV's equity, and was originally expected to take 36 months. The Odayeri-Paşaköy section of the motorway was completed August 26, 2016. The Kurtköy-Akyazı section of the project was completed and opened to traffic on December 19, 2020.   On December 23, 2019, China Merchants Expressway Network & Technology Holdings Co. Ltd, China Merchants Union (BVI) Limited, Jiangsu Expressway Company Limited, Zhejiang Expressway Co. Ltd., Anhui Expressway Company Limited and Sichuan Expressway Co announced that it had entered an agreement and jointly set up a consortium company (“Consortium Company”) to acquire: (1) 51% equity stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi (the SPV responsible for the Third Bosphorus Bridge PPP Project); (2) 51% of a related shareholder loan of IC Ictas-Astaldi; and (3) 51% equity stake in Eurasia Motorway Maintenance and Operations Limited (“IC Maintenance”), a company engages in the operations and maintenance of projects operated by IC Ictas-Astaldi. Shareholders of the Consortium Company expected to invest up to $688.5 million. As a part of the acquisition, China Merchants, China Merchants United, Zhejiang Expressway, Jiangsu Expressway, Sichuan Expressway and Anhui Expressway held 31%, 20%, 17.5%, 17.5%, 7% and 7% equity stakes in the Consortium Company, respectively. Upon completion of the acquisition, the Zhejiang Expressway Co., Ltd. would indirectly hold an 8.925% equity stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi, 8.925% of the related shareholder loan of IC Ictas-Astaldi, and an 8.925% equity stake in IC Maintenance, respectively. However, the preliminary agreement that was signed on December 23, 2019 was interrupted due to the Covid-19 pandemic. ICBC, Bank of China, and China Merchants Bank subsequently indicated that they were willing to issue a $1.6 billion loan to the Consortium Company in 2021 to facilitate their acquisition of a 51% ownership stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi for $688.5 million. Their loan would mature in 2027, just before the project company’s concession expired. Sinosure would provide credit insurance. However, IJ Global reported in August 2021 that the Chinese companies in the Consortium Company requested to enter into negotiations to terminate the acquisition agreement. Then, in March 2020, Astaldi sold its stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi (the SPV) to IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S., with the latter becoming the sole owner.","1. Some sources suggest that the $1,198,302,550 loan is a syndicated loan and Bank of China is a participant in the syndicate. This issue warrants further investigation. 2. Some sources suggest that the December 2, 2021 loan agreement was worth $2.4 billion rather than $1,198,302,550. This issue warrants further investigation. 3.

The purpose of the project is to contribute to renewable and zero carbon supply of electricity to the national grid, contribute to Turkey’s energy transition, and help meet the increasing electricity demands throughout Turkey. The project scope involves the installation of a 1.35 GW solar power plant in Karapınar district and Konya Province consisting of 3,376,890 photovoltaic (PV) panels with a gross capacity of approximately 1,000 MWac or 1,348 megawatts of DC power (MWdc), two substations (a 400kV substation at the north of the site and a 154kV substation at the south of the site), mounting and tracking structures, DC/AC current inverters, cabling, transformers, a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, and electrical transmission lines (ETLs)—a 154kV ETL and two 380kV ETLs, which are all under 5km in length—to connect the produced electricity to the national grid. The 19.2km2 project site lies in the Central Anatolia region, approximately 100km away from the Konya airport. The Karapınar solar park will comprise up to 3.5 million ground-mounted photovoltaic (PV) solar modules for a total net output of 1,000MW. The other main components in the project include mounting (tracking) structures, DC/AC inverters, cable networks, transformers, substations, energy transmission lines, and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. The project involves the construction of two electrical substations, one in the northern section and the other on the southern edge of the site. It will utilise 400kV, 154kV, and 33kV feeders along with IEC 61850-based substation automation system. The Karapınar solar power project is planned to be developed in two phases, 200MW in phase one and 800MW in phase two. The other infrastructure facilities for the project include stormwater management, water supply, and drainage systems, apart from site fencing, a control building, a spare parts storage facility, and site access, and an internal road network.   The electricity generated by the Karapınar solar power station will be evacuated to the national electricity grid through two separate connections. While a 400kV power transmission line will be connected to Yeşilhisar Substation, another 154kV power evacuation line will be connected to the Karapınar Substation for onward transmission into the grid. The project is part of the first solar tender launched by the Turkish Ministry of Energy under the Renewable Energy Resources Zones (YEKA) program in 2017, and hence a pathfinder for the sector. The deal was awarded to the lowest bid, with Kalyon offering $0.0699 per kWh and winning a 15-year PPA. The operating license for the project is 30 years.   Genel Elektrik Sistemleri (GES), Vekon, Chain Logistics, Nexten Enerji, RINA Company, UK Grid Solutions Ltd and China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC) are some of the contractors responsible for project implementation. Kalyon Enerji Group entered into a joint venture agreement with China Electronics Technology Corporation (CETC) for the development of the Karapınar solar power plant along with a PV module manufacturing facility. Genel Elektrik Sistemleri (GES) was awarded a turnkey contract for the basic and detailed design, equipment supply, erection, testing, and commissioning of the 400kV and 154kV substations for the project in November 2019. Vekon started manufacturing and supplying the profile structures for the Karapınar solar power project in July 2020, while Chain Logistics was contracted for the transportation of solar panels. Nexten Enerji was contracted for the construction and repair maintenance operations of the Karapınar project, while Vigi Group was contracted by the Kalyon Enerji and CETC consortium for the project management services in September 2019. RINA Company was contracted for the preparation of the environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) report for the project in 2020. RINA was also engaged to carry out the site survey and investigation in December 2017. UK Grid Solutions Ltd, owned by General Electric Company, is supplying inverter stations, tracker systems and other electrical supplies to the project. Technology is also being provided by China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC). Construction began on October 24, 2019. The Phase 1 production line was commissioned on August 19, 2020. The project was originally scheduled for full-scale commissioning in August 2023.","1.
