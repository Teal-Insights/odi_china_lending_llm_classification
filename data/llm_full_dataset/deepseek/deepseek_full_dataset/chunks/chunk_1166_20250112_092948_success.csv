The loan has a 10-year maturity and it carries an annual interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.515% in December 2012) plus a 5.2% margin. It is to be repaid in fifteen (15) installments within (10) ten years of the issuance of the loan. It is collateralized by, among other things, corporate guarantees from the DSSP and a sister company called PT Manggala Alam Lestari (MAL) and fiduciary securities on insurance claims, receivables incurred in relation to PPA between DSSP PSumsel and PLN, DSSP PSumsel’s building, office and miscellaneous equipment, vehicles and power plant assets and pledge of DSSP PSumsel shares owned by DSSE. Also, as of December 31, 2016, the 300MW Sumsel-5 Power Plant (SS-5) itself was pledged as a source of collateral for the CDB loan.

On February 11, 2012, DSSP Sumsel had signed an equipment supply contract with CNEEC with contract prices amounting to $208,380,392. On the same day, a Design, Engineering and Construction contract was signed with HPI for the contract price of $89,305,882. HPI is designated to perform the design, engineering, installation and construction for the project. The 300MW Sumsel-5 Power Plant (SS-5) Construction Project was implemented as an Independent Power Project (IPP) and its total cost ($400 million) was financed with a mix of debt and equity. Sinar Mas Group was the source of equity.

This project is also known as the SUMSEL-5 CFSPP 2 × 150MW Power Plant and Sumsel-5 Pithead Coal-fired Power Plant Project. The Chinese project title is 印尼SUMSEL-5 2x150MW坑口燃煤电站项目. 2. The Sumsel-5 Power Plant benefits from a favorable 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), which was signed in November 2011. The PPA provides capacity and energy payments to cover the plant's fixed and variable costs, respectively, as long as the power plant meets minimum contractually required levels for availability factor and heat rate. Fuel supply risk is mitigated via Sumsel's 25-year coal supply agreement with its sister company, PT Manggala Alam Lestari (MAL), and the pass-through of fuel costs to PLN. Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) is an Indonesian government-owned corporation that has a monopoly on electricity distribution in Indonesia and generates the majority of the country's electrical power.The project is coded as mixed intent as it is a USD-denominated facility used to finance commercial supply and EPC contracts with Chinese companies, which resembles that of an export buyer's credit.","# Sector

Members of the lending syndicate included BCA, Bank DKI, Bank Panin, Bank bjb (Bank Jabar Banten), ICBC Indonesia, Export-Import Bank of Malaysia Berhad (Mexim), Deutsche Bank Indonesia, BII (Maybank Indonesia), and Bank CIMB Niaga. The syndicated credit facility was divided into three tranches and the maximum amount of the credit facility is IDR 8,800,000 million with the first scheduled drawdown in June 2013. It carried a 15-year maturity and an estimated average interest rate of 9.86%. The loan was secured by (collateralized with) receivables, assets, escrow account, shares issued, assignment of rights agreement and a letter of undertaking from UEM Group Berhad, shareholders of the project company (PT Lintas Marga Sedaya) and Mezzanine creditors. ICBC Indonesia contributed IDR 366 billion to the syndicated loan, which carried a 15-year maturity an unknown interest rate.   The IDR 12 trillion project involved the construction, ownership and operation of a 116 km toll road connecting Cikampek and Palimanan in the West Java province. It consisted of 6 sections: Section I, Cikopo–Kalijati (29.12 kilometers); Section II, Kalijati–Subang (9.56 kilometers); Section III, Subang–Cikedung (31.37 kilometers); Section IV, Cikedung–Kertajati (17.66 kilometers); Section V, Kertajati–Sumberjaya (14.51 kilometers); and Section VI, Sumberjaya–Palimanan (13.78 kilometers).   Construction began on December 11, 2011.  As of July 2012, 95 percent of land acquisition was achieved. However, the syndicated loan did not disburse until 100% of land acquisition was achieved. The first loan disbursement took place in September 2012.  As of January 2014, the project had achieved a 15 percent physical completion rate and the toll road was expected to go into operation in late 2014 or early 2015. The toll road was ultimately opened to traffic by Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, on June 13, 2015.    Within 10 days of the road being inaugurated, there were 30 car accidents that led to injuries and fatalities. Not all of the rest areas along the toll road were in operation, causing drivers to drive continuously with no rest. Another apparent reason for the car accidents was the absence of lighting facilities. The project had both environmental and social impacts. Key environmental impacts included: major changes in land use in construction areas; increased noise, erosion, dust, waste and traffic, especially during construction; and degradation of environmental quality. Social impacts included: some 5,617 Project Affected People (PAP), mainly due to land acquisition; and project alignment to accommodate 2 cultural sites (an ancestor tomb and a sacred well).

ICBC contributes IDR 366 billion to syndicated loan for Cikampek-Palimanan Toll Road Development Project

# Description
On September 26, 2012, PT Lintas Marga Sedaya (LMS) — a project company and special purpose vehicle — signed an IDR 8.8 trillion syndicated loan agreement with a group of 22 banks and financial institutions (including ICBC Indonesia) for the Cikampek-Palimanan Toll Road Development Project. Members of the lending syndicate included BCA, Bank DKI, Bank Panin, Bank bjb (Bank Jabar Banten), ICBC Indonesia, Export-Import Bank of Malaysia Berhad (Mexim), Deutsche Bank Indonesia, BII (Maybank Indonesia), and Bank CIMB Niaga. The syndicated credit facility was divided into three tranches and the maximum amount of the credit facility is IDR 8,800,000 million with the first scheduled drawdown in June 2013. It carried a 15-year maturity and an estimated average interest rate of 9.86%. The loan was secured by (collateralized with) receivables, assets, escrow account, shares issued, assignment of rights agreement and a letter of undertaking from UEM Group Berhad, shareholders of the project company (PT Lintas Marga Sedaya) and Mezzanine creditors. ICBC Indonesia contributed IDR 366 billion to the syndicated loan, which carried a 15-year maturity an unknown interest rate.   The IDR 12 trillion project involved the construction, ownership and operation of a 116 km toll road connecting Cikampek and Palimanan in the West Java province. It consisted of 6 sections: Section I, Cikopo–Kalijati (29.12 kilometers); Section II, Kalijati–Subang (9.56 kilometers); Section III, Subang–Cikedung (31.37 kilometers); Section IV, Cikedung–Kertajati (17.66 kilometers); Section V, Kertajati–Sumberjaya (14.51 kilometers); and Section VI, Sumberjaya–Palimanan (13.78 kilometers).   Construction began on December 11, 2011.  As of July 2012, 95 percent of land acquisition was achieved. However, the syndicated loan did not disburse until 100% of land acquisition was achieved. The first loan disbursement took place in September 2012.  As of January 2014, the project had achieved a 15 percent physical completion rate and the toll road was expected to go into operation in late 2014 or early 2015. The toll road was ultimately opened to traffic by Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, on June 13, 2015.    Within 10 days of the road being inaugurated, there were 30 car accidents that led to injuries and fatalities. Not all of the rest areas along the toll road were in operation, causing drivers to drive continuously with no rest. Another apparent reason for the car accidents was the absence of lighting facilities. The project had both environmental and social impacts. Key environmental impacts included: major changes in land use in construction areas; increased noise, erosion, dust, waste and traffic, especially during construction; and degradation of environmental quality. Social impacts included: some 5,617 Project Affected People (PAP), mainly due to land acquisition; and project alignment to accommodate 2 cultural sites (an ancestor tomb and a sacred well).

CDB was the original lender and arranger and Bank of China Jakarta branch was the facility agent.
