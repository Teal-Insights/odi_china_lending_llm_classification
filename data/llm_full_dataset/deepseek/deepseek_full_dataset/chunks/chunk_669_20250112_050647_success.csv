A pre-export finance (PXF) facility an arrangement in which a commodity (e.g. oil) producer gets up-front cash from a customer in return for a promise to repay the customer with that commodity (possibly at a discount) in the future. PXF funds may be advanced by a lender or syndicate of lenders to a commodity producer to assist the company in meeting either its working capital needs (for example, to cover the purchase of raw materials and costs associated with processing, storage and transport) or its capital investment needs (for example, investment in plant and machinery and other elements of infrastructure). PXF facilities are usually secured by (1) an assignment of rights by the producer under an ‘offtake contract’ (i.e., a sale and purchase contract between the producer and a buyer of that producer of goods or commodities), and (2) a collection account charge over a bank account into which proceeds due to the producer from the buyer of the goods or commodities under the offtake contract are credited. There are two key documents in prepayment finance transactions: a contract providing for the advance payment by the offtaker to the producer for the purchase of goods/commodities (the 'Prepayment Contract'), and a loan agreement between a lender and the offtaker (the 'Offtaker Loan Agreement') under which the advance payment is financed.2.

58342,HEALTH,China Development Bank provides $67.3 million buyer’s credit loan for Supply of Computed Tomography (CT) Scanners to GOK Hospitals Project (Linked to Project ID#52926),"On December 11, 2017, China Development Bank and the Government of Kenya’s National Treasury signed a buyer’s credit loan agreement worth $67.3 million (KES 7 billion) for the supply of computed tomography (CT) scanners to 37 public county hospitals. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 5.66-year maturity (final maturity date: April 15, 2023) and an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus a 4.95% margin. It was scheduled for repayment in semi-annual installments and backed by a Sinosure credit insurance policy. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 80% of the cost of a commercial contract between Neusoft Medical Systems Co., Ltd (东软医疗系统有限公司) -- a Chinese medical equipment manufacturer -- and Kenya’s Ministry of Health, which was signed in August 2017. The Government of Kenya was responsible for directly financing the remaining 20% of the commercial contract cost.   The borrower made principal repayments worth $20,000,000 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and $20,000,000 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022).

According to the novation agreement, KETRACO is required to make bi-annual payments to the Government of Kenya (GoK). However, as at 30 June, 2020, KETRACO had not made any payments to GoK, as stipulated in the novation agreement. Management has indicated that a moratorium for twenty-four (24) months had been sought from The National Treasury. However, this request for moratorium was yet to be considered by the National Treasury. It is unclear which loan this is referring to. 4. The KETRACO project identification number is KET/2/9/4/122. e-ProMIS identifies the total project cost as USD 134.4 million. 5. This China Eximbank loan is not included in the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020. Nor is it included in the China’s Overseas Development Finance Dataset that Boston University's Global Development Policy Center published in December 2020.6.

# Title
China Eximbank provides $90.2 million buyer’s credit loan for Kamburu-Embu-Kibirigwi-Thika Transmission Line Project

# Description
On August 1, 2017, China Eximbank and the Government of Kenya signed a $90,286,383.39 buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement for the Kamburu-Embu-Kibirigwi-Thika Transmission Line Project. The loan carries a maturity of 17 years (final maturity date: July 21, 2034). The other borrowing terms of the BCL are unknown.   However, it is known that the proceeds of the BCL were on-lent to a Kenyan state-owned electricity company called the Kenya Electricity Transmission Company Limited (KETRACO). The ultimate borrower, KETRACO, used the proceeds of the BCL to finance approximately 85% of the total cost of a $118 million commercial contract between a consortium consisting of China North Industrial Corporation (NORINCO, 中国北方工业有限公司) and Shandong Taikai Power Engineering Co. (TKPE, 山东泰开电力建设工程有限公司) and Kenya's Ministry of Energy and Petroleum, which was signed on January 29, 2016 and amended on May 26, 2017, October 18, 2019, and April 30, 2020.   No BCL (loan) disbursements or principal repayments took place between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021 and 2021-2022). The loan’s amount outstanding was zero as of June 30, 2021 and zero as of June 30, 2022.  The purpose of the project is to construct (1) a 153 km, 220kV transmission line from Kamburu to Kibirigwi (via Thika and Embu) with bay extension at the Kamburu substation, (2) a 3 km 132 kV transmission line and three 150MVA 220/132kV substations at Embu, Kibirigwi and Thika, and (3) a 132kV LILO substation at Kibirigwi on the Masinga/Kutus transmission line.   NORINCO and TKPE are the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) was carried out for the project in June 2009. Then, a November 2018 Sector Report from the Government of Kenya's Treasury Department identified the project as having cumulative expenditures of KES 2.651 billion as of June 30, 2018; it also identified the project as having achieved a 1% completion rate, with a status designation of ‘need[s] budget provision.’ However, by 2021, the project had achieved a 50% completion rate.

58737,WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION,China Eximbank provides $200.5 million loan — via EPCF arrangement — for Karimenu II Dam Water Supply Project,"On April 24, 2017, Kenya's Ministry of Water and Sanitation -- through Athi Water Services Board (AWSB) -- signed an Engineering, Construction, Procurement, and Financing (EPCF) contract worth $235,918,461 with M/S Avic International Holding Corporation and Shanghai Municipal Engineering Design Institute (Group) Co., LTD Joint Venture (AVIC & SMEDI JV) for the Karimenu II Dam Water Supply Project. AVIC & SMEDI JV, in turn, secured a $200,530,600 loan on February 14, 2017 from China Eximbank to finance 85% of the cost of the $235,918,461 EPCF contract. The loan’s final maturity date is July 21, 2042 and it is repayable in 20 equal, semi-annual installments. Therefore, its implied maturity length and grace period are 25.5 years and 15.5 years, respectively. The Government of Kenya appears to have issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan.   Loan disbursements worth $13,364,912.29 took place between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021). Loan disbursements worth $133,093,268.26 took place between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022).  The loan’s amount outstanding was $11,795,831.20 as of June 30, 2020, $25,160,743.49 as of June 30, 2021, and $158,254,011.75 as of June 30, 2022.   The Karimenu II Dam Water Supply Project involves the construction of a 59-meter-high dam with a capacity of 26.5 million cubic meters of water, a water treatment plant (with 70,000 m3 per day of capacity), and a water distribution system (involving 67 km of raw and treated water pipelines and two terminal tanks in Ruiru and Juja). It will be constructed across Kariminu River at Kiriko in Gatundu North Sub-County, Kiambu County in order to supply an additional 850,000 people with 70 million liters/day of water to Juja Town (11.75 million liters/day), Ruiru Town (35.25 million liters/day) and Nairobi City (23 million liters/day). It is just upstream of the main bridge linking Buchana to Kariko and Gituamba Markets about 6km from Kanyoni market on the Thika – Gituamba road. The dam will be constructed across Kariminu River downstream of its confluence with its tributaries including Gathanje, Kagundu and Githanga. The project requires the acquisition of 600 acres of land: 171 acres during phase 1 for the dam’s embankment and water draw-off structures and 429 acres during phase 2 for the reservoir area.   AVIC & SMEDI JV is the EPC contract responsible for implementation.  The project was originally scheduled to commence in January 2018 and reach completion by December 2022. However, it has encountered various delays and implementation challenges. After mobilization of the environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) study team, a commencement meeting with Athi Water Services Board (AWSB) took place on March 16, 2016, followed by a combined reconnaissance site visit on April 6, 2016. Then, in mid-2017, an advance payment worth 20% of the EPCF contract ($47,183,692) was made to AVIC & SMEDI JV against a bank guarantee. On March 28, 2019, a Kenyan parliamentary committee conducted an on-site project inspection and found that no works had commenced 24 months after agreements were signed and an advance payment of KES 4 billion ($47,183,692) was made to the contractor (AAVIC & SMEDI JV). The committee also found that Athi Water Services Board had not yet issued a commencement to proceed letter to the EPCF contractor because of land acquisition challenges. The parliamentary committee also called upon Kenya's Auditor General to conduct a special audit to ""investigate the circumstance under which agreements were signed between the Athi Water Works Develoment Agency and the contractor (AVIC International) and advance payments were made before the acquisition of the requisite land for implementation of the Karimenu II Dam leading to loss of public funds through idle time."" It further recommended that ""[i]f any culpability is found, the perpetrators should be prosecuted."" A resettlement action plan (RAP) was implemented for priority areas, and a compensation process for 246 project affected persons was undertaken in order to acquire 171 acres of land (as part of phase 1). However, in early 2021, Gatundu North residents who had surrendered 383 acres of land for construction (phase 2) had still not received compensation and they vowed to block excavation works at the project site. One local resident said “[w]e gave the land to the government for the construction of the dam and we were promised to wait for compensation several months ago. We are, however, shocked that the land is being excavated even before we get our pay,.” Jane Wanjiru, another resident, said that the surrendered land was their only source of livelihood and they had not cultivated this season to allow for the construction of the dam: “[w]e can’t fight the government; we hope that this matter is resolved. These frustrations are making us hopeless and we need to have our lives back. We are calling on the National Land Commission (NLC), which has been executing the compensation exercise and the Athi Water Services that is implementing the project to intervene and solve the prevailing tussle to allow smooth construction works to go on.” Construction ultimately began on or near August 1, 2019. As of September 2019, the project had achieved a 5% completion rate. June 2021, a pipe laying works ceremony took place. At that point in time, the project had achieved a 45% completion rate and the other key project milestones that had not yet been met were groundbreaking, tunnel breakthrough, completion of tunnel secondary lining, river diversion, and substantial completion of dam foundation treatment works. The dam was ultimately completed and officially completed on August 1, 2022.","1. This project is also known as the Kariminu II Dam Project. The Chinese project title is Karimenu大坝供水项 or 肯尼亚卡瑞曼纽大坝供水项目. 2. Joseph Wairagu Irungu, the Principal Secretary of Kenya’s Ministry of Water and Sanitation, identified the face value of the China Eximbank loan as KES 23.6 billion on January 1, 2019. However, AidData relies upon the face value of the loan ($200,530,600) that is recorded in the Government of Kenya’s external public debt register (https://www.treasury.go.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/External-Public-Debt-Register-as-at-End-June-2020.pdf). 3. In the database of Chinese loan commitments that it released in July 2020, SAIS-CARI identifies the face value of the China Eximbank loan for the Karimenu II Dam Water Supply Project as $31 million. Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center reports a face value of $229 million in its China’s Global Development Finance Dataset. AidData instead relies on the $200,530,600 that is recorded in the Government of Kenya’s external public debt register. 4. Karimenu II Dam was first identified through a feasibility study carried out in 2012 by the AWSB as a source of water for supply to Ruiru and Juja towns and parts of Nairobi. 5. Under most EPCF contractual arrangements, a loan is extended to the EPC contractor but with a sovereign guarantee from the host government. Therefore, AidData assumes that the loan issued to AVIC & SMEDI JV is backed by a repayment guarantee from the Government of Kenya (i.e. a sovereign guarantee). 6.
