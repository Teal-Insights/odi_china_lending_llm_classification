According to the Government of Cameroon's Caisse Autonome d'Amortissements (CAA), the loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 2 year grace period, a 11 year maturity, and an interest rate of 6.3%. The proceeds of the loan are to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract between the Government of Cameroon’s Délégation Générale à la Sûreté Nationale (DGSN or General Delegation for National Security) and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., which was signed in February 2017. As of December 31, 2020, the loan had achieved a 76.1% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 5.3 billion) and its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 17 billion.   The project involves the installation of 1,500 video-surveillance cameras in various cities and towns and the acquisition of 2,000 portable two-way radios. During phase 1 of the project, video-surveillance cameras will be installed in the capital cities of the country’s ten regions (Ngaoundere, Yaoundé, Bertoua, Maroua, Douala, Garoua, Bamenda, Bafoussam, Ebolowa, and Buea) as well as the towns of Kribi, Kyé-Ossi.
