34468,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",China Development Bank provides EUR 452.75 million loan for Myanmar-China Gas Pipeline Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#73285),"In December 2008, CNPC signed a 30-year purchase and sale agreement with South Korean conglomerate Daewoo International on importing natural gas from offshore blocks A-1 and A-3 in Myanmar (a project referred to as the Shwe Gas Project). A consortium of companies were involved in the Shwe Gas Project, led by Daewoo. Over 2009 and 2010, a series of agreements were signed on constructing, operating and managing the Myanmar-China Oil and Gas Pipelines, which clarified the rights and obligations of the two joint ventures responsible for these pipelines: Southeast Asia Gas Pipeline Co. Ltd. (SEAGP) and Southeast Asia Oil Pipeline Co. Ltd. (SEAOP).  On March 26, 2009, representatives from the Chinese Government and the Government of Myanmar signed cooperative agreements to jointly develop oil and gas pipelines. In June 2009, CNPC and the Government of Myanmar signed a MOU agreeing that CNPC would be responsible for the design, construction and operation of a 771km oil pipeline.  On November 30, 2010, China Development Bank and Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB) signed an agreement on cooperation in loan disbursement. Then, on December 16, 2010, China Development Bank and Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) — a state-owned oil and gas company in Myanmar — signed an EUR 452.75 million loan facility agreement (ID# 5300942322010591241) for the Myanmar-China Gas Pipeline Construction Project. The loan was provided in two tranches for two subcomponents of the project — an EUR 334 million tranche for the Offshore Natural Gas Pipeline and an EUR 119 million tranche for the Onshore Natural Gas Pipeline — and it carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, and an interest rate of 4.5%. An overseas euro currency account was established at the Frankfurt Branch of the Bank of China as part of the loan agreement between MFTB and China Development Bank, and revenue generated by the gas pipeline project was to be paid into the account. The borrower was expected to maintain a minimum cash balance in the overseas euro currency account. The balance of the account was at least $77,186,466 in Fiscal Year 2016-17.  The borrower had made principal repayments worth EUR 67.78 million and interest repayments worth EUR 114.37 million as of March 31, 2018. The loan’s (principal) amount outstanding was EUR 380 million (in loan principal and interest) as of March 31, 2007 and EUR 493.55 million (EUR 384.97 million in loan principal and EUR 108.58 million in loan interest) as of March 31, 2018.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 793 km gas pipeline from Ramree Island on the western coast of Myanmar to Ruili in China’s Yunnan Province. Running in parallel with the Myanmar-China Crude Oil Pipeline, the crude pipeline is 1,016 mm in diameter with a distance of 793km in Myanmar. It was designed to deliver 5.2 billion m3 per year upon completion of the project’s first phase, and 12 billion m3 per year upon completion of the project’s second phase. Pursuant to the cooperation agreement, four gas off-take stations (Kyaukphyu, Yenangyaung, Taungtha and Mandalay) were established to unload less than 20% of the pipeline’s total delivery in Myanmar. These 4 gas distribution stations deliver 2 billion cubic meters of natural gas to the local communities on a yearly basis. In particular, the pipeline supplies natural gas to a power plant in Kyaukpyu, thus enabling a substantially longer time of power supply. The Myanmar-China Gas Pipeline was designed to alleviate China’s dependence on the Strait of Malacca for its energy imports, giving it a shorter and alternate supply route from South East Asia.  Three CNPC subsidiaries -- China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering Co., Ltd. (CPP), CNPC Chuanqing Drilling Engineering Company Limited (CCDC), and Daqing Oilfield Engineering Co., Ltd -- were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation.  Construction started on June 3, 2010 and ended in June 2013. Then, on July 28, 2013, the Myanmar-China Gas Pipeline became operational and started to deliver natural gas to the Myanmar market through its off-take stations.   South-East Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited (SEAGP) --  a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of CNPC-SEAP (50.9% stake), MOGE (7.365% stake), POSCO DAEWOO Corporation (25.041% stake), ONGC CASPIAN E&P B.V. (8.347% stake), Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL) (4.1735% stake) and Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS) (4.1735% stake) -- is responsible for the operation and management of the gas pipeline.  There are some indications that the CDB loan for the Myanmar-China Gas Pipeline Construction Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2020, CDB and the Government of Myanmar signed a debt suspension agreement as part of the G-20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between May 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under 5 loan agreements (as captured via Project ID#98030).  Debt service payments under these loan agreements were again deferred in 2021 (as captured via Project ID#98031). Then, in February 2022, the European Union announced sanctions against MOGE, claiming that military control of the company was 'contributing to its capabilities to carry out activities undermining democracy and the rule of law in Myanmar/Burma.' The EU sanctions led Bank of China to advise the operators of the Shwe oil and gas field in northwestern Myanmar (SEAOP and SEAGP) that it would not handle payments in euros to MOGE out of concern that it might run afoul of EU sanctions.","1. This project is also known as the Shwe Natural Gas Project and the Offshore Natural Gas Development and Pipeline Project/ Onshore Natural Gas Pipeline Project. The Chinese project title is 中缅油气管道 or 中缅原油和天然气管道. The Burmese project title is ေရႊသဘာ၀ဓာတ္ေငြ႔. 2. According to the Myanmar's House of Representatives, China Development Bank issued an EUR 86.16 million loan to MOGE to finance its investment in the Shwe Natural Gas project. The loan had a maturity length of 20 years, a 5-year grace period, and an interest rate of 4.5%. The EUR 452.75 million loan facility likely included the EUR 86.16 million loan (in order to facilitate MOGE’s acquisition of a 7.365% ownership stake in South-East Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited). 3. In the Overseas Development Finance Dataset that Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center published in December 2020, a $2.4 billion CDB loan for the ‘Sino-Myanmar Pipeline’ is identified. However, this appears to be a $2.4 billion umbrella agreement (signed on November 30, 2009) that subsequently resulted in two separate loan agreements for the Myanmar-China Gas Pipeline Project (captured in Project ID#34468) and the Myanmar-China Oil Pipeline Project (Captured in Project ID#73285) in December 2010. 4. South-East Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited (SEAGP) is responsible for the operation and management of the Myanmar-China Gas Pipeline Project. It is a joint venture between SEAP (50.9% stake), MOGE (7.365% stake), POSCO DAEWOO Corporation (25.041% stake), ONGC CASPIAN E&P B.V. (8.347% stake), Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL) (4.1735% stake) and Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS) (4.1735% stake).5. Some sources suggest that CDB issued the loan to Myanma Foreign Trade Bank, which in turn on-lent the proceeds to Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE). This issue warrants further investigation.  See https://eiti.org/sites/default/files/attachments/meiti_reconciliation_report_2017-2018_final_signed_31st_march_2020.pdf6. According to an FY16-FY17 EITI report (https://www.mopf.gov.mm/sites/default/files/4th%20MEITI%20Report.pdf), 'Posco Daewoo makes Royalty and Production Split payments to a Euro currency account, which has been opened by MFTB and China Development Bank (CDB) per a loan agreement. As per MOGE's explanation the agreement states that all revenue from the Shwe and SEAGP pipeline projects must be transferred directly to the aforementioned foreign currency account. According to MOGE, payments made to the Euro currency account are not transferred immediately to MOGE's MMK account at MEB due to a clause in the loan agreement that required a certain minimum balance. MOGE only receives payment into their MMK MEB account when MFTB issues Payment Orders. Therefore the amounts that are paid to the Euro currency account and the amounts that are transferred to MOGE's MMK account do not reconcile. MOGE had initially disclosed the amounts that they received in the MEB account for FY 16 - 17.'7. The amount outstanding data are drawn from EITI reports.

China Eximbank provides $69.3 million preferential buyer’s credit for 120MW Thaukyegat II Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#98029, 96221)

# Description
On January 20, 2010, the Government of Myanmar's Ministry of Electric Power No. 1 and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) signed a $77 million commercial (EPC) contract for the 120MW Thaukyegat II Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project. China Eximbank and the Government of Myanmar subsequently signed a $69.3 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the 120MW Thaukyegat II Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was to use the proceeds from the PBC to partially finance the EPC contract that was signed on January 20, 2010.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 120MW hydroelectric power plant — with three, 40MW power generation units (Unit 1, Unit 2, and Unit 3) — on Thaukyegyat creek in Taungoo Township and Kayin State. It involved the construction of a 94 meter high earth dam has created a reservoir that inundates 60 km2 and stores 444 hm3. The power plant is connected to Taungoo substation by a 230 kV transmission line.   CMEC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. However, the project was implemented on a BOT basis and a private firm called Gold Energy Company Limited is the project owner. The EPC contract went into effect and the project commenced in November 2010.

The borrowing terms of this loan were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, and a 4.5% interest rate. Then, on June 14, 2011, China Development Bank, Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC), and Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB) signed a loan agreement for Phase 2A and 3 of the Myingyan No. 1 Steel Mill Construction Project. The borrowing terms of this loan were as follows: a 21 year maturity, a 6 year grace period, and a 5% interest rate.   The precise face values of the 2010 and 2011 loans are unknown. However, according to a Government of Myanmar General Statistical Report and a Mandalay Regional Auditor General's Report (covering the period April 2018 to September 2018), total CDB disbursements for the project amounted to EUR 1,042,340,000 (EUR 566.97 million euros when the steel mill was under MEC ownership and EUR 475.37 million during the period when Myanmar’s Ministry of Industry was responsible for the steel mill).   The CDB loan repayment period for Phase 2 of the project runs from FY2015-16 to 2030-31. The CDB loan repayment period for Phase 2A and Phase 3 of the project is FY2017-18 to 2032-33. The total principal and interest outstanding under the two CDB loans was EUR 1.615 billion as of 2020.  The purpose of the project was to construct a steel mill — with the capacity to produce 400,000 tons per year of steel, steel products, construction materials, and machinery materials — near Sar Khar Village within Myingyan Township and the Mandalay Region (approximately 3.3 miles west of milepost 450/0 on the Yangon Myingyan Highway).   The project was implemented in three phases. Phase 1 commenced operations in March 2010 and it reportedly reached completion. However, it does not appear that Phase 2 or 3 (which were designed to produce value added products) ever reached completion. Responsibility for the steel mill was transferred from MEC to Myanmar’s Minstry of Industry on October 1, 2012.   There are some indications that the CDB loans for Myingyan No. 1 Steel Mill Construction Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. The mill was shuttered on February 17, 2017 because it was consistently losing money. Then, in 2020, the Acting Mandalay Chief Minister stated that the total project debt including interest exceeded EUR 1.615 billion. Consequently, the Government of Myanmar found itself in the position of having to pay 500 million kyats ($345,000) a day to CDB to service a loan contracted by a military-backed conglomerate (MEC) for a steel mill that was no longer operational. In 2020, CDB and the Government of Myanmar signed a debt suspension agreement as part of the G-20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI).

A consortium of companies was involved in the Shwe Gas Project, led by Daewoo. Over 2009 and 2010, a series of agreements were signed on constructing, operating and managing the Myanmar-China Oil and Gas Pipelines, which clarified the rights and obligations of the two joint ventures responsible for these pipelines: Southeast Asia Gas Pipeline Co. Ltd. (SEAGP) and Southeast Asia Oil Pipeline Co. Ltd. (SEAOP).  On March 26, 2009, the Chinese Government and the Government of Myanmar signed cooperative agreements to jointly develop oil and gas pipelines. Then, in June 2009, CNPC and the Government of Myanmar signed an MOU, in which the Government of Myanmar agreed to make CNPC responsible for the design, construction and operation of a 771 km Myanmar-China Crude Oil Pipeline.   On December 16, 2010, China Development Bank and Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) — a state-owned oil and gas company in Myanmar — signed an RMB 7.3584 billion loan agreement (ID#5300942322010591242) for the Myanmar-China Oil Pipeline Construction Project. This loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, and a 4.5% interest rate. An overseas euro currency account was established at Bank of China as part of the loan agreement with China Development Bank, and revenue generated by the oil pipeline project was to be paid into the account. The borrower was expected to maintain a minimum cash balance in the overseas euro currency account.  The borrower had made principal repayments worth RMB 913,580,000 and interest repayments worth RMB 1,516,220,000 as of March 31, 2018. The loan’s amount outstanding was RMB 5,116,000,000 as of March 31, 2017 and RMB 7,908,300,000 (RMB 6,444,820,000 million in loan principal and RMB 1,463,480,000 in loan interest) as of March 31, 2018.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 771-kilometer long Myanmar-China Crude Oil Pipeline from Madè Island on the west coast of Myanmar to Ruili in the southwestern Chinese province of Yunnan. The pipeline runs through Rakhine State, Magwe Region, Mandalay Region, and Shan State. It is 813mm in diameter and it was deisgned to deliver 12Mt/a upon completion of the project’s first phase, and 22Mt/a upon completion of the project’s second phase, with a total annual delivery of 2 million tons to Myanmar. The project also involved the construction of a 300,000-ton crude oil terminal with an annual capacity of 22 million tons. The Myanmar-China Oil Pipeline was designed to alleviate China’s dependence on the Strait of Malacca for its energy imports, giving it a shorter and alternate supply route from South East Asia.  Three CNPC subsidiaries -- China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering Co., Ltd. (CPP), CNPC Chuanqing Drilling Engineering Company Limited (CCDC), and Daqing Oilfield Engineering Co., Ltd -- were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. Construction of the pipeline began on June 3, 2010 was completed in 2014. However, the pipeline was not put into operation until April 10, 2017. The delay in the operational use of the crude oil pipeline was apparently driven by a disagreement over a 5 percent crude oil tax that the Government of Myanmar had requested that the Chinese Government pay in addition to the agreed transit fee and pipeline tariff.  The pipeline ultimately after the Government of Myanmar agreed to lower its transit fees, according to PetroChina President Wang Dongjin. However, even the start of operations was characterized by tension, as the Chinese Government dispatched a tanker to the pipeline before negotiations were completed.   Southeast Asia Oil Pipeline Co. Ltd. (SEAOP) -- a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of CNPC-SEAP (50.9% ownership stake) and MOGE (49,1% ownership stake) -- is responsible for the operation and management of the oil pipeline.  There are some indications that the CDB loan for the Myanmar-China Oil Pipeline Construction Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2020, CDB and the Government of Myanmar signed a debt suspension agreement as part of the G-20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between May 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under 5 loan agreements (as captured via Project ID#98030).  Debt service payments under these loan agreements were again deferred in 2021 (as captured via Project ID#98031). Then, in February 2022, the European Union announced sanctions against MOGE, claiming that military control of the company was 'contributing to its capabilities to carry out activities undermining democracy and the rule of law in Myanmar/Burma.' The EU sanctions led Bank of China to advise the operators of the Shwe oil and gas field in northwestern Myanmar (SEAOP and SEAGP) that it would not handle payments in euros to MOGE out of concern that it might run afoul of EU sanctions.","1.

It is a joint venture between South-East Asia Pipeline Company Limited (SEAP) (50.9% stake) and Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) (49.1% stake). Their joint venture, South-East Asia Crude Oil Pipeline Company Limited (SEAOP) is responsible for its operation and management.5. Some sources suggest that CDB issued the loan to Myanma Foreign Trade Bank, which in turn on-lent the proceeds to Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE). This issue warrants further investigation.

# Title
CDB provides RMB 7.3584 billion loan for Myanmar-China Oil Pipeline Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#34468)

# Description
In December 2008, CNPC signed a 30-year purchase and sale agreement with South Korean conglomerate Daewoo International on importing natural gas from offshore blocks A-1 and A-3 in Myanmar (a project referred to as the Shwe Gas Project). A consortium of companies was involved in the Shwe Gas Project, led by Daewoo. Over 2009 and 2010, a series of agreements were signed on constructing, operating and managing the Myanmar-China Oil and Gas Pipelines, which clarified the rights and obligations of the two joint ventures responsible for these pipelines: Southeast Asia Gas Pipeline Co. Ltd. (SEAGP) and Southeast Asia Oil Pipeline Co. Ltd. (SEAOP).  On March 26, 2009, the Chinese Government and the Government of Myanmar signed cooperative agreements to jointly develop oil and gas pipelines. Then, in June 2009, CNPC and the Government of Myanmar signed an MOU, in which the Government of Myanmar agreed to make CNPC responsible for the design, construction and operation of a 771 km Myanmar-China Crude Oil Pipeline.   On December 16, 2010, China Development Bank and Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) — a state-owned oil and gas company in Myanmar — signed an RMB 7.3584 billion loan agreement (ID#5300942322010591242) for the Myanmar-China Oil Pipeline Construction Project. This loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, and a 4.5% interest rate. An overseas euro currency account was established at Bank of China as part of the loan agreement with China Development Bank, and revenue generated by the oil pipeline project was to be paid into the account. The borrower was expected to maintain a minimum cash balance in the overseas euro currency account.  The borrower had made principal repayments worth RMB 913,580,000 and interest repayments worth RMB 1,516,220,000 as of March 31, 2018. The loan’s amount outstanding was RMB 5,116,000,000 as of March 31, 2017 and RMB 7,908,300,000 (RMB 6,444,820,000 million in loan principal and RMB 1,463,480,000 in loan interest) as of March 31, 2018.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 771-kilometer long Myanmar-China Crude Oil Pipeline from Madè Island on the west coast of Myanmar to Ruili in the southwestern Chinese province of Yunnan. The pipeline runs through Rakhine State, Magwe Region, Mandalay Region, and Shan State. It is 813mm in diameter and it was deisgned to deliver 12Mt/a upon completion of the project’s first phase, and 22Mt/a upon completion of the project’s second phase, with a total annual delivery of 2 million tons to Myanmar. The project also involved the construction of a 300,000-ton crude oil terminal with an annual capacity of 22 million tons. The Myanmar-China Oil Pipeline was designed to alleviate China’s dependence on the Strait of Malacca for its energy imports, giving it a shorter and alternate supply route from South East Asia.  Three CNPC subsidiaries -- China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering Co., Ltd. (CPP), CNPC Chuanqing Drilling Engineering Company Limited (CCDC), and Daqing Oilfield Engineering Co., Ltd -- were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. Construction of the pipeline began on June 3, 2010 was completed in 2014. However, the pipeline was not put into operation until April 10, 2017. The delay in the operational use of the crude oil pipeline was apparently driven by a disagreement over a 5 percent crude oil tax that the Government of Myanmar had requested that the Chinese Government pay in addition to the agreed transit fee and pipeline tariff.  The pipeline ultimately after the Government of Myanmar agreed to lower its transit fees, according to PetroChina President Wang Dongjin. However, even the start of operations was characterized by tension, as the Chinese Government dispatched a tanker to the pipeline before negotiations were completed.   Southeast Asia Oil Pipeline Co. Ltd. (SEAOP) -- a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of CNPC-SEAP (50.9% ownership stake) and MOGE (49,1% ownership stake) -- is responsible for the operation and management of the oil pipeline.  There are some indications that the CDB loan for the Myanmar-China Oil Pipeline Construction Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2020, CDB and the Government of Myanmar signed a debt suspension agreement as part of the G-20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between May 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under 5 loan agreements (as captured via Project ID#98030).  Debt service payments under these loan agreements were again deferred in 2021 (as captured via Project ID#98031). Then, in February 2022, the European Union announced sanctions against MOGE, claiming that military control of the company was 'contributing to its capabilities to carry out activities undermining democracy and the rule of law in Myanmar/Burma.' The EU sanctions led Bank of China to advise the operators of the Shwe oil and gas field in northwestern Myanmar (SEAOP and SEAGP) that it would not handle payments in euros to MOGE out of concern that it might run afoul of EU sanctions.",TRUE,NA,BROWN,HIGH,Oil and Gas Infrastructure,"Primary purpose is construction of oil pipeline infrastructure to transport crude oil, which increases fossil fuel dependency","771-kilometer crude oil pipeline, 12Mt/a capacity in first phase, 22Mt/a in second phase, 300,000-ton crude oil terminal"
