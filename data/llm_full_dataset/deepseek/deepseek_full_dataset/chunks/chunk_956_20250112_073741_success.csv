The purpose of this $2 billion loan facility was to finance large development projects in Africa between 2014 and 2024. The AGTF is sponsored by the PBOC and the administered by AfDB. Then, on November 19, 2015, AGTF signed an EUR 46,120,000 loan agreement (ID#5050130000151) with the Government of Tunisia for the Road Infrastructure Modernization Project. On the same day, the African Development Fund (ADF) of the African Development Bank (AfDB) issued an EUR 144 million loan (ID#5500155009352) for the same project. The AFDB also provided an EUR 1.2 million grant (ID#5500155009352) for the project through its Middle  Income Countries Technical Assistance Fund (MIC-TAF). Additionally, on November 15, 2016, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved an EUR 123 million loan for the project. The borrowing terms of the AGTF are as follows: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and an interest rate of 6-month EURIBOR plus a 0.6% margin. The first AGTF loan disbursement took place on March 9, 2016. As of the 2021, the AGTF loan had achieved a 75.13% disbursement rate.  The purpose of the Road Infrastructure Modernization Project (PMIR) is to complete actions embarked upon in the late 1990s to upgrade Tunisia’s classified road  network. PMIR seeks to rehabilitate 719 kilometers of classified roads, most of which are in the country’s inland  (West,  Centre-West  and  North-West)  governorates that,  unlike  the  coastal  regions,  are  less equipped  with  economic  infrastructure. One component of the project is the ""Permanent Link between Motorway A4 and the town of Bizerte in Tunisia,” which is a 9.5 km-long urban expressway (reference speed of 80 km/h) permanently linking motorway A4 to the town of Bizerte, including the canal crossing through a viaduct. The new infrastructure is a peri-urban expressway with interchanges of varying heights. Pedestrian traffic is forbidden on the main road, including on the viaduct. The project is sub-divided into three lots, namely: Lot 1: South Road: ""South road section. Interchange A4/ RN8 – viaduct"". PK0+000 to PK4+659. This road layout mainly follows a corridor on the outskirts of urban centres, bypasses Zarzouna and crosses Menzel Abderrahmen. The layout comprises three intersection points with interchanges of completely different heights. Lot 2: Viaduct: ""Viaduct with a mixed meshwork and combined double action deck"". PK4+659 to PK6+729. Lot 2 is an imposing 2,070 m-long viaduct that crosses the canal with three spans, the main 293 m-long span supported by two v-shaped single piers directing the navigation canal. Lot 3: North Road: ""North road section. Viaduct – RL348. PK6+729 to PK9+446"" is a 2.7 km-long road extension of this link beyond the viaduct to the north of the canal, like a northern bypass of the town, to improve access to the town of Bizerte.

The Gebze-Orhangazi-Izmir Motorway was a toll motorway project procured by the Turkish General Directorate of Highways under a Build, Operate, and Transfer (BOT) Model and is the largest BOT project in Turkey to date. It involved the construction of a 420 km motorway between Gebze and İzmir with 208 toll booths and a 3000-meter suspension bridge crossing İzmit bay. Upon completion, it was expected that the project would reduce travel times from Istanbul to Izmir from 8-10 hours to 3.5 – 4 hours. The starting point of the motorway is Gebze and it then crosses İzmit bay located between Dilovası and Hersek through a Suspension Bridge measuring 3,000 meters in length. It then extends to Orhangazi and Gemlik and is connected to Bursa Ring Road at the Ovaakça intersection. From the Bursa Ring Road, it continues onward to Balıkesir — starting at the Bursa - Karacabey intersection and continuing through the north of Susurluk. It then continues south from the west of Balıkesir — via the Savaştepe, Soma, Kırkağaç districts — and extends to the west near Turgutlu. It runs in parallel to the İzmir-Uşak state highway and finally connects with the Anadolu Lisesi intersection over the İzmir ring road.  On September 20, 2010, Otoyol Yatırım ve İşletme A.Ş.

Then, on October 28, 2010, the ceremony for the start of construction works in Gebze took place in the Dilovasi district of Kocaeli Province. A ceremony for the start of construction works in İzmir was held in Alsancak Cumhuriyet Square on February 27, 2011. Phase 1 of the project — a segment of the motorway that runs from Gebze (Muallimköy) intersection to the Altınova intersection and includes the Osmangazi Suspension Bridge — was opened to traffic on July 1, 2016. Phase 2A of the project — a segment of the motorway that runs from Gemlik Junction to Bursa Caglayan Junction — was completed and opened to traffic on March 12, 2017. Phase 2B of the project — a segment of the motorway that runs from  Kemalpaşa Junction to Saruhanlı Junction 01 — was completed and opened to traffic on December 1, 2018.
