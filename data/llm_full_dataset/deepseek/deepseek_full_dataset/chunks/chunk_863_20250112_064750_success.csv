This supplier's credit loan carried a 7% interest rate. The maturity was from the date when the loan agreement came into effect (October 17, 2016) until the date when funds became available to ZESCO Limited from a financial institution. ZESCO obtained financing from ICBC on January 26, 2017 (project #57560). Principal and interest was repaid immediately after ZESCO and ICBC signed the loan agreement. Therefore, the Sinohydro supplier's credit loan maturity was approximately 3 months or 0.25 years. In 2017, the balance stood at $16.9 million USD. It is unclear whether the full $29 million USD was drawn down.   The Musonda Falls Hydroelectric Power Plant is located in Musonda Falls within Mwense District and Luapula Province. It is a source of power supply to seven districts in the province—namely, Chiengi, Kawambwa, Mwense, Chipili, Chembe, Nchelenge and Samfya. The purpose of this project was to upgrade the Musonda Falls Hydroelectric Power Plant from 5MW to 10MW. This increase in local power capacity also added to the national grid capacity, thereby supporting the fishing industry, farming activities and potential mining activities in nearby communities.  In 2015, Sinohydro won the 18-month contract for project implementation. Sinohydro had previously provided another bridging loan in 2015 (see project #57565) for the same project.

The program was originally expected to be implemented over 48 months beginning in January 2017 at a cost of $150.57 million. At completion in 2020, the program was expected to benefit 639,927 people directly and an additional 287,212 beneficiaries  indirectly,  who live around  the  targeted  towns.  Residents  were expected to  gain  better  health  from increased access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation, and women and school going children were expected to  benefit  particularly  from  utilization  of  time  earlier  spent  on  collecting  water  for  income  generating activities as well as improved school enrollment and retention of girls. There were also expected benefits from employment/livelihood opportunities generated by the program, training of artisans (30% women) and empowerment of women and youth groups for possible business along the water and sanitation value chain and catchment management.

The Covid-19 pandemic has affected the pace of program implementation. All of the major works contracts were disrupted. The pandemic slowed down procurement of key materials as well as availability of key staff. Works on project sites slowed as public health regulations had to be adhered to in keeping with having less numbers of workers due to social distancing rules. The Government of Zambia had challenges in providing its counterpart contribution to provide compensation of project-affected person and resettlement. As of February 2022, all six major works contracts were underway with progress ranging from 5% to 23%. The program’s originally expected completion date was June 29, 2021.",1.
