This framework agreement (captured in Project ID#60219) was ratified on October 26, 2006.   Two of the subsidiary loans that were approved through the framework agreement included a $70 million loan in 2008 (captured in Project ID#57477) and a $10 million loan in 2012 (captured in Project ID#30497) for Phase 1 of the National Telecommunication Coverage Project. The $10 million loan agreement was signed on September 9, 2012 and it went into force on December 10, 2012. The estimated borrowing terms for these two loans are as follows: a 0.25% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, and a 5-year grace period. The proceeds from these two loans were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $100 million commercial contract for Phase 1.   Then, in 2017, China Eximbank and the Republic of Congo signed a $62,646,626.90 loan agreement (captured in this project, ID#57529) for Phase 2 of the National Telecommunication Coverage Project. This loan has a maturity length of 17 years, but its interest rate and grace period are unknown. The proceeds from this loan was to be used for the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $73 million commercial contract for Phase 2.   Phases 1 and 2 involved the construction of a fiber optic cable (“backbone”) network (measuring more than 3000 km in length) that connects the cities of Pointe-Noire, Makoua, Dolisie, Brazzaville, Oyo and Ouesso (through an underground fibre optic cable runs between Pointe-Noire and Ouesso and between Makoua and Ouesso and through an overhead cable that piggybacks on the National Electricity Company’s EHV electricity transmission lines linked to the Moukoukoulou and Imboulou hydroelectric dams); the construction of several additional fiber optic cable segments (“branches”) that connect to the backbone (a 130 km segment from Ngo to Djambala, a 70 km segment from Loudima to Sibiti, and an 80 km segment from Oyo to Boundji); and the construction of fiber optic cable loops around the cities of Brazzaville, Pointe-Noire, Oyo, and all of the country’s departmental capitals (measuring 700 km in length).   Alcatel-Lucent Shanghai Bell Co., Ltd., Huawei, and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) were the contractors responsible for the implementation of Phases 1 and 2.

72959,HEALTH,Chinese Government provides RMB 14 million grant for Phase 2 of Agricultural Technology Demonstration Center Project (Linked to Project ID#59183),"In 2008, China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) provided an RMB 40 million grant to Republic of Congo for the Agricultural Technology Demonstration Center Construction Project (captured in Project ID#59183). This grant commitment fulfilled a pledge that was first made at the 2006 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation.   This project, which is also known as Phase 1 of the Agricultural Technology Demonstration Center project, involved the construction of an Agricultural Technology Demonstration Center (ATDC) in the town of Kombé. The ATDC occupies an area of about 59 hectares and the project site had a total construction area of over 5,000 square meters. The construction of the ATDC included offices, training facilities, production facilities, housing accommodations. It also involved the creation of demonstration fields, the installation of irrigation facilities, and the procurement of agricultural machinery and equipment. The Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences was the contractor responsible for implementation. On September 21, 2009, a groundbreaking ceremony was held and attended by the Chinese Ambassador, the Congolese Minister of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, and technical experts from the Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences. Then, in April 2011, the project passed its final MOFCOM inspection. It was officially completed and handed over to the Congolese authorities on December 19, 2011.   Then, in 2012, China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) provided an RMB 14 million grant to Republic of Congo for Phase 2 of the Agricultural Technology Demonstration Center Project (captured in this project, ID#72959). Phase 2 involved the dispatching of Chinese agricultural experts to the ATDC to provide training and technical assistance — related to cassava, corn, vegetables, chickens, and other animals — to local officials, agricultural technicians, and farmers. Phase 2, which appears to have been financed with an RMB 14 million grant from MOFCOM, began implementation on January 1, 2012 and ended on December 31, 2014.","This project is also known as Phase 1 of the Agricultural Technology Demonstration Center Project.

Chinese Government provides RMB 14 million grant for Phase 2 of Agricultural Technology Demonstration Center Project (Linked to Project ID#59183)

# Description
In 2008, China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) provided an RMB 40 million grant to Republic of Congo for the Agricultural Technology Demonstration Center Construction Project (captured in Project ID#59183). This grant commitment fulfilled a pledge that was first made at the 2006 Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation.   This project, which is also known as Phase 1 of the Agricultural Technology Demonstration Center project, involved the construction of an Agricultural Technology Demonstration Center (ATDC) in the town of Kombé. The ATDC occupies an area of about 59 hectares and the project site had a total construction area of over 5,000 square meters. The construction of the ATDC included offices, training facilities, production facilities, housing accommodations. It also involved the creation of demonstration fields, the installation of irrigation facilities, and the procurement of agricultural machinery and equipment. The Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences was the contractor responsible for implementation. On September 21, 2009, a groundbreaking ceremony was held and attended by the Chinese Ambassador, the Congolese Minister of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, and technical experts from the Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences. Then, in April 2011, the project passed its final MOFCOM inspection. It was officially completed and handed over to the Congolese authorities on December 19, 2011.   Then, in 2012, China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) provided an RMB 14 million grant to Republic of Congo for Phase 2 of the Agricultural Technology Demonstration Center Project (captured in this project, ID#72959). Phase 2 involved the dispatching of Chinese agricultural experts to the ATDC to provide training and technical assistance — related to cassava, corn, vegetables, chickens, and other animals — to local officials, agricultural technicians, and farmers. Phase 2, which appears to have been financed with an RMB 14 million grant from MOFCOM, began implementation on January 1, 2012 and ended on December 31, 2014.",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,Social Development,Project focuses on agricultural technology transfer and training without clear environmental or energy transition impacts,"Agricultural technology demonstration center, training facilities, technical assistance for farming practices"
