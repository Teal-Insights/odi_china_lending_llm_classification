The final maturity date of the loan is December 28, 2031.   China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) provided buyer’s credit insurance for this loan, and when the upfront (lump sum) premium was reduced from its original estimate of $8,022,385 (as approved by Ghana’s Parliament on December 29, 2015) to $5,682,722.24, the face value of the loan was reduced to $88,132,722.24 (from its original value of $90,472,385) through a June 30, 2017 addendum to the June 28, 2016 facility agreement.

As of April 18, 2022, the loan’s total amount outstanding (including principal and capitalized interest) was EUR 84,788,048.33.   The purpose of the project is to improve the overall quality of mobile communication networks by building wireless mobile networks in rural area. It involves the provision of telecommunication infrastructure to towns and communities where Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) do not operate and deploy more than 2,016 telecom sites in 172 rural areas. Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. will deploy its ‘Rural Star’ solution to deliver voice and data services in remote communities. These services are expected to reach over 3.4 million rural residents, increasing Ghana’s national coverage rate for voice and data access services from 83% to 95%. The ‘Rural Star’ solution, which uses Relay Remote Node (RRN) wireless backhaul, is powered by solar energy and can be installed on a simple pole, making it around 50% cheaper to deploy than the microwave or satellite transmission typically used for rural connectivity. Once the rollout is complete, it is expected that mobile operators will be able to lease the network. The head of Ghana Investment Fund for Electronic Communications (GIFEC), Abraham Kofi Asante, has said that “[p]artnering with Huawei on this project…will ensure that all persons in Ghana are part of government’s digitization agenda, and improve the socio-economic wellbeing of people living in Rural Ghana.” Communications Minister Ursula Owusu-Ekuful has also noted that “[w]e selected Huawei as a partner in this rural network project as we have seen Huawei’s unremitting efforts in bridging the digital divide.”   On November 4, 2020, the first site was successfully launched by the President of the Republic of Ghana, His Excellency Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo at Atwereboana, a rural community located in the New Edubiase District of the Ashanti Region. The project was originally slated for completion in September 2021; however, some implementation delays have been encountered. In 2021, a total of 506 towers were erected out of the acquired 1,054 sites. Two network operation centers have been put into operation in Accra and Kumasi and 800 communities have been provided with broadband infrastructure. In 2022, the project will seek to reach 1,400 additional sites with voice and data services to ensure reliable, affordable, and secured broadband infrastructure across 12,000 rural communities.

It involves the provision of telecommunication infrastructure to towns and communities where Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) do not operate and deploy more than 2,016 telecom sites in 172 rural areas. Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. will deploy its ‘Rural Star’ solution to deliver voice and data services in remote communities. These services are expected to reach over 3.4 million rural residents, increasing Ghana’s national coverage rate for voice and data access services from 83% to 95%. The ‘Rural Star’ solution, which uses Relay Remote Node (RRN) wireless backhaul, is powered by solar energy and can be installed on a simple pole, making it around 50% cheaper to deploy than the microwave or satellite transmission typically used for rural connectivity. Once the rollout is complete, it is expected that mobile operators will be able to lease the network. The head of Ghana Investment Fund for Electronic Communications (GIFEC), Abraham Kofi Asante, has said that “[p]artnering with Huawei on this project…will ensure that all persons in Ghana are part of government’s digitization agenda, and improve the socio-economic wellbeing of people living in Rural Ghana.” Communications Minister Ursula Owusu-Ekuful has also noted that “[w]e selected Huawei as a partner in this rural network project as we have seen Huawei’s unremitting efforts in bridging the digital divide.”   On November 4, 2020, the first site was successfully launched by the President of the Republic of Ghana, His Excellency Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo at Atwereboana, a rural community located in the New Edubiase District of the Ashanti Region. The project was originally slated for completion in September 2021; however, some implementation delays have been encountered. In 2021, a total of 506 towers were erected out of the acquired 1,054 sites. Two network operation centers have been put into operation in Accra and Kumasi and 800 communities have been provided with broadband infrastructure. In 2022, the project will seek to reach 1,400 additional sites with voice and data services to ensure reliable, affordable, and secured broadband infrastructure across 12,000 rural communities.
