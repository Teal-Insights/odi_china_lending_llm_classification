According to the SBP, ‘these relatively high-cost [deposit loans] were mobilized in 1998 when Pakistan was facing acute shortage of forex reserves, and were thereafter rolled-over repeatedly.’ 2. Although the loan commitment took place between FY97 and FY98, AidData has coded the commitment year as 2000 because the loan was rolled over after its initial 2-year maturity.3. AidData has not yet created four separate records for the three $200 million rollover loans that were issued by Bank of China (due to the fact that their commitment dates and maturity dates could not be identified). This issue warrants further attention.","# Sector
