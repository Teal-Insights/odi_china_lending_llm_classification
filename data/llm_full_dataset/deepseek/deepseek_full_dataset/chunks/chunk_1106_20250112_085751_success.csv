30340,COMMUNICATIONS,China Eximbank provides $100 million preferential buyer’s credit for Phase 1 of the Nigeria National Information and Communication Technology Infrastructure Backbone Project (NICTIB) (Linked to Project ID#73385),"In November 2006, Galaxy Backbone Limited — a public enterprise of the Federal Government of Nigeria incorporated in 2006 with the primary mandate of setting up and operating a unified Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure platform that addresses the connectivity, transversal and other technology challenges — signed a $117 million commercial contract with Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd for Phase 1 of the Nigeria National Information and Communication Technology Infrastructure Backbone (NICTIB) Project. Nearly four and a half years later, in May 2011, China Eximbank agreed in principle to provide a $100 million preferential buyer’s credit to finance 85% of the cost of the commercial contract. Then, on January 5, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Nigeria signed a $100,000,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for Phase 1 of the Nigeria National Information and Communication Technology Infrastructure Backbone (NICTIB) Project (captured via Project ID#30340).   The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2.5% interest rate. The final maturity date of the loan (PBC) is September 21, 2032. As of December 31, 2020, Nigeria’s Debt Management Office (DMO) reported that the China Eximbank PBC (loan) had achieved a 100% disbursement rate ($100 million) and the borrower had made interest repayments worth $10.66 million and principal repayments worth $3.86 million to the lender. The loan’s (principal) amount outstanding, as of December 31, 2020, was $96.14 million. Under the terms of the PBC agreement, the Government of Nigeria was responsible for paying 15% of the cost of the commercial contract with Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd prior to project implementation.   Advance payment delays by the Government of Nigeria resulted in major project implementation delays. In December 2006, Galaxy Backbone Ltd made an advance payment of $10 million to Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. Then, in December 2013, the Federal Ministry of Finance of Nigeria — on behalf of Galaxy Backbone Limited — paid the remaining balance of the advance payment ($7.65 million) to Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd and officially requested that Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. commence project implementation.   The purpose of Phase 1 of the NICTIB Project was to build a 1482 km nationwide backbone network with fiber optic technology and connect up to 3000 Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) in over 3000 office locations nationwide. The first phase of the project involved the laying of fiber optic cable from Abuja to Onitsha to Lagos, and Onitsha to Port Harcourt to Uyo. More specifically, Phase 1 sought to install fiber optic cable from Abuja – Akwanga – Lafia – Makurdi – Enugu – Awka – Onitisha – Asaba – Benin – ore – Ijebu Ode – Lagos and also link from Onitisha – oweri – PH – Uyo. It also sought to establish Data Centers in Abuja and Metro access systems in cities like Abuja, Makurdi, Enugu and Lagos. Phase 1 was completed on or around August 3, 2018.   Then, on September 5, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Nigeria signed an RMB 2,300,000,000 ($328 million) government concessional loan (GCL) for Phase 2 of the Nigeria National Information and Communication Technology Infrastructure Backbone (NICTIB) Project (captured via Project ID#73385). The borrowing terms of the GCL are as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2.5% interest rate. The final maturity date of the GCL is March 22, 2038.   As of December 31, 2020, Nigeria’s Debt Management Office (DMO) reported that the China Eximbank GCL (loan) had not yet been disbursed and the borrower had not made any interest or principal repayments to the lender. The purpose of Phase 2 is to extend the fiber optic cable network to 19 states in Northern Nigeria. More specifically, the cable is expected to run from Abuja to Plateau, Gombe, Bauchi, Maiduguri, Kano and the rest of Northwestern Nigeria. Upon completion of Phase 2, it is envisaged that the fiber optic cable network will be 3441 km in length.   However, this project has encountered delays and implementation problems. In November 2022, Nigeria’s House of Representatives launched an investigation of the project, including a forensic audit of all relevant transactions to execute Phase 1 and Phase 2. The House of Representatives also urged Galaxy Backbone Limited and Nigeria’s Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning to ‘immediately halt all certificates of completion and payments, respectively, in lieu of the project, pending the completion of the investigation by the committee.’ These resolutions were based on the unanimous adoption of a motion issued by a legislator named Benjamin Bem. At the time, Bem noted that Nigeria’s Galaxy Backbone Limited, which falls under the authority of the Nigerian Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, signed an MoU with Huawei Technology Limited in 2018 to provide fiber infrastructure.

The PBC (loan) carries the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2.5% interest rate. The loan’s final maturity date is September 21, 2033. As of December 31, 2020, Nigeria’s Debt Management Office (DMO) reported that the China Eximbank loan had achieved a 57.14% disbursement rate ($562.47 million) and the borrower had made interest repayments worth $26.36 million and no principal repayments to the lender. As such, the loan’s (principal) amount outstanding, as of December 31, 2020, was $562.47 million. The borrower is expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 75% of a $1.293 billion commercial contract between the Government of Nigeria and a consortium consisting of Sinohydro and China National Electric Engineering Co (CNEEC), which was signed on October 19, 2012. The Government of Nigeria agreed to directly finance the remaining 25% of the commercial contract cost.   The purpose of the project is to construct a 700WM hydroelectric power plant — with four, 175MW power generators — on the Kaduna River in Niger State (exact locational coordinates: 9.90091, 6.28723). The project also involves the construction of a dam, electricity transmission lines, and associated substations to evacuate power from the dam. Upon completion, the power plant is expected to generate 2.64 billion kWh of electricity a year. The project is also expected to support flood control, irrigation, as well as water supply and fish breeding facilities. According to a ‘valuation report’ that was undertaken prior to implementation, the project would likely negatively impact 22,100 persons, 15,958 farmlands and 6,762 properties domiciled in 98 communities. Sinohydro and CNEEC are the contractors responsible for project implementation.   On May 28, 2013, a groundbreaking ceremony was held. Then, on January 22, 2018, the placement of the first silo of Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) took place. As of June 18, 2020, the Government of Nigeria’s Debt Management Office (DMO) reported that China Eximbank had disbursed 52.65% of the original face value of the PBC. By October 28, 2019, the project had achieved a 68% completion rate. The rotor of the first power generation unit was hoisted into place on September 30, 2021. Then, on March 28, 2022, the first (175MW) power generation unit went into operation. The unit was officially commissioned on April 1, 2022. However, the broader project has encountered major implementation obstacles and delays.   In 2015, the project stalled due to insufficient compensation of communities affected by the power plant (requiring resettlement) and litigation by aggrieved persons.  Nigeria’s then Minister of State for Power, Mohammed Wakil, confirmed the stoppage of the project in an interview. He said: ‘immediately [after] the Zungeru project took off, we had legal challenges. Somehow in the communities, some people, I can say powerful people instituted court action and in fact they succeeded in getting an injunction restraining government from further doing the project. […] At a point we had about two to three litigations on the project but the ministry has been trying to resolve the problems outside the court. A committee has been set up and they have held several meetings with the parties involved. It is a national project and we do not want to be unnecessarily bogged down by litigations. […] We are being careful and are engaging the parties with a view to settling out of court. That has tampered with our timetable but even with that there has been a lot of progress.’ Nigeria’s Director of Power, Sanusi Garba, said at the time that ‘you cannot pay 98 communities overnight. We have checks and counter checks at every point in time, and it is a slow and laborious process because you don’t want to pay someone twice and you don’t want to omit anybody.’   Then, in January 2022, three Chinese workers were abducted from the project site after a shoot-out that killed workers and police.  In March 2022, Nigeria’s Minister of Power, Abubakar D. Aliyu, said ‘[i]t’s unfortunate that the insecurity in some parts of the country has affected the delivery of the Zungeru Hydro Plant project because some persons were abducted by bandits and have not been released’.   The 700MW Zungeru Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project was originally scheduled for completion by the end of 2017.

China Eximbank provides $984.23 million preferential buyer’s credit for 700MW Zungeru Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project

# Description
On September 28, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Nigeria signed a $984.23 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the 700MW Zungeru Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project. The PBC (loan) carries the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2.5% interest rate. The loan’s final maturity date is September 21, 2033. As of December 31, 2020, Nigeria’s Debt Management Office (DMO) reported that the China Eximbank loan had achieved a 57.14% disbursement rate ($562.47 million) and the borrower had made interest repayments worth $26.36 million and no principal repayments to the lender. As such, the loan’s (principal) amount outstanding, as of December 31, 2020, was $562.47 million. The borrower is expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 75% of a $1.293 billion commercial contract between the Government of Nigeria and a consortium consisting of Sinohydro and China National Electric Engineering Co (CNEEC), which was signed on October 19, 2012. The Government of Nigeria agreed to directly finance the remaining 25% of the commercial contract cost.   The purpose of the project is to construct a 700WM hydroelectric power plant — with four, 175MW power generators — on the Kaduna River in Niger State (exact locational coordinates: 9.90091, 6.28723). The project also involves the construction of a dam, electricity transmission lines, and associated substations to evacuate power from the dam. Upon completion, the power plant is expected to generate 2.64 billion kWh of electricity a year. The project is also expected to support flood control, irrigation, as well as water supply and fish breeding facilities. According to a ‘valuation report’ that was undertaken prior to implementation, the project would likely negatively impact 22,100 persons, 15,958 farmlands and 6,762 properties domiciled in 98 communities. Sinohydro and CNEEC are the contractors responsible for project implementation.   On May 28, 2013, a groundbreaking ceremony was held. Then, on January 22, 2018, the placement of the first silo of Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) took place. As of June 18, 2020, the Government of Nigeria’s Debt Management Office (DMO) reported that China Eximbank had disbursed 52.65% of the original face value of the PBC. By October 28, 2019, the project had achieved a 68% completion rate. The rotor of the first power generation unit was hoisted into place on September 30, 2021.
