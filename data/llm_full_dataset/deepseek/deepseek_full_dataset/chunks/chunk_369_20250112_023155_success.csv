Then, in February 2020, several other development finance institutions (DFIs) joined the loan syndicate, including the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the Development Bank of South Africa, and Cassa Depositi e Prestiti Spa, an Italian development bank. The development institutions reportedly contributed to a $250 million, 7-year loan tranche, while the commercial banks (ICBC and Credit Suisse) contributed to a $350 million, 5-year loan tranche. The interest rates that applied to these loan tranches are unknown. However, it is known that the loan was secured by (i.e. collateralized against) receivables from future cocoa sales contracts.   The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance key components of its Productivity Enhancement Programmes (“PEPs”). The objective of the PEPs is to roll out a set of measures that will improve productivity per hectare and increase cocoa production levels well above 1 million tonnes per year (versus an average of 800,000 tonnes per year over the last ten years). The PEPs were expected to mainly entail measures to sustainably increase plant fertility; develop irrigation systems; rehabilitate aged and disease-infected farms; increase warehouse capacity; and create an integrated farmer database. The programs were also expected to provide short-term working capital support to local cocoa-processing companies, thus facilitating domestic value addition) and consumption of cocoa products in Ghana.   One source indicates that the loan proceeds were earmarked for the following purposes: $140 million for fighting Cocoa Swollen Shoot Virus Disease (CSSVD), $50 million for investing in COCOBOD's warehousing facilities, $200 million for processing cocoa locally and meeting the Government of Ghana's goal of processing 50% of the nations cocoa locally by 2022, $7.5 million for building a domestic consumer base, and $10.6 million for establishing a database of all cocoa farmers in the country.","1. According to a news release from the African Development Bank, the African Development Bank acts as the original development financial institution (DFI) lender and initial mandated lead arranger to the loan, Credit Suisse acts as the original commercial lender, the global commercial coordinator and the co-mandated lead arranger, while the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited London Branch joined the agreement as an original commercial lender, co-mandated lead arranger and joint commercial underwriter and bookrunner. Credit Suisse will also structure and fund the dual-tranche facility to the loan comprising of a $250 million, 7-year DFI tranche, and a $350 million, 5-year commercial tranche. 2.

To ensure the high quality of Ghana’s cocoa exports, the COCOBOD oversees horticulture practices and regulates the use of pesticides and fertilizer.
