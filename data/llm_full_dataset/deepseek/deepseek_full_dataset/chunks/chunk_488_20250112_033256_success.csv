The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance a commercial contract between the Government of Cote d'Ivoire and China National Building Material Group Co., Ltd. (CNBM), which was signed in March 2018.  According to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire’s Aid Management Platform (AMP),  the CFA 46,600,243,541.99 loan had achieved a 95% disbursement rate (CFA 44,309,365,638.48 out of CFA 46,600,243,541.99) as of December 31, 2022. ICBC made 7 disbursements between 2019 and 2022: a CFA 4,082,738,500 disbursement on December 31, 2019, a CFA 7,503,089,128 disbursement on January 31, 2020, a CFA 2,043,067,044 disbursement on February 28, 2020, a CFA 12,405,209,200.37 disbursement on June 30, 2021, a CFA 10,221,068,705 disbursement as of July 31, 2022, a CFA 4,613,413,768 disbursement as of July 31, 2022, a CFA 4,613,413,768 disbursement as of September 30, 2022, and a CFA 3,440,779,293.11 disbursement as of December 31, 2022.   According to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire’s AMP, a second loan — or bond issue contract (‘Contrat d'émission d'obligation Petrus’) — worth CFA 15,312,691,693.94 was issued by ICBC London to the Government of Cote d’Ivoire on December 13, 2018 in support of the San Pédro Stadium Construction Project and the Korhogo Stadium Construction Project. As of December 31, 2022, this loan (captured via Project ID#92251) had not disbursed.   The purpose of the Korhogo Stadium Construction Project is to construct a 20,000-seat stadium in the town of Korhogo (with a parking lot to accommodate 2,000 vehicles and water, sanitation, electricity, and fiber optic infrastructure), construct a 3-star hotel with 50 beds, construct 32 (4x8) villas (with 5 rooms each) to support 4 teams, and either construct or rehabilitate training grounds for athletes and local high schools (including the Dominique OUATTARA high school stadium and the HOUPHOUETBOIGNY high school stadium). Upon completion, the 20,000-seat stadium is expected to host the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations.  CNBM is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, Metallurgical Corporation of China (MCC) is also involved (most likely as a subcontractor). Construction began on or around May 19, 2019. However, the project has faced multiple problems and delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Construction was at a standstill for much of 2020. It finally resumed in the last quarter of 2020. Project implementation also suffered from insufficient manpower (only 250 workers). 400 additional workers from China did not arrive until November 2020.  Project implementation delays have also resulted from the Government of Cote d'Ivoire not paying CNBM in a timely manner (upon receipt of invoices). The project was originally scheduled to reach completion by May 13, 2021. However, as of April 2022, the project had only achieved a 70% completion rate.","1.

The purpose of the project is to construct the 231 km Odienne-Mali and Guinea border road (including the including the Salonkourani, Kaniasso, and Kuban ramps). The road consists of two sections: the Odienné-Mali border section (Pk42+000 to Pk 57+00) and the Kimbirilla Sud-Minignan section (Pk0+00 section to Pk 5+000). It passes through the following localities:  Odienné, Kimbirila-Sud, Samatiguila, Iradougou, Salonkourani, Kaniasso, Nola, Kéré, Minignan, Tienny, Djoronzo, Nafadougou, Kabangoue, Kemissiga, North Kimbirila, and Tiefinzo.

On June 1, 2019, CHEC began constructing living accommodations for construction workers at the project site (in Kimbirila-Sud, Kabangoué and Minignan). Then, on June 6, 2019, CHEC submitted a set of project design plans to BNETD for the Odienné-Mali border section and the Kimbirilla Sud-Minignan section. Construction began on March 2, 2020. According to the AMP, as of January 6, 2021, payment delays to CHEC had led to implementation delays. Five months later, on May 31, 2021, the Government of Cote d’Ivoire called upon CHEC to respect the project execution schedule specified in its contract. Then, on March 4, 2022, the AMP noted that CHEC was running 15 months behind schedule due to insufficient equipment (including graders, compactors, hydraulic shovels and dump trucks) and a lack of control of earthworks. The AMP also noted that the Government of Cote d’Ivoire had authorized the reassignment of the two road sections to new contractors. As of June 2022, the project had achieved 33% physical completion rate.
