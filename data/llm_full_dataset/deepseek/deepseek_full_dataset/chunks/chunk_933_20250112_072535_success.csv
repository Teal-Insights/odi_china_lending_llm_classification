96206,BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES,SBP makes RMB 10 billion drawdown under currency swap agreement with PBOC in Fiscal Year 2016,"On December 23, 2011, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) signed an RMB 10 billion (PKR 140 billion), three-year bilateral currency swap agreement to facilitate trade and improve foreign currency liquidity in Pakistan. The agreement was renewed on December 23, 2014 for a period of three years with overall limit of RMB 10 billion (PKR 165 billion). It was further extended on May 23, 2018 for another three years, with the amount being increased to RMB 20 billion (PKR 351 billion). It was again extended (renewed) on July 31, 2020, during the Government of Pakistan’s Fiscal Year 2021, with maximum drawing rights increased to RMB 30 billion (PKR 720 billion). During the Government of Pakistan’s Fiscal Year 2013 (July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013), the SBP made a (gross) drawdown under the currency swap agreement equivalent to RMB 5 billion ($819.35 million). The Fiscal Year 2013 drawdown (borrowing), which is captured via Project ID#89452, carried a 1-year (12-month) maturity and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin. The PBOC credited RMB 5 billion to the SBP’s account held with PBOC, and the SBP credited PBOC's account held with SBP with the PKR equivalent of RMB 5 billion (PKR 70 billion). The SBP reportedly used the funds that it borrowed from PBOC to address its balance of payments (BOP) needs. In late 2013, the IMF expressed concern about the SBP’s heavy reliance on short-term currency swaps and forward contracts to boost gross foreign exchange reserves, and recommended that they be gradually scaled back to limit risk.  The SBP made additional (gross) drawdowns under its currency swap agreement with the PBOC between Fiscal Year 2014 (July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014) and Fiscal Year 2022 (July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022): an RMB 6.5 billion drawdown in Fiscal Year 2014 that carried an estimated maturity of 9 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin, an RMB 10 billion drawdown in Fiscal Year 2015 that carried an estimated maturity of 4 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin, an RMB 10 billion drawdown in Fiscal Year 2016 that carried an estimated maturity of 4 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin, an RMB 10 billion drawdown in Fiscal Year 2017 that carried an estimated maturity of 4.5 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin, an RMB 20 billion drawdown in Fiscal Year 2018 that carried an estimated maturity of 7.5 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin, an RMB 20 billion in Fiscal Year 2019 that carried an estimated maturity of 7.5 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin, an RMB 20 billion in Fiscal Year 2020 that carried an estimated maturity of 7.5 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin, an RMB 30 billion in Fiscal Year 2021 that carried an estimated maturity of 7.5 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin, and an RMB 30 billion in Fiscal Year 2022 that carried an estimated maturity of 7.5 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin. The SBP reportedly used the funds that it borrowed from the PBOC between Fiscal Year 2014 and Fiscal Year 2022 to address its BOP needs. In Fiscal Year 2021, the SBP reportedly used the funds that it borrowed from PBOC to address its BOP needs and repay foreign debts (in particular, maturing debts to Saudi Arabia).   The Fiscal Year 2014 drawdown is captured via Project ID#96204. The Fiscal Year 2015 drawdown is captured via Project ID#96205. The Fiscal Year 2016 drawdown is captured via Project ID#96206.

A bilateral currency swap (BCS) agreement — also known as a central bank liquidity swap agreement — is an agreement between the central banks of two countries to exchange cash flows in different currencies at predetermined rates over a specified period of time. Central banks participate in these agreements to facilitate bilateral trade settlements using their national currencies (rather than relying upon on a third-party currency such as the U.S. dollar), manage demands from their local banks, and provide liquidity support to financial markets. The party that draws down on the swap line becomes the borrower and the other party becomes lender. During the term of the swap, the party that draws down on the swap line makes either fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amount. If both parties draw down on the swap line, then both parties exchange fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amounts. The 5-step process of drawing upon a currency swap line with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) can described from the perspective of an importer in a given country (‘Country X’) seeking to settle trade with a Chinese firm in RMB. Step 1: The central bank of Country X and the PBOC activate their currency swap in advance, at which point each party deposits a specific amount of its currency in an account controlled by the other party (i.e. the central bank of Country X deposits local currency in an account controlled by the PBOC, and the PBOC deposits an equivalent amount in RMB in an account controlled by the central bank of Country X). Step 2: A firm in Country X that imports goods from China applies for an RMB-denominated loan from a domestic bank. Step 3: The domestic bank in Country X that receives the loan application then applies to its central bank for an RMB-denominated loan. After a review process, the central bank of Country X notifies the domestic bank applicant that its loan application was approved. The central bank of Country X subsequently requests that the PBOC transfer RMB funds from the central bank of Country X’s swap account within the PBOC to the loan applicant’s account with a corresponding bank in China. Step 4: The domestic bank in Country X directs the corresponding bank in China to transfer RMB funds into a Chinese exporter’s account, and the corresponding bank in China provides RMB funds to the Chinese exporter. Step 5: The importer in Country X repays the RMB-denominated loan at its maturity date. The domestic bank notifies the central bank of Country X of the repayment, and transfers RMB into the central bank’s account within the PBOC through the corresponding bank in China. For the central bank of Country X, the RMB deposit is an asset that should be recorded on its balance sheet as an official reserve asset denominated in RMB. The contra entry of this asset is the liability in the local currency of Country X that represents China’s claims in the central bank of Country X. This should be also recorded on the balance sheet of the central bank of Country X. At the time of the exchange of currencies, it should be recorded as an increase in assets and an increase in liabilities of the monetary authorities in the balance of payments. The reason why the PBOC uses this mechanism to provide renminbi liquidity to other central bank is to increase the speed, convenience, and volume of transactions between the two countries. More detailed information about currency swaps with the PBOC can be found at https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021210-print-pdf.ashx and https://thechinaguys.com/the-rise-of-the-renminbi-the-reality-of-bilateral-swap-agreements/ and https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2017/pdf/17-25a.pdf.   2. AidData treats drawdowns under BCS agreements with the PBOC as collateralized loans because, in a BCS arrangement, the currency of the borrower is held as collateral while the lender receives interest on the amount drawn down by the borrower until repayment is made.   3. The precise maturity length that applies to the SBP’s FY16 borrowing is unknown. According to the SBP Fiscal Year 2016 Annual Report, ‘[t]he [SBP] has purchased CNY 5,000 million, CNY 1,500 million and CNY 3,500 million against PKR during the year with maturity bucket of three months and six months (2015: CNY 5,000 million, CNY 1,500 million and CNY 3,500 million with maturity buckets of six months, three months and two months respectively). These purchases have been fully utilized as on June 30, 2016 and the same amounts are outstanding as on June 30, 2016. Interest is charged on outstanding balance at agreed rates.’ AidData has coded the maturity length as 4 months (0.333 years) for the time being.   4. Most central banks publish their end-of-year outstanding PBOC swap debt, but only a few report detailed transaction-level data on drawdowns during the year. Therefore, if no information on drawings is available, AidData assumes that total drawdowns during the reporting period equal the amount outstanding at the end of the reporting period (and vice versa). Since the (de jure) maturities of PBOC swap drawings are 12 months or less, this creates a lower bound estimate for actual drawdowns under the PBOC swap line.   5. PBOC swap debt is frequently rolled over. In central bank reports where one can only observe the year-end outstanding amount, no distinction between rollovers and drawdowns is possible. In these cases, one can derive (new) drawdowns as the difference between the current and last year’s outstanding swap debt stock. This measure essentially captures net lending through the PBOC swap line.","# Sector

The independent power plant project (IPP) was located at Thar Block II, 25 kilometers from the city of Islamkot, near the village of Singharo-Bitra in the district of Tharparkar within Sindh Province. Thar Block II was a 95.5 square kilometer area of the Thar coalfield, which has total lignite reserves of 175 billion tons which can be utilized to produce 100,000 MW for over 200 years. The project will be fueled by coal supplied by Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC), which was developing a coal mine of 3.8 million tonnes per annum capacity beside the project (see Project ID#54315).   The total estimated cost of the 2 X 330 MW Engro Thar Block II Coal Power Project was $1.1 billion USD which was financed with 75% debt and 25% equity. Accordingly, the total equity requirement is $275 million. The majority of the equity investment for the project was expected to be from EPTL and its affiliates. IJGlobal reported that China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) invested $96.95 million USD (see Project ID#54316). In December 2014, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's (ICBC) Karachi Branch submitted an initial expression of interest to provide $825 million USD of debt financing for the power project. Then, a set of financing agreements were signed in Beijing on December 21, 2015 for both the power plant aspect (this project) and the mining aspect (see Project ID#54315). Under these agreements with EPTL, the 2 X 330 MW Engro Thar Block II Coal Power Project project was supported by a Pakistani rupee-denominated syndicated facility agreement from consortium of banks including: HBL, United Bank Limited, Bank Alfalah Limited, Askari Bank Limited, Soneri Bank Limited, Sindh Bank Limited, Bank of Punjab, MCB Bank Limited, Faysal Bank Limited, Pak Oman Investment Company Limited, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), National Bank of Pakistan, and Pak Brunei Investment Company Limited. The total syndicated loan is worth 17,016,000,000 Pakistan rupees.   Moreover, EPTL signed a bilateral facility agreement with National Bank of Pakistan worth 3,134,000,000 Pakistani rupees as well as Islamic facility agreements with three banks — Meezan Bank Limited, Faysal Bank Limited and Habib Bank Limited — worth 4,000,000,000 Pakistani rupees. All of these loans were repayable in 20 semi-annual installments commencing from the earlier of (i) first fixed date falling after 48 months since facility effective date and (ii) second fixed date falling after Commercial Operations Date (COD); where fixed dates are defined as first June or first December of any year and carries interest at the rate of 3 months KIBOR plus 3.5%.   On December 21, 2015, EPTL also signed a $621 million syndicated loan facility agreement with China Development Bank (CDB), China Construction Bank (CCB) and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). The borrowing terms of the syndicated loan facility are as follows: a 14-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 4.2% margin, and a 7% Sinosure insurance premium. The Government of Pakistan also provided a sovereign guarantee. As of December 31, 2018, EPTL drew down $504,731 against this facility. China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. In April 2016, a groundbreaking ceremony was held. The project reached its commercial operation date (COD) on July 10, 2019.   However, this project has encountered a number of revenue generation, debt repayment, and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. In May 2022, reports emerged that the Government of Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to EPTL. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 45 billion (approximately $225 million). Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this '[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Then, in May 2023, EPTL informed the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) that it might shut down operations entirely because of a 'severe liquidity crunch' that made it challenging for EPTL to settle its liabilities with both lenders and suppliers. Its outstanding receivables from the CPPA amounted to PKR 65.5 billion at the time. EPTL demanded the CPPA pay it PKR 28.7 billion before May 31, 2023 to help it avert a default on debt servicing.","1.
