The purpose of the Aiwo Kindergarten Building Construction Project was to construct a kindergarten building in the District of Aiwo that was designed to accommodate children between the ages of 3 years to 5 years. At the time that the project was approved, the nearest kindergarten to cater to these children is located in the District of Boe; however, due to the constant influx of children, from the neighboring districts as well as the rest of the island, the school was unable to accommodate a large number of children.

This issue requires further investigation.

The declaration also contained an undertaking by Nauru to close its embassy in Taipei within one month, despite the fact Nauru had never had a diplomatic mission in Taiwan. This move followed the PRC's promise to provide a large aid package. That same day, the Republic of China (ROC or Taiwanese) government issued an ultimatum, demanding that the communiqué be withdrawn within 24 hours or it would take the initiative and sever diplomatic ties. There was much dissension within the Nauruan government over the move by Harris, which the President was alleged to have made on his own initiative. In the confusion, the Nauruan government did not respond to the ultimatum, which was extended an additional 24 hours, and the ROC followed through with its threat on July 23, 2002, breaking diplomatic ties that had existed since 1980. Then, in 2003, the Government of Nauru closed its embassy in Beijing, prompting speculation of an imminent resumption of ties with the ROC. The Government of Nauru ultimately re-established diplomatic ties with the ROC in May 2005.
