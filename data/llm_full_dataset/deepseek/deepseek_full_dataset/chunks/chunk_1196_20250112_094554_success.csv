For the time being, AidData assumes equal contribution to the loan among the syndicate lenders, minus the Export-Import Bank of the Republic of China, which is known to have contributed $5 million to the loan. These individual contributions ($42,031,250) were derived by dividing the total amount loaned by the syndicate ($1.35 billion, minus $5 million, for a total of $1.345 billion) by the known lenders (32). The known lenders differs from the source's count of 31 banks, as AidData considers both ICBC subsidiaries to be separated entities for this purpose.","# Sector
