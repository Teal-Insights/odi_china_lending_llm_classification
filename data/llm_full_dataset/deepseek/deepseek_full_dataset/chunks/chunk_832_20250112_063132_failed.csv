Andrey Kruglov, Deputy Chairman of the Gazprom Management Committee, characterized this EUR 2 billion loan from Bank of China as a ‘bilateral loan facility agreement’. The Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal also characterized the loan as a bilateral agreement with Bank of China. However, it is possible that this loan was syndicated. Gazprom financial reports include a footnote next to Bank of China Limited, indicating that ‘loan received from bank syndicate, named lender is the bank agent.'3.
