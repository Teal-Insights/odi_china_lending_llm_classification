1380,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides $99.45 million preferential buyer's credit for 51MW Adama I Wind Farm Project (Linked to Project ID#30241),"On July 19, 2009, the Ministry of Finance of Ethiopia and China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) signed a $1 billion infrastructure cooperation agreement, which proposed 7 projects to be financed by China Eximbank through its preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) window. One of the projects that was identified was the Adama Wind Farm Project. One day later, on July 20, 2009, Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCO) signed an MOU with the Hydrochina-CGCOC JV (a joint venture between Hydrochina Corporation, and CGC Overseas Construction Co. Ltd. (CGCOC) to pursue the Adama Wind Farm Project in the form of a financing agreement and an EPC contract. Then, on September 22, 2009, EEPCO signed an EPC preliminary agreement for the 51MW Adama I Wind Farm Project with Hydrochina-CGCOC JV. Hydrochina Corporation subsequently undertook a project feasibility study and an environmental impact assessment with support from EEPCO’s wind study center. Then, on November 23, 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia's Ministry of Finance and Economic Development signed a $99,450,000 (ETB 1,646,523,179) preferential buyer credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC 2010 (31) TOTAL NO. (138) 1420303052010211538] for the 51MW Adama I Wind Farm Project. On January 21, 2011, the Ethiopian Parliament and the Prime Minister's Office approved the loan agreement. At the end of the same month, the Government of Ethiopia's Ministry of Finance and Economic Development signed an on-lending agreement with EEPCO. The loan officially went into effect on May 25, 2011. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The ultimate borrower (EEPCO) was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 85% of the total cost of a $117,994,500 commercial (EPC) contract [No. 33.20/12/09] between EEPCO and Hydrochina-CGCOC JV, which was signed on November 28, 2009.  The Ethiopian Government directly funded the remaining 15% of the commercial contract cost (approximately $18,544,500).   According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $99,450,000 (ETB 1,646,523,179) loan (PBC) achieved a 97% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 7 loan disbursements (worth ETB 1,603,194,607) between 2011 and 2017: an ETB 298,469,388 disbursement on July 7, 2011, an ETB 682,737,266 disbursement on January 8, 2012, an ETB 266,957,500 disbursement on July 7, 2012, an ETB 74,386,618 disbursement on October 10, 2012, an ETB 101,657,404 disbursement on January 8, 2013, an ETB 178,986,403 disbursement on July 7, 2013,  and an ETB 27 disbursement on November 15, 2017. The purpose of the project was to install a 51MW wind farm — with a total of 34 towers each generating 1.5 MW — on a site located 95 km east of Addis Ababa, near the city of Adama in Oromia.   Hydrochina-CGCOC JV was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, consultancy services were provided by the Addis Ababa University Faculty of Technology, while a Chinese firm called Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co., Ltd. (or ‘Goldwind’) provided the wind turbines for the project. The EPC contract went into effect on November 12, 2009. The project was originally scheduled to commence on November 12, 2009, and reach completion on December 31, 2010. However, construction did not begin until June 2011. Then, an installation and hoisting ceremony for the project's wind turbines was held on April 21, 2012. Construction ended in June 2012. Then, the wind farm began commercial operations in August 2012.  According to the CGCOC, the wind farm began full operations in September 2012. An inauguration ceremony for the first phase of the Adama Wind Project was held on December 1, 2012.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Adama I Wind Farm Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension).

China Eximbank provides RMB 172 million government concessional loan for Supply of the Container/Vehicle Inspection Systems Project

# Description
On May 24, 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed an RMB 172 million ($25.1 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL No. 2010 (28)] for the Supply of the Container/Vehicle Inspection Systems Project. The loan agreement was ratified by the Ethiopian House of Representatives in July 2010. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 2%, an 8-year grace period, and a maturity of 20 years. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance a commercial (EPC) contract with Nuctech Company, Ltd.    According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the RMB 172 million (ETB 319,880,975) loan achieved a 50% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 3 loan disbursements (worth ETB 158,564,244) between 2011 and 2013: an ETB 121,990,816 disbursement on July 7, 2011, an ETB 31,427,788 disbursement on January 8, 2013,  and an ETB 5,145,640 disbursement on April 8, 2013.   The purpose of the project was to help the Ethiopian Revenue and Customs Authority procure 51 pieces of customs inspection equipment for scanning imported containers and vehicles.   Nuctech Company, Ltd. was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation.  The implementation of the project commenced in December 2010 when the first batch of equipment deliveries arrived in Ethiopia. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s AMP, the project reached completion on January 11, 2013.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Supply of the Container/Vehicle Inspection Systems Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs.

34447,ENERGY,ICBC provides $420.75 million buyer’s credit loan for 1870MW Gilgel Gibe III Hydropower Project (Linked to Project ID#59363),"On June 20, 2010, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCo) signed a $420,750,000 buyer’s credit loan agreement for the 1870MW Gilgel Gibe III Hydropower Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are as follows: a 14.5 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, and a 3.067% interest rate. The Government of Ethiopia’s Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. The borrower also purchased buyer’s credit insurance from Sinosure. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a $495 million commercial contract between EEPCo and Dongfang Electric Corporation (DEC) for the electro-mechanical and hydraulic steel structure works component of the 1870MW Gilgel Gibe III Hydropower Project, which was signed in May 2010.  According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), 15 loan disbursements (worth ETB 21,904,463,534) took place between 2012 and 2019: an ETB 1,102,591,696 disbursement on January 8, 2012, an ETB 1,256,266,119 disbursement on April 8, 2012, and an ETB 241,864,376 disbursement on October 10, 2012, an ETB 519,482,004 disbursement on April 8, 2013, an ETB 149,053,030 disbursement on October 7, 2013, an ETB 1,120,000,000 disbursement on October 7, 2014, an ETB 323,232,323 disbursement on January 7, 2015, an ETB 450,503,881 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 200,679,002 disbursement on January 7, 2016, an ETB 286,223,972 disbursement on April 7, 2016, an ETB 164,701,197 disbursement on July 7,, 2016, an ETB 1,359,428,420 disbursement on April 7, 2017, an ETB 116,911,052 disbursement on July 7, 2017, an ETB 1,045,494,392 disbursement on March 20, 2018, and an ETB 13,568,032,070 disbursement on September 9, 2019.  The purpose of the project was to supply and install electrical and mechanical equipment (turbines) for the construction of the Gilgel Gibe III Dam (also known as the Gibe III Dam). The Gilgel Gibe III Dam is 610 m-long (2,000 ft) and 243 m (797 ft) high roller-compacted concrete dam. It withholds a reservoir with a capacity of 14.7 km3 (3.5 cu mi) and a surface area of 210 km2 (81 sq mi), collecting with a catchment area of 34,150 km2 (13,190 sq mi). The reservoir's live (active or ‘useful’) storage is 11.75 km3 (2.82 cu mi) and dead storage 2.95 km3 (0.71 cu mi). The normal operating level of the reservoir is 892 m (2,927 ft) above sea level with a maximum of 893 m (2,930 ft) and minimum of 800 m (2,600 ft). The dam's spillway is 108 m (354 ft) long and floodgate-controlled with a maximum discharge capacity of 18,000 m3/s (640,000 cu ft/s). Water above 873 m (2,864 ft) above sea level can be discharged through its gates. Feeding the dam's power house are two penstocks that each branch into five separate tunnels for each individual turbine. The power house contains ten 187 MW generators supported by Francis turbines for a total installed capacity of 1,870 MW.   DEC was responsible for the electro-mechanical and hydraulic steel structure works component of the project. Salini Costruttori S.p.A.(SPA), an Italian contractor, completed the civil engineering construction of the project.   The electro-mechanical portion of the project involved the design; build; site testing and commission of 10 vertical type hydraulic turbines; 10 vertical axis synchronous generators; and other transformer-related tasks. The hydro mechanical portion included the installation of steel structures; gates; a draft tube; a diversion tunnel; a spillway and ecological discharge gates.   The construction of the Gibe III dam began in July 2006 along the Omo River but the project provoked a backlash from environmental activists. The African Development Bank and the European Investment Bank were originally supposed to fund the electro-mechanical costs for the project, but they eventually backed out due to the project's perceived negative environmental and social impacts. In August 2015, Ethiopia commissioned the first phase of electricity generation at the Gibe III plant from three turbines with an output of 561MW. Then, on December 17, 2016, the Gibe III dam was officially inaugurated. The plant has 10 turbines each with a capacity of 187MW equaling a total capacity of 1,870MW, increasing Ethiopia's total electricity output to 4,238 megawatts. This project also reportedly created more than 7,000 jobs.  There are some indications that the ICBC loan for the 1870MW Gilgel Gibe III Hydropower Project  may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616).

The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023.","1. Some sources identify China Eximbank as the lender (funding agency), but this is incorrect. China Eximbank financed the Gibe III-Addis Ababa Power Transmission Lines and Substations Project (as captured via Project ID#59363 and #59365), which may be the source of the confusion.2. Some sources identify the project as a commercial loan, but based on OECD standards, the grant element of the loan exceeds 25%, so AidData has coded it as a concessional loan. 3. This project is also known as the Gibe III 10 X 187MW Hydropower Station Construction Project and the Gibe III Hydroelectric Project. The Chinese project title is 吉贝Ⅲ水电站 or 吉布3水电站. 4. Some sources suggest that the face value of the loan was $470 million and it was co-financed with Standard Bank. This issue warrants further investigation. 5. The total cost of the project was $1.75 billion. However, ICBC only financed 85% of the total cost of one component of the project (the electro-mechanical and hydraulic steel structure works component). 6.
