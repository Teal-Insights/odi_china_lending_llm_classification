The $450 million of loan financing authorized by IDB was designed to cover the total project cost.   The IDB approval date for the loan financing was November 13, 2013, and it refers to this project as ‘CR-L1032 : Infrastructure Transport Program (PIT)’.   The CHC loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 24-year maturity, a 6.5 grace period, a 0.75% commitment (credit) fee, no management fee, and an annual interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 0.07% funding margin (also known as the ‘Bank’s Cost of Funding’) and a 0.85% IDB lending spread.   The Infrastructure Transport Program (PIT) seeks to repair or pave up to 110 kilometers of the national road network, widen 51 kilometers of roads from two to four lanes, and build or repair 19 bridges and nearly 400 meters of breakwater in ports. These measures are expected to help reduce vehicle operations by 7 percent and travel time by 28 percent. It is also intended to decrease vehicle operating costs and increased road and port safety. The PIT is part of the National Transportation Plan 2011-2035 (Plan Nacional de Transporte 2011-2035) to promote the improvement of infrastructures in Costa Rica. For a full list of other PIT infrastructure projects funded by the IDB ordinary capital loan, see pages 43-44 in Alcance Digital No. 67.

The Limonal-Barranca section, 49.37 km, is being improved in order to facilitate the flow of trade between Costa Rica and the rest of the countries and regional economic integration. Work on this section includes adding expanding the road from two to four lanes, the reconstruction of the existing road, the rehabilitation and duplication of the 19 bridges located on the route and the construction of 6 interchanges or overpasses in the main intersections. It will also add safety elements (such as sidewalks, 14 pedestrian crossings, bicycle lanes, signaling and containment barriers), and environmental works such as slope stabilization and 39 wildlife crossings.

30857,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides $793.3 million preferential buyer's credit for Abidjan Autonomous Port Expansion and Modernization Project,"On December 6, 2014, China Eximbank and the Government of Cote d'Ivoire signed a $793,390,000 (CFA 423,630,219,153.44) preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2014) 43 TOTAL NO. (337)] for the Abidjan Autonomous Port Expansion and Modernization Project. The proceeds of the loan were then on-lent to the Abidjan Autonomous Port Authority (PAA). The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The borrower was also required to maintain a minimum cash balance of CFA 3 billion in an escrow account (accessible to the lender).  The proceeds of the PBC were used to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $933.4 million EPC contract between Abidjan Autonomous Port Authority (PAA) and China Harbour Engineering Co., Ltd. (CHEC), which was signed on January 11, 2013. The Government of Cote d'Ivoire was responsible for financing the remaining 15% of the commercial contract cost ($140,010,000). African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) also arranged an EUR 250 million syndicated bridge loan facility in 2014 for this project.  According to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), China Eximbank made 15 loan disbursements (worth CFA 459,375,056,353) between 2015 and 2020: a CFA 71,405,100,000 disbursement on September 30, 2015, a CFA 48,843,381,789 disbursement on April 30, 2016, a CFA 5,293,017,891 disbursement on June 30, 2016, a CFA 8,388,694,167 disbursement on October 31, 2016, a CFA 3,281,002,542 disbursement on November 30, 2016, a CFA 50,318,912,478 disbursement on December 31, 2016, a CFA 60,326,378,065 disbursement on December 31, 2017, a CFA 75,857,838,185 disbursement on October 31, 2018, a CFA 24,960,426,152 disbursement on May 31, 2019, a CFA 6,247,765,605 disbursement on September 30, 2019, a CFA 17,886,499,596 disbursement on October 31, 2019, a CFA 12,392,163,528 disbursement on December 31, 2019, a CFA 7,423,281,737 disbursement on March 31, 2020, a CFA 5,517,839,600 disbursement on April 30, 2010, and a CFA 61,232,755,018 disbursement on June 30, 2020.  The project involved the enlargement of the Vridi canal (a link from Abidjan to the Atlantic Ocean), the construction of a second container terminal, and a roll-on/roll-off terminal. It was expected to start in the first quarter of 2015 and reach completion by 2021.   CHEC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on October 6, 2015. The roll-on/roll-off terminal was finished at some point in 2018. On February 21, 2019, the enlargement of Vridi Canal was officially completed and handed over to the Government of Cote d'Ivoire. The project as a whole was officially completed on April 23, 2020, and a certificate of final acceptance was issued by the project owner in July 2021. However, the construction of the second container terminal was not completed until November 25, 2022. The modern container terminal, roll-on/roll-off terminal, jetties, and approach channels that were expanded and improved with financing from China Eximbank have reportedly increased the cargo handling capacity and efficiency of the port.  This project suffered from major cash flow problems. According to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), PAA had payment arrears to CHEC worth CFA 186 billion (China Eximbank share: CFA 165 billion; PAA share: CFA 21 billion) as of November 14, 2017. The AMP also notes that, as of November 14, 2017, the project was generating large financial outflows but it was not expected to generate revenue until 2020. To increase PAA’s revenue-generation capacity, the Ivorian authorities considered putting in place a special tax and customs regime (in accordance with Articles 4 and 43 of the PAA statutes) from 2020 to 2035. It is unclear if they ultimately did so. The Government of Cote d'Ivoire and PAA also secured an EUR 10,641,840 agreement with Matha Capital, JP Morgan, Société Générale Paris, and Ecobank to hedge its foreign exchange (USD/CFA) risk on its outstanding debt to China Eximbank for the Abidjan Autonomous Port Expansion and Modernization Project.","1.
