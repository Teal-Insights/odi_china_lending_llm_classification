The loan had disbursed as of March 31, 2009. China Eximbank issued two subsequent loans for the project’s second phase: an RMB 20 million loan and a $17.76 million loan. Thai-Chinese Rayong Industrial Park Development Co., Ltd.(泰中罗勇工业园开发有限公司) — a  joint venture of China’s Holley Group Company Limited and Thailand’s Amata Group — was established in 2005 to manage the development of the Thai-Chinese Rayong Industrial Zone, which is located in the town of Si Racha within the Si Racha sub-district near the Laem Chabang deep-water port. The industrial zone occupies 12 square kilometers, including a general industrial zone, bonded zone, logistics and storage zone, and commercial living zone.  The planned investment from China’s Holley Group Company Limited and Thailand’s Amata Group was $200 million. The actual level of investment during Phase 1 was $196 million. Phase 2 was completed in 2010. As of May 2014, there were 56 enterprises working from the Thai-Chinese Rayong Industrial Zone (source: 泰中罗勇工业园). As of 2019, Thai-Chinese Rayong Industrial Zone served 118 Chinese multinational companies and employed 3,000 Chinese and 32,000 Thais, with revenue of more than $3.5 billion. Chinese companies there produce motorcycles, auto parts, oil exploration pipelines, solar cells, construction of factories and dormitories, among other mechanical and electrical products. The RMB-denominated loan for Phase 1 is captured via Project ID#64410.

This project is also known as Phase 1 of Luoyong Industrial Zone Construction Project. The Chinese project title is 泰中罗勇工业园. 2. The commitment year for the Phase 1 loan is currently set to 2006 because China Eximbank claims that it provided financing for the construction of the project beginning in 2006 (see https://zjnews.zjol.com.cn/zjnews/201608/t20160815_1847069.shtml). According to China Eximbank, it has financially supported 7 of the 17 Zhejiang enterprises that are operating out of the Thai-Chinese Rayong Industrial Zone. This issue merits further investigation. 3. The Thai-Chinese Rayong Industrial Zone is a ‘mini’ industrial park in Amata City Rayong Industrial Estate. 4. The second phase of the project was implemented in 2010, so AidData assumes that the first phase was completed.
