However, the project in Kosrae for which these funds were allocated ""was never consummated or implemented.""   The specific road improvement project(s) to be financed via the USD 5 million allocated in March 2020 are unknown.

It is unknown if the project that captures the original commitment of the funds is already captured in AidData's dataset. This issue warrants further investigation.2. This project may be funded via one or several Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreements (ETCA). This is for several reasons. First, the resolution itself references 'grants' (plural) from the Chinese government that are being pulled from. Second, grants that are unallocated or partially allocated when committed, but later allocated to specific infrastructure projects, are a common financing mechanism associated with ETCAs. Third, there are several ETCAs that were signed by FSM and China for which no evidence about their subsequent allocation exists.

There is a risk that the grant captured in this project is being double counted if the original grant from the Chinese government is both (1) in the TUFF dataset and (2) not coded as an umbrella project. However, the chance that the funds referenced were granted via an ETCA (which AidData codes as umbrella projects) is fairly high. Further, if this projects was not funded via an ETCA or similar umbrella grant, AidData cannot identify a project in the TUFF database that is a uniquely likely candidate for the provision of the original funds: a non-ETCA grant which is related to infrastructure construction/sufficiently general to include infrastructure construction, but which is also unallocated to a specific project and/or allocated to a Kosrae State or infrastructure project that never took place. Project ID#69215 and ID#67602 are the only two projects that meet these criteria, and the former is a grant of only 250,000 USD from 2005, while the later is very likely an ETCA.

94666,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,Chinese government commits four years of technical assistance for Hapilmohol-2 passenger and cargo vessel (Linked to Project ID#90070),"On March 11, 2020, the Twenty-First Congress of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) approved a resolution (C.R. No. 21-95, C.D. 1, C.D. 2) allocating USD 10 million of funds previously granted by the Chinese Government for the acquisition of a new vessel for the State of Yap.  Then, on October 15, 2020, the Micronesian Secretary of Transportation and the Chinese Ambassador to Micronesia, on behalf of their respective governments, signed a contract for the implementation of the Passenger and Cargo Vessel Project. This project would involve the construction of a new 600-tonne class cargo and passenger ship: Hapilmohol-2 (H-2). The grant for the ship itself is captured via Project ID#90070.  The October 15, 2020 contract also included a technical assistance component captured via Project ID#94666. The agreement stated that, starting from the second year after the ship’s delivery, upon the conclusion of its one-year warranty period, China would be responsible for dispatching four technicians to the FSM once a year. These technicians would carry out a 14-day technical inspection and maintenance on the ship. This would occur for four consecutive years.  Originally, the ship was expected to sail from China to Yap 390 days from the signing of the contract, or around November 15, 2021. However, the handover ceremony of this project did not take place until June 28, 2022. Ambassador Huang Zhen and the Micronesian Minister of Transportation signed the formal handover documents. The ship subsequently was to be handed over by the national government to the Yap State government.   Thus, it is expected that the technical team will arrive first on or about June 28, 2023 and will be finished with their contractual obligations on or about July 12, 2026.  H-2 is intended primarily to connect the State of Yap and will serve as a replacement for the aging Hapilmohol-1 (H-1), which had previously been granted by the Chinese government in 2007 (captured via Project ID#40029). The ship is expected to increase Micronesia's maritime transport capacity, stimulate the flow of people and goods, better assist the citizens of Yap dispersed throughout the outer islands, and provide nation-wide services as necessary. China and FSM jointly participated in the ship's design.   The ship's construction was undertaken by an unspecified Chinese manufacturer. The implementation contract further specified that the ship would have a designed cruising range of no less than 2,500 nautical miles and an endurance of no less than fifteen days.","1. Predicted implementation start and end dates are based off the specifications from the October 15, 2020 contract: one year from the ship's actual arrival (i.e. the end of the one year warranty period) is June 28, 2023. The fourth consecutive year of maintenance checks would begin June 28, 2026, counting 2023 as the first year. The end of the 14 day maintenance period, and thus the end of the technical assistance project, would therefore land on July 12, 2026.","# Sector
