Then, in 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of Niger signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due in 2021 under one or more loan agreements. The total estimated suspension amount was $10,747,000 ($7,862,000 in principal payments and $2,886,000 in interest payments). However, at the time that the parties signed the debt suspension agreement, they both acknowledged that the total suspension amount would ultimately be determined at the end of the suspension period (since loan disbursements could be made during the suspension period and the lender agreed to suspend the payment of interest accrued on any disbursements during the suspension period).

The agreement was renewed on June 9, 2021 for a period of three years with an overall limit of RMB 15 billion (NGN 967 billion). During 2018, the CBN made drawdowns (via 12 bi-weekly auctions) under the currency swap agreement equivalent to RMB 669.66 million.

The 2019 borrowing is captured via Project ID#89449. The 2020 borrowing is captured via Project ID#89450. The 2021 borrowing is captured via Project ID#89451.","1. A bilateral currency swap (BCS) agreement — also known as a central bank liquidity swap agreement — is an agreement between the central banks of two countries to exchange cash flows in different currencies at predetermined rates over a specified period of time. Central banks participate in these agreements to facilitate bilateral trade settlements using their national currencies (rather than relying upon on a third-party currency such as the U.S. dollar), manage demands from their local banks, and provide liquidity support to financial markets. The party that draws down on the swap line becomes the borrower and the other party becomes lender. During the term of the swap, the party that draws down on the swap line makes either fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amount. If both parties draw down on the swap line, then both parties exchange fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amounts.  The 5-step process of drawing upon a currency swap line with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) can described from the perspective of an importer in a given country (‘Country X’) seeking to settle trade with a Chinese firm in RMB. Step 1: The central bank of Country X and the PBOC activate their currency swap in advance, at which point each party deposits a specific amount of its currency in an account controlled by the other party (i.e. the central bank of Country X deposits local currency in an account controlled by the PBOC, and the PBOC deposits an equivalent amount in RMB in an account controlled by the central bank of Country X). Step 2: A firm in Country X that imports goods from China applies for an RMB-denominated loan from a domestic bank. Step 3: The domestic bank in Country X that receives the loan application then applies to its central bank for an RMB-denominated loan. After a review process, the central bank of Country X notifies the domestic bank applicant that its loan application was approved. The central bank of Country X subsequently requests that the PBOC transfer RMB funds from the central bank of Country X’s swap account within the PBOC to the loan applicant’s account with a corresponding bank in China. Step 4:  The domestic bank in Country X directs the corresponding bank in China to transfer RMB funds into a Chinese exporter’s account, and the corresponding bank in China provides RMB funds to the Chinese exporter. Step 5: The importer in Country X repays the RMB-denominated loan at its maturity date. The domestic bank notifies the central bank of Country X of the repayment, and transfers RMB into the central bank’s account within the PBOC through the corresponding bank in China. For the central bank of Country X, the RMB deposit is an asset that should be recorded on its balance sheet as an official reserve asset denominated in RMB. The contra entry of this asset is the liability in the local currency of Country X that represents China’s claims in the central bank of Country X. This should be also recorded on the balance sheet of the central bank of Country X. At the time of the exchange of currencies, it should be recorded as an increase in assets and an increase in liabilities of the monetary authorities in the balance of payments. The reason why the PBOC uses this mechanism to provide renminbi liquidity to other central bank is to increase the speed, convenience, and volume of transactions between the two countries. More detailed information about currency swaps with the PBOC can be found at https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021210-print-pdf.ashx and https://thechinaguys.com/the-rise-of-the-renminbi-the-reality-of-bilateral-swap-agreements/ and https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2017/pdf/17-25a.pdf. 2. AidData treats drawdowns under BCS agreements with the PBOC as collateralized loans because, in a BCS arrangement, the currency of the borrower is held as collateral while the lender receives interest on the amount drawn down by the borrower until repayment is made.3. Most central banks publish their end-of-year outstanding PBOC swap debt, but only a few report detailed transaction-level data on drawdowns during the year. Therefore, if no information on drawings is available, AidData assumes that total drawdowns during the reporting period equal the amount outstanding at the end of the reporting period (and vice versa). Since the (de jure) maturities of PBOC swap drawings are 12 months or less, this creates a lower bound estimate for actual drawdowns under the PBOC swap line.  4. PBOC swap debt is frequently rolled over. In central bank reports where one can only observe the year-end outstanding amount, no distinction between rollovers and drawdowns is possible. In these cases, one can derive (new) drawdowns as the difference between the current and last year’s outstanding swap debt stock. This measure essentially captures net lending through the PBOC swap line.","# Sector

Then, on January 28, 2021, AGTF signed a $50 million loan agreement  with the Government of Nigeria for the Nigeria Transmission Expansion Project (NTEP1). On the same day, the African Development Bank (AfDB) issued a $160 million loan to the Government of Nigeria for the same project. The borrowing terms of the AGTF loan are as follows: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 0.8% margin, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% upfront (management) fee.    The AfDB and AGTF loan proceeds were then on-lent to the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), which is a state-owned company that manages Nigeria’s electricity transmission network. The project consists of brownfield and greenfield subcomponents, and aims at strengthening and improving the grid wheeling capacity where the transmission lines are the most constrained.   The project will support power infrastructure in the following states: Abia, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Imo, Kaduna, and Kano. More specifically, the project involves (i) the reconstruction of two (2) 330kV double circuit quad transmission lines, 138km Alaoji–Onitsha and 125km Delta–Benin; (ii) the construction of one (1) 330kV double circuit quad transmission line, 204km Kaduna–Kano; (iii) the construction of two (2) 330/132kV, 2 x 150MVA Sub stations at Zaria and Millennium City; and (iv) the construction of two (2) 132/33kV, 2x 60MVA Substations at Rigasa and Jaji, respectively.

The purpose of this $2 billion loan facility was to finance large development projects in Africa between 2014 and 2024. The AGTF is sponsored by the PBOC and the administered by AfDB. Then, on January 28, 2021, AGTF signed a $50 million loan agreement  with the Government of Nigeria for the Nigeria Transmission Expansion Project (NTEP1). On the same day, the African Development Bank (AfDB) issued a $160 million loan to the Government of Nigeria for the same project. The borrowing terms of the AGTF loan are as follows: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 0.8% margin, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% upfront (management) fee.    The AfDB and AGTF loan proceeds were then on-lent to the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN), which is a state-owned company that manages Nigeria’s electricity transmission network. The project consists of brownfield and greenfield subcomponents, and aims at strengthening and improving the grid wheeling capacity where the transmission lines are the most constrained.   The project will support power infrastructure in the following states: Abia, Anambra, Delta, Edo, Imo, Kaduna, and Kano. More specifically, the project involves (i) the reconstruction of two (2) 330kV double circuit quad transmission lines, 138km Alaoji–Onitsha and 125km Delta–Benin; (ii) the construction of one (1) 330kV double circuit quad transmission line, 204km Kaduna–Kano; (iii) the construction of two (2) 330/132kV, 2 x 150MVA Sub stations at Zaria and Millennium City; and (iv) the construction of two (2) 132/33kV, 2x 60MVA Substations at Rigasa and Jaji, respectively. The project also involves the provision of capacity  building  and  technical  assistance  in  the  form  of consultancy services, training and engineering support in order to improve TCN’s performance and management, and the technical  capacity for the implementation support for  this project and those comparable in future.
