BOC contributed $260 million to the syndicated loan (captured via Project ID#65937). The loan carries a 13-year maturity, but its interest rate and grace period are unknown. The Vietnamese Ministry of Finance provided a sovereign guarantee for the loan and Sinosure provided buyer’s credit insurance.   Then, on February 25, 2012, the Export-Import Bank of China issued a buyer’s credit loan worth approximately RMB 200 million for the same project (captured via Project #73296). This loan reportedly carried a maturity of 3 years and an interest rate of 3.51%. Sinosure also provided buyer’s credit insurance for this loan. The Export-Import Bank of Vietnam also provided a $56 million loan — with a 13-year maturity, 3-year grace period, and 4.5-4.8% interest rate — for the project.
