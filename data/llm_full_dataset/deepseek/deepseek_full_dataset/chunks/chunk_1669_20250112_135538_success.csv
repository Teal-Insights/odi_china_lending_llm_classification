34772,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides $12.5 million buyer’s credit loan for Bus Transport Project (Linked to Project ID#42029),"On November 28, 2003, the Chinese Government and the Angolan Government signed a framework agreement pertaining to a special economic cooperation arrangement (Agreement name in Chinese: 中华人民共和国商务部与安哥拉共和国财政部关于两国经贸合作特殊安排的框架协议).  Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility, carried the following borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections. The process was managed by an office in the Angolan Ministry of Finance -- known as Gabinete de Apoio Técnico (GAT) -- that was specifically created to manage the MLFA with China Eximbank.  On August 9, 2004, the Government of Angola signed a commercial contract worth $13,840,468.00 with an unidentified firm for a Bus Transport Project. China Eximbank issued a subsidiary buyer’s credit loan agreement to support this project.  AidData assumes that the face value of the loan was equivalent to 90% of the value of the commercial contract ($12,456,421) since other subsidiary loans under the MLFA supported 90% of commercial contract costs.  The purpose of this project was to acquire 250 buses.  Of these 250 vehicles, 189 were assigned to 'former combatants,' 23 were assigned 'for distribution,' 25 were assigned to the 'Military House,' 10 were reserved, and 3 were assigned for 'special cases'.

The project may have been partially financed by a China International Fund (CIF) loan facility (see Project ID#54 and 'Diversification and Development, or 'White Elephants'? Transport in Angola’s Lobito Corridor,' p. 5). CIF initially agreed to finance the construction of both the Luanda and Benguela railways in 2005, but subsequent delays in construction due to disputes between CR20 and Angola administrators may have led to a change in the financing arrangements (See: 'Progress in reconstructing the rail network is slow').3. The total cost of the project was $1.83 billion, but it is not clear how the Government of Angola funded the portion of the project that was not supported from the proceeds of the China Eximbank loan.
