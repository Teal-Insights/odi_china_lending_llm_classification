41233,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,Chinese state-owned banks provide $269 million syndicated buyer’s credit for Tehran Metro Line 1 Construction Project,"On November 24, 2002, 14 Chinese banks — including Bank of China, China Construction Bank, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, China Eximbank, China Everbright Bank, Huaxia Bank Co., Ltd., and China CITIC Bank — issued a $269 million syndicated buyer’s credit loan agreement with Bank Tejarat of Iran for the Tehran Metro Line 1 Construction Project. China CITIC Bank contributed $50 million to the syndicate. Bank of China contributed $994,672.71. The individual contributions of the other Chinese banks are unknown. The loan was insured (mostly likely by Sinosure) and it carried the following borrowing terms: an 8-year maturity, a 3-year grace period, a 0.35% management fee, a 0.15% commitment fee, and an annual interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (1.461% in November 2002) plus a 1.25% margin. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $323 commercial (EPC) contract between Tehran Urban and Suburban Railway Company (TUSRC or 德黑兰城郊铁路公司) and China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC), which was signed in November 2002.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 8.2 kilometer section of Tehran Metro Line 1 from Mirdamad Boulevard (Mirdamad metro station or ایستگاه مترو میرداماد) to Ghods Square (Tajrish metro station or ایستگاه مترو تجریش) and supply 105 metro cars (passenger wagons). The 8.2 kilometer section includes 7 metro stations and it is known as the U1-W1 section. The project was designed and implemented in two phases.

The next day, Mirdamad metro station, which is located next to Mirdamad Boulevard, was opened. Then, on December 13, 2009, the U1-W1 railway section was put into trial operation.
