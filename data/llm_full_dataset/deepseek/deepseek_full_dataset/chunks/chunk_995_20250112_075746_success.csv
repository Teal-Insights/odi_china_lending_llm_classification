'2017' will not show this project, meaning it must have been completed in 2018.No source explicitly links Georgia's Ministry of Internally Displaced Persons from the Occupied Territories, Health, Labour and Social Affairs to this project. However, the latter RMB 60 million grant involved that agency (see '李小兵局长率组赴格鲁吉亚商谈援格心理健康医院项目实施协议并考察建设场址' for example). Seeing that this project appears to be associated with that, AidData has assumed the ministry was involved in this one and has coded it accordingly. AidData has coded the funding agency as MOFCOM as it is the sole administrator of China’s interest-free loan program. The sources that underpin this project record suggest that China Development Bank was the funding agency. However, this very likely reflects the fact that MOFCOM disbursed the loan through a bank account that the borrower established with China Development Bank.","# Sector
