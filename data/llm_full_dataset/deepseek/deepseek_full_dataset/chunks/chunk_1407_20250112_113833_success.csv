The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was to use the proceeds of the PBC to partially finance a $45,649,610.37 commercial contract with ZTE Corporation, which was signed on August 17, 2009.  The PBC officially entered into force on April 8, 2010.   The purpose of the project was to establish a high-speed fiber optic cable network in Mongolia. The ultimate goals of the project were to increase the scope and quality of mobile communication services, improve the provision of e-government services, expand the provision of distance learning, internet access, and video conferencing, and bridge the urban-rural digital data gap.   ZTE Corporation was the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. However, there were also 17 Mongolian subcontractors involved in implementation (Moncable, New Optics, S&M, Leadernet, Nopsan, Satylate Power, Geotrass, Supercom, Comtech, Quarry Mart, Portal, Skynetworks, Gemnet, Badral, Kharaat Teel, Berjin Unt, and Newtelecom). Fiber optic installation commenced in August 2011. By June 2014, 9000 km of high speed fiber optic cable network and transmission facilities had been established across 150 soums within 21 aimags. As a result, 90 percent of all soums in Mongolia had access to high-speed Internet and other public and private e-services. Of the 150 soums connected to the fiber-optic network, 129 soums were part of an integrated monitoring system and are ready for service, and 21 additional soums were expected to be fully integrated by August 15, 2014. The project was ultimately completed on August 25, 2014.","1. This project is also known as the ICT Network Expansion and Modernization Project.

For the time being, AidData relies upon the latter date because the finalization of a commercial contract typically predates the signature of a China Eximbank loan agreement. However, this issue merits further investigation. 4. The precise face value of the China Eximbank PBC is unknown. However, the borrower was authorized to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance up to 85% of the commercial contract with ZTE Corporation. Therefore, AidData assumes that the face value of the PBC was equivalent to 85% of $45,649,610.37 ($38,802,168). 5.

98593,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","China Investment Corporation provides $500 million debenture to SouthGobi Energy Resources to support its investment program in Mongolia and for working capital, repayment, and general corporate purposes","On October 26, 2009, Fullbloom Investment Corporation — a wholly-owned investment subsidiary of China Investment Corporation (CIC) — signed a $500,000,000 secured convertible debenture (loan) agreement with SouthGobi Energy Resources Limited (a Toronto Stock Exchange-listed coal mining and exploration company with its main producing assets in Mongolia) to support its investment program in Mongolia and for working capital, repayment, and general corporate purposes.  This secured convertible debenture carried an interest rate of 8.0% [6.4% payable in cash and 1.6% in payable in SouthGobi shares, where the number of shares to be issued is calculated based on the 50-day volume-weighted average price (VWAP)] and maximum term of 30 years. The proceeds of the debenture were to be used by the borrower to support its accelerated investment program in Mongolia, with up to $120 million for use for working capital, repayment of debt due on funding, general and administrative expenses, and other general corporate purposes. The convertible interest was common equity of SouthGobi. CIC held a security interest in SouthGobi’s assets, had a pre-emptive right on future SouthGobi share issuances, and was entitled to nominate a director for election or appointment to SouthGobi’s board of directors.  The convertible debenture was secured by (i.e. collateralized against) a first charge over SouthGobi's assets. The debenture required standard loan restrictive covenants regarding incurring additional debt and granting additional security to third parties (with standard carve-outs and grace periods for issues of this type) to SouthGobi and its direct and indirect subsidiaries..   The initial conversion price was set as the lower of $11.88 CAD or the 50-day VWAP at the date of conversion, with a floor price of $8.88 per share CAD. After five years from the issuance date, if at any part of the conversion price was greater $10.66 CAD, SouthGobi would be entitled to require conversion of the outstanding convertible debenture in whole or in part into common shares at the conversion price. SouthGobi and CIC each had various rights to call conversion of the debenture into common shares. CIC had the right to convert the debenture, in whole or in part, into common shares 12 months after the date of issuance (November 2010). SouthGobi had the right to call for the conversion of up to $250.0 million USD of the debenture on the earlier of 24 months after the issuance date, if the conversion price was greater than $10.66 CAD, or upon SouthGobi achieving a public float of 25% of its common shares under certain agreed circumstances, if the conversion price is greater than $10.66 CAD. SouthGobi was entitled to require conversion of one-half of the principal at any time upon completion of a Hong Kong Stock Exchange listing and to require conversion of the entire amount as of and after November 2014. The HKSE listing occurred in January 2010.   On November 19, 2009, SouthGobi issued the convertible debenture to Land Breeze II S.à r.l. (CIC Subco), another wholly-owned subsidiary of CIC.  On November 30, 2009, the borrower repaid a $30 million credit facility from Ivanhoe Minerals using the proceeds from the debenture. Then, on March 29, 2010, CIC, at SouthGobi’s request, converted $250 million of its convertible debenture into common shares of SouthGobi at a conversion price of $11.88 CAD per share. SouthGobi issued 21,560,961 common shares to CIC Subco; as a result, CIC owned approximately 13% of the common shares of SouthGobi Energy.  On June 12, 2017, SouthGobi executed a deferral agreement with CIC with CIC for a revised repayment schedule on the $22.3 million of cash interest and associated costs due on May 19, 2017.

It is wholly owned by the Chinese Government and has its own corporate entity status. The purpose of the CIC is to maximize returns at acceptable risk tolerance and improve the corporate governance of key state-owned financial institutions. It was established in 2007 with about $200 billion of assets under management, a number that grew to $1.2 trillion in 2021.2.  A debenture is a debt instrument used by a lender, such as a bank, when providing capital to companies and individuals. It enables the lender to secure loan repayments against the borrower’s assets – even if they default on the payment. A debenture can grant a fixed charge or a floating charge. A fixed charge is normally taken out against a tangible asset such as property. It enables the lender to take ownership of the borrower’s assets and sell them off in the event of a payment default. With a fixed charge, the borrower would not be able to sell the asset without the lender’s consent. A floating charge – which is usually attached to assets such as shares, raw materials and intellectual property – implies that the assets may change over time, and the borrower can sell them without the lender’s intervention. However, floating charges may become fixed if the borrower defaults.3. A convertible debenture is a type of long-term debt issued by a company that can be converted into shares of equity stock after a specified period.","# Sector

# Title
China Investment Corporation provides $500 million debenture to SouthGobi Energy Resources to support its investment program in Mongolia and for working capital, repayment, and general corporate purposes

# Description
On October 26, 2009, Fullbloom Investment Corporation — a wholly-owned investment subsidiary of China Investment Corporation (CIC) — signed a $500,000,000 secured convertible debenture (loan) agreement with SouthGobi Energy Resources Limited (a Toronto Stock Exchange-listed coal mining and exploration company with its main producing assets in Mongolia) to support its investment program in Mongolia and for working capital, repayment, and general corporate purposes.  This secured convertible debenture carried an interest rate of 8.0% [6.4% payable in cash and 1.6% in payable in SouthGobi shares, where the number of shares to be issued is calculated based on the 50-day volume-weighted average price (VWAP)] and maximum term of 30 years. The proceeds of the debenture were to be used by the borrower to support its accelerated investment program in Mongolia, with up to $120 million for use for working capital, repayment of debt due on funding, general and administrative expenses, and other general corporate purposes. The convertible interest was common equity of SouthGobi. CIC held a security interest in SouthGobi’s assets, had a pre-emptive right on future SouthGobi share issuances, and was entitled to nominate a director for election or appointment to SouthGobi’s board of directors.  The convertible debenture was secured by (i.e. collateralized against) a first charge over SouthGobi's assets. The debenture required standard loan restrictive covenants regarding incurring additional debt and granting additional security to third parties (with standard carve-outs and grace periods for issues of this type) to SouthGobi and its direct and indirect subsidiaries..   The initial conversion price was set as the lower of $11.88 CAD or the 50-day VWAP at the date of conversion, with a floor price of $8.88 per share CAD. After five years from the issuance date, if at any part of the conversion price was greater $10.66 CAD, SouthGobi would be entitled to require conversion of the outstanding convertible debenture in whole or in part into common shares at the conversion price. SouthGobi and CIC each had various rights to call conversion of the debenture into common shares. CIC had the right to convert the debenture, in whole or in part, into common shares 12 months after the date of issuance (November 2010). SouthGobi had the right to call for the conversion of up to $250.0 million USD of the debenture on the earlier of 24 months after the issuance date, if the conversion price was greater than $10.66 CAD, or upon SouthGobi achieving a public float of 25% of its common shares under certain agreed circumstances, if the conversion price is greater than $10.66 CAD. SouthGobi was entitled to require conversion of one-half of the principal at any time upon completion of a Hong Kong Stock Exchange listing and to require conversion of the entire amount as of and after November 2014. The HKSE listing occurred in January 2010.   On November 19, 2009, SouthGobi issued the convertible debenture to Land Breeze II S.à r.l. (CIC Subco), another wholly-owned subsidiary of CIC.  On November 30, 2009, the borrower repaid a $30 million credit facility from Ivanhoe Minerals using the proceeds from the debenture. Then, on March 29, 2010, CIC, at SouthGobi’s request, converted $250 million of its convertible debenture into common shares of SouthGobi at a conversion price of $11.88 CAD per share.
