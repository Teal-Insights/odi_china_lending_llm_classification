64818,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides loan for 115kV Pakse-Khone Pha Pheng Transmission Line Project,"In 2005, China Eximbank signed a loan agreement with the Government of Laos for the 115kV Pakse-Khone Pha Pheng Transmission Line Project. The face value and borrowing terms of the loan are unknown.  The project involved the construction of 3 substations and two 115 kV transmission lines between Ban Jiangxai (Pakse) to Ban Na-Ban Hat (Thakho) measuring 122 kilometers in length. China-East Resources Import & Export Company (CERIECO) was the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction commenced in November 2003 and reached completion in November 2005.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the 115kV Pakse-Khone Pha Pheng Transmission Line Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. Laos’ gross foreign exchange reserves were dangerously low between 2019 and 2021, hovering between 1.4 and 2.3 months of import cover, and total public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt increased from 68 percent of GDP ($12.5 billion) in 2019 to 88 percent in 2021 of GDP (or $14.5 billion). According to a report published by the World Bank in April 2022, ‘[t]he energy sector, mostly represented by Électricité du Laos (EDL), accounted for over 30 percent of total PPG debt in 2021. […] EDL’s debt service obligations [were] still unsustainable [at the time], with future debt service accounting for about two fifths of EDL’s total operating revenue.’ The Laotian authorities sought and secured debt service payment deferrals from their Chinese creditors in 2020 and 2021; according to the World Bank, ‘[d]ebt service deferrals granted by major lenders in 2020-2021 amounted around 3.6 percent of GDP in 2021’ and ’[a]s a result, actual debt service payments are estimated to have declined to 48 percent of total revenues in 2021, compared to 65 percent in the 2021 [Government of Laos] plan.’  The country’s central bank (Bank of the Lao P.D.R) also made a $300 million drawdown under its currency swap agreement with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in June 2020 — when its gross reserves stood at only 1.5 months of import cover and credit rating agencies warned of a high default probability. Then, in 2021, the short-term emergency loan from the PBOC was ‘rolled over’ for another year. Around the same time, a Chinese state-owned enterprise purchased a major public infrastructure asset in Laos—a large part of the country’s electricity transmission grid—from EDL as part of an apparent debt-for-equity swap. China Southern Power Grid Co. and EDL established a joint venture known as Électricité du Laos Transmission Company Limited (EDLT) in September 2020.  China Southern Power Grid Co. purchased a 90% ownership stake in EDLT in exchange for a $600 million fee (equity infusion). Then, in March 2021, EDLT signed a 25-year concession agreement, which made it responsible for management of the country’s high-voltage transmission network above 230 kilovolts. Independent observers suggested at the time that EDL would likely use the $600 million upfront payment from China Southern Power Grid Co. to service its outstanding debts to Chinese creditors, although this has not been independently confirmed. According to the World Bank’s International Debt Statistics, the Government of Laos was responsible for making average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $232 million between 2019 and 2019 and average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $60 million between 2020 and 2021 (a substantially lower figure due to payment deferrals); however, it expected to make average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth nearly $678 million over the next seven years (2022-2028).","1.

65400,TRADE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS,Chinese Government provides RMB 46 million interest-free loan — via 1996 ETCA — for the Container Inspection Equipment Project,"In 1996, the Chinese Government and the Government of Lebanon signed an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) in which the Chinese Government agreed to finance projects in Lebanon. Then, in 2005, the Chinese Government issued an interest-free loan to the Government of Lebanon for the Container Inspection Equipment Project. The loan had a face value of RMB 46 million; its maturity and grace period are unknown.  The purpose of the project was to supply and install two non-intrusive (THSCAN) x-ray container/vehicle inspection scanners in the Port of Beirut. The scanners would enhance Lebanon's anti-smuggling and counter-terrorism efforts, while also allowing customs inspection to be more efficient and rigorous.   Nuctech Company, Ltd. was the contractor responsible for the provision of the scanners. It signed an implementation contract with Lebanon’s Ministry of Finance on April 11, 2006 for the provision of the scanners and the training of Lebanese Customs officials in their use and maintenance. The contract also stipulated that the scanners would be delivered to Lebanon in 6 months.  The outbreak of the 2006 Lebanon War (also known as the 2006 Israel–Hezbollah War, the July War, and the Second Lebanon War) in July and August 2006 delayed the arrival of the scanners for some time.

The second scanner was expected to arrive before the end of 2006. The second scanner was delivered in 2007, but its precise implementation end date is unknown.
