39339,HEALTH,Chinese Government provides RMB 12.5 million grant — via ETCA — for New Navua Hospital Relocation and Construction Project,"On November 23, 2009, the Chinese Government and the Government of Fiji signed an exchange of letters, which committed RMB 12.5 million (FJD 7,800,000) of grant funding for the New Navua Hospital Relocation and Construction Project. The grant agreement was signed by Chinese Ambassador to Fiji Han Zhiqiang and Fiji Prime Minister’s Permanent Secretary Tikduadua. The grant proceeds were drawn from an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) that the two governments signed on on December 22, 2011 (captured in Project ID#73711).   The purpose of the project was to construct a new, 3,000-square-meter hospital with 30 beds in the village of Namelimeli, just outside the town Navua. It involved the construction of an outpatient clinic, emergency clinic, medical technical rooms, in-patient rooms, and administrative and supporting facilities. The old Navua hospital was frequently flooded during heavy rains. A design contract was signed on November 25, 2009, and the design of the new hospital was approved by the Fijian Government, but it was negotiated through the Prime Minister’s Office. Fiji’s Ministry of Health had no involvement at the design stage. Yanjian Group was the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction began on September 28, 2012 and ended on May 30, 2014. The hospital was officially opened on July 31, 2014.   The Navua Hospital Relocation and Construction Project was subject to some degree of local criticism and controversy. When the hospital was initially handed over to the local authorities in Fiji, health officials discovered a number of problematic design features: the toilets were too small, kitchen tiles were too slippery, basins were too shallow to clean medical instruments, and ramps were too steep to transport patients.  However, there is some evidence of post-project implementation follow-up by the sponsor.  On September 6, 2014, MOFCOM conducted a project site inspection. Then, in May 2016, a Chinese Government-funded technical team arrived to conduct repair and maintenance and provide training on medical equipment usage at the hospital.","The Chinese project title is 援斐济纳务瓦医院项目.An unveiling ceremony of the Fiji-China (Guangdong) Medical Training Center and Navua Hospital Emergency Center was held on July 17, 2017.
