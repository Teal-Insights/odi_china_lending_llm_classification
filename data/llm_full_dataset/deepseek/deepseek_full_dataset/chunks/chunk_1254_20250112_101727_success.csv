The borrowing terms of the loan are as follows: a 20 year maturity (final maturity date:  March 21, 2031), a 5 year grace period (first repayment date: September 21, 2016), and a 2% interest rate.   The loan's principal amount outstanding was RMB 341,396,673.36 as of June 2023. As of 2022, the borrower expected to make principal repayments each year worth RMB 35,936,491 until 2031.  The project involved the construction of the Malawi University of Science and Technology (MUST) in the district of Thyolo. The university was designed to accommodate 3,000 students.

The key feature of the Extended DSSI is that the repayment period of the principal and interest payments falling due between 1st January 2021 to 30th June 2021 will be made in five years with one-year grace period. This entails that in 2021/22 FY, the suspended debt service will be within the grace period.’ Then, in November 2022, the World Bank and the IMF judged the Government of Malawi’s external debt and overall public debt to be ‘in distress’—a downgrade from the previous World Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA).
