33380,COMMUNICATIONS,China Eximbank provides $88.66 million buyer’s credit loan for Colombo Lotus Tower Project (Linked to Project ID#96152),"On September 17, 2012, China Eximbank and Sri Lanka’s Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) signed a $88.66 million buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement [No. BLA-201207] for the Colombo Lotus Tower Project. The BCL, which is captured via Project ID#33380, carries the following terms: a 12 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, a 0.7% commitment fee, a 0.9% management fee, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 4% margin. The loan’s final maturity date is July 21, 2024. The total cost of the Colombo Lotus Tower Project was $104.3 million and proceeds of the BCL were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the project cost. The Government of Sri Lanka issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the BCL. The loan’s outstanding amount was $49.53 million as of December 31, 2018, $40.66 million os of December 31, 2019, $31.79 million as of December 31, 2020, and $22.93 million as of December 31, 2021.   The purpose of the project was to establish a multipurpose television and telecommunication tower with a leisure park in Colombo. It involved the construction of a 350 meter high multifunctional telecommunication tower with a floor area that includes radio and TV transmission, restaurants, hotels, conference & exhibition facilities, and a leisure park. Upon completion, the Colombo Lotus Tower or ('Nelum Kuluna') was expected to be South Asia's tallest tower. Lotus Tower's main revenue sources were expected to be tourism and antenna leasing. It was expected to function as a radio and television broadcasting antenna ISDB-T and proposed DVB-T2 support structure for 50 television services, 35 FM radio stations, and and 20 telecommunication service providers. It was also expected to house a variety of tourist attractions.   A Chinese consortium — consisting of China National Electronics Import and Export Corporation (CEIEC) and Aerospace Long-March International Trade Co.Ltd. (ALIT) — initially agreed to jointly implement the project on a turnkey basis. However, ALIT left the consortium in August 2015, entrusting its partner CEIEC to act solely on its behalf to fulfill the contract with the TRC. Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co., Ltd was also involved in implementation.   A foundation stone laying ceremony took place on January 20, 2012. Construction began on November 12, 2012.

The second stage of the tower (which includes e-sports centers and a digital museum) was scheduled for opening in November 2022 and the third stage of the tower (which includes a 9D cinema and a revolving restaurant) was scheduled for opening in March 2023. The Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka claims that the project created jobs for more than 1000 local workers. However, the project was plagued by implementation delays, financial mismanagement allegations, and debt repayment challenges. Sri Lanka's Ports and Aviation Minister Arjuna Ranatunga claimed that construction was taking place on land that belongs to the Ports Authority without proper government approval. Also, President Maithripala Sirisena alleged in 2019 that ALIT misappropriated 2 billion rupees (approximately $11 million) in a deal to work on the construction of South Asia's tallest tower.   Then, in 2020, China Eximbank and TRC signed a debt rescheduling agreement (captured via Project ID#96152) that extended the loan’s maturity date by two years: from July 21, 2024 to July 31, 2026. In July 2022, the Financial Times reported that the tower “was designed to look like a giant lotus bud about to burst into flower, [and] it was intended to be a metaphor for the flourishing of Sri Lanka’s economy and the 'brilliant future' of the bilateral co-operation between Beijing and Colombo. Instead, the tower has become a symbol of the mounting problems facing China’s overseas lending scheme, the ‘Belt and Road Initiative.' The construction suffered from lengthy delays and an allegation of corruption [leveled] by Sri Lanka’s then-president Maithripala Sirisena against one of the Chinese contractors.   Now, three years after its official launch, the tower’s amenities including a shopping mall, a conference center, and several restaurants stand either unfinished or largely unused while outside on the streets outrage over Sri Lanka’s financial mismanagement has boiled over into popular protests. ‘It is something we would have done better without,’ says Athula Kumarasiri, a bookshop owner, as he motions towards the tower. ‘What is the need for this? It is a complete white elephant.'

The GCL is captured via Project ID#39024.  The Government of Sri Lanka on-lent the proceeds of BCL, PBC, and GCL to Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), the state-owned operator of major commercial ports in Sri Lanka. It was originally envisaged that SLPA would use the proceeds of the BCL, PBC, and GCL to finance 100% of the cost of a $808.1 million commercial (EPC) contract that it signed with China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) on December 31, 2010.  The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 4% margin, a 15-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, a 0.7% commitment fee, and a 0.9% management fee.

The PBC disbursed an unknown amount in 2012, an unknown amount in 2013, $147,249,692.27 in 2014, and $21,049,128.50 in 2015. As of December 31, 2019, it had achieved a 100% disbursement rate ($600 million out of $600 million). The PBC’s amount outstanding was $600,000,000 as of December 31, 2016 and $484,615,385 as of June 30, 2022. The BCL was cancelled in 2019 and never disbursed.  Phase II of the Hambantota Port Development Project (HPDP) envisaged the construction of a large industrial area and a shipyard facility and required the acquisition of 1,500 hectares of land. It involved the construction of a quay wall (2140 m long) to accommodate 6 container berths, oil terminal (300 meters long), yard & roads, a flyover bridge, deepening of entrance channel (450 m wide, 840 m long, 18 meter deep), 2 feeder berths, construction of an artificial island (50 Ha) & handling facilities, and excavating a new basin area.  Upon completion, it was envisaged that the port in Hambantota, deeper than the one at Colombo, would be used as a refueling and docking station for the Sri Lankan Navy. CHEC was the general EPC contractor responsible for HPDP Phase II implementation. Phase II was formally launched on November 18, 2010.  However, construction did not begin until September 16, 2012, a day before the three loan agreements were signed. Phase II was originally slated for completion in November 2015. A formal port handover ceremony took place on December 11, 2017. However, as of December 31, 2017, Phase II had still only achieved a 96% physical completion rate.  Phases I and II of the Hambantota Port Development Project (HPDP) encountered financial management problems, debt repayment challenges, and corruption allegations. Hambantota Port generated lower-than-expected container traffic and proved to be commercially nonviable under SLPA ownership. Consequently, SLPA could not service its loans to China Eximbank. In response, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited (CMPort) — a subsidiary of China Merchants Group (a Chinese state-owned enterprise) — purchased a majority ownership stake in the port and the right to operate and develop it for 99 years.  More specifically, on July 29, 2017, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited (CMPort), a subsidiary of China Merchants Group, and Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA) signed a 99-year concession agreement and formed a joint venture to operate Hambantota Port. According to the terms of the joint venture agreement, CMPort acquired an 85% stake in Hambantota International Ports Group (HIPG) and a 49.3% stake in Hambantota International Port Services (HIPS), representing about 70% of the total equity. CMPort was also granted the operating and management rights of HIPG and HIPS as well as the lease and development rights of approximately 11.5 square kilometers of land in the Hambantota port area. CMPort agreed to make a total equity investment of $1.12 billion, of which $974 million would be used to acquire the 85% stake in HIPG and $146 million would be deposited into a bank account in the name of CMPort in Sri Lanka (for the expansion of Hambantota Port and shipping-related business).  According to a July 20, 2017 Cabinet Memorandum entitled ‘Hambantota Port Concession Agreement’ (No. MPS/SEC/2017/32) that was approved by Sri Lanka’s Cabinet on August 4, 2017, when the concession agreement was signed, responsibility for repayment of the China Eximbank loans that were contracted for the construction of Hambantota Port was transferred from SLPA to the General Treasury. Given that the General Treasury was also identified as the recipient of the $974 million cash infusion from CMPort, many media outlets and commentators reported that the arrangement represented a ‘debt-for-equity’ swap.  However, the Government of Sri Lanka continued to have difficulty servicing its debts to China Eximbank for Phases I and II of the HPDP after 2017. On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a ‘pre-emptive’ sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. This decision to suspend external debt service affected all of the China Eximbank loans that were issued for Phases I and II of the HPDP.  Another source of controversy arose in June 2018 when the New York Times reported that $7.6 million had been transferred from a Standard Chartered Bank account controlled by China Harbor Engineering Co. (labelled ‘HPDP Phase 2’) to affiliates of President Rajapaksa’s re-election campaign. The New York Times also reported that checks worth $1.2 million (linked to the ‘HPDP Phase 2’ bank account) were delivered to President Rajapaksa’s official residence.","1.

The PBC disbursed an unknown amount in 2012, an unknown amount in 2013, $147,249,692.27 in 2014, and $21,049,128.50 in 2015. As of December 31, 2019, it had achieved a 100% disbursement rate ($600 million out of $600 million). The PBC’s amount outstanding was $600,000,000 as of December 31, 2016 and $484,615,385 as of June 30, 2022. The BCL was cancelled in 2019 and never disbursed.  Phase II of the Hambantota Port Development Project (HPDP) envisaged the construction of a large industrial area and a shipyard facility and required the acquisition of 1,500 hectares of land. It involved the construction of a quay wall (2140 m long) to accommodate 6 container berths, oil terminal (300 meters long), yard & roads, a flyover bridge, deepening of entrance channel (450 m wide, 840 m long, 18 meter deep), 2 feeder berths, construction of an artificial island (50 Ha) & handling facilities, and excavating a new basin area.  Upon completion, it was envisaged that the port in Hambantota, deeper than the one at Colombo, would be used as a refueling and docking station for the Sri Lankan Navy. CHEC was the general EPC contractor responsible for HPDP Phase II implementation. Phase II was formally launched on November 18, 2010.  However, construction did not begin until September 16, 2012, a day before the three loan agreements were signed. Phase II was originally slated for completion in November 2015. A formal port handover ceremony took place on December 11, 2017. However, as of December 31, 2017, Phase II had still only achieved a 96% physical completion rate.  Phases I and II of the Hambantota Port Development Project (HPDP) encountered financial management problems, debt repayment challenges, and corruption allegations. Hambantota Port generated lower-than-expected container traffic and proved to be commercially nonviable under SLPA ownership. Consequently, SLPA could not service its loans to China Eximbank. In response, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited (CMPort) — a subsidiary of China Merchants Group (a Chinese state-owned enterprise) — purchased a majority ownership stake in the port and the right to operate and develop it for 99 years.  More specifically, on July 29, 2017, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited (CMPort), a subsidiary of China Merchants Group, and Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA) signed a 99-year concession agreement and formed a joint venture to operate Hambantota Port. According to the terms of the joint venture agreement, CMPort acquired an 85% stake in Hambantota International Ports Group (HIPG) and a 49.3% stake in Hambantota International Port Services (HIPS), representing about 70% of the total equity. CMPort was also granted the operating and management rights of HIPG and HIPS as well as the lease and development rights of approximately 11.5 square kilometers of land in the Hambantota port area. CMPort agreed to make a total equity investment of $1.12 billion, of which $974 million would be used to acquire the 85% stake in HIPG and $146 million would be deposited into a bank account in the name of CMPort in Sri Lanka (for the expansion of Hambantota Port and shipping-related business).  According to a July 20, 2017 Cabinet Memorandum entitled ‘Hambantota Port Concession Agreement’ (No. MPS/SEC/2017/32) that was approved by Sri Lanka’s Cabinet on August 4, 2017, when the concession agreement was signed, responsibility for repayment of the China Eximbank loans that were contracted for the construction of Hambantota Port was transferred from SLPA to the General Treasury. Given that the General Treasury was also identified as the recipient of the $974 million cash infusion from CMPort, many media outlets and commentators reported that the arrangement represented a ‘debt-for-equity’ swap.  However, the Government of Sri Lanka continued to have difficulty servicing its debts to China Eximbank for Phases I and II of the HPDP after 2017. On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a ‘pre-emptive’ sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. This decision to suspend external debt service affected all of the China Eximbank loans that were issued for Phases I and II of the HPDP.  Another source of controversy arose in June 2018 when the New York Times reported that $7.6 million had been transferred from a Standard Chartered Bank account controlled by China Harbor Engineering Co.

To achieve these goals, a 61m high and 465m long dam was constructed and reservoir was impounded. Upon completion, it was expected that the Moragahakanda reservoir would hold 570 million cubic metres (MCM) of water covering an extent of 2,950 hectares. The intended beneficiaries of this project are people living in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Mathale, and Trincomalee districts.   Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on January 25, 2012. A groundbreaking ceremony took place in February 2013. On May 31, 2017 the four units of the Moragahakanda Dam completed debugging ahead of grid connection.
