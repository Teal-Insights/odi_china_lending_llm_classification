67803,"AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY, FISHING",China Eximbank provides $1.5 billion buyer’s credit loan for the purchase of grain and the export of grain to China (Linked to Project ID#42559 and ID#85202),"On June 28, 2012, China Eximbank and the Government of Ukraine’s Ministry of Agriculture and Food signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) regarding a $3 billion line of credit (captured in Project ID#42559). This agreement, which is popularly known as the loan-for-corn deal (or loan-for-grain deal), specified that China Eximbank would provide a $3 billion line of credit to PJSC 'State Food Grain Corporation of Ukraine' (SFGCU or PJSC DPZKU) — a Ukrainian state-owned enterprise — in two loan tranches: the first $1.5 billion tranche would be for the purchase of grain (through forward and spot contracts) and the export of grain to China, and the second $1.5 billion tranche would be for the acquisition of Chinese goods (plant protection products, machinery, elevator equipment) and potentially also the construction of biodiesel and corn processing production plants.   Then, on October 24, 2012, SFGCU and China National Complete Engineering Corporation (CCEC) signed a 'General Contract for Cooperation.' The contract specified that the $3 billion China Eximbank loan was to be repaid within 15 years with the proceeds from grain supply contracts between SFGCU and CCEC. Grain supply was to begin in 2012 (or 2013) and continue until 2027 (or 2028). The supply/sale of maize and other grains from SFGCU to CCEC was not to be less than 80 million metric ton over the 15-year period. SFGCU agreed to supply/sell 4 million tons in the first year, 4.5 million tons in the second year, and 5.2 million tons in the third year. Grain prices were tethered to futures contracts for the relevant period of time on the Dalian Commodity Exchange of China. The contract also stipulated that, in the event that SFGCU did not meet its annual grain supply commitments, CCEC had the right to notify China Eximbank so that it could in turn adjust loan disbursements in proportion to the annual supply of grain. SFGCU also granted CCEC the right to re-export grain to other countries for their legal resale. Additionally, under the terms of the contract, SFGCU agreed to buy various goods (including fuel, mineral fertilizers, plant protection products, seeds, agricultural machinery) and services from CCEC.  The contract further stipulated that CCEC would be the main EPC contractor for any turnkey project financed by the $3 billion loan agreement. The contract identified $1.5 billion worth of goods, services, and turnkey projects that CCEC would supply to SFGCU between 2013 and 2017: $275 million for the purchase of Chinese plant protection products; $305 million for the purchase of mineral fertilizers; $55 million for the purchase of agricultural machinery; $350 million for the purchase of seeds; $70 million for the construction of a plant for organic and mineral fertilizers; $70 million for the construction of a plant for the production of plant protection products; $195 million for the construction of an agricultural market center; $15 million for agricultural waste as alternative energy sources (pellets); and $165 million for the construction of a port elevator.  Then, on December 26, 2012, China Eximbank and SFGCU signed a $1.5 billion buyer’s credit loan agreement [№ BLA 201209], which represented the first tranche described in the June 28, 2012 MOU. This loan agreement is captured in Project ID#67803. It carried the following terms: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.515% in December 2012) plus a 4.5% margin, a maturity of 15 years, and a 5 year grace period. The final maturity date of the loan was December 28, 2027. The Government of Ukraine issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. In the event that SFGCU did not meet its repayment obligations, the guarantor (the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Ukraine) agreed to pay the amount of debt that was outstanding within 20 working days of receiving a written request from China Eximbank.   The full amount of the first tranche ($1.5 billion) was reportedly disbursed by China Eximbank and deposited in an account controlled by Ukraine Export-Import Bank (Ukreximbank) on February 6, 2013. The proceeds of the loan were reportedly used by the borrower (SFGCU) for forward grain purchases (i.e the purchase of barley, wheat, and corn from Ukrainian farmers intended for export to China). However, the SFGCU did not honor its commitment to sell 4-6 million tons of grain to CCEC each year. The SFGCU’s First Deputy Board Chairman Robert Brovdi said that his company had only exported 1.5 million tons of grain to China as of December 3, 2013. Other sources suggest that grain deliveries ranged between 10% and 23% of the agreed volumes. In March 2013, CCEC filed a complaint against SFGCU at the London Court of International Arbitration for failing to fulfill its grain supply obligations (and thus effectively defaulting on its repayment obligations under its $1.5 billion buyer’s credit loan with China Eximbank). Shortly thereafter, the Ukrainian media reported that the loan had been defrauded, and Ukrainian officials had demanded large bribes in return for declaring to purchase agricultural machines in China.   On March 11, 2014, the Ukrainian Ministry of Agricultural Policy and Food relieved Ihor Yakubovych, the Chairman of the SFGCU, of his duties. Then, in April 2014, CCEC and SFGCU performed a comprehensive audit of SFGCU’s implementation of projects associated with the $1.5 billion dollar loan. Then, in early September 2014, the Prosecutor General's Office informed Ihor Yakubovych that he and his deputy were suspected of a crime: misuse of credit funds (from China Eximbank) and deliberately creating the conditions for embezzlement of $15 million in cooperation with other persons. Several months later, in January 2015, the Prosecutor General's Office put Ihor Yakubovych and his deputy on a ‘wanted list’ for allegedly fabricating official documents and embezzling funds. According to an investigation undertaken by the Prosecutor General's Office, Ihor Yakubovych and the SFGCU Director of the Department of Trading and Sales purchased grain for loans obtained under state guarantees through fictitious enterprises and sold the grain below market price to such companies as SN, Trans Trade RK SA, RL Prosperis Commerce SA, Trans Trade RK SA, Apiq Commodities Gmbh, Ai Amal General Traiding Limited, QAM7, and GSteam. In 2015, China Eximbank and SFGCU amended the $1.5 billion buyer’s credit loan agreement in an unusual way. The amended agreement specified (in Annex 3) that, for every ton of grain exported by SFGCU to China, SFGCU would be obliged to pay China Eximbank a $5 ‘commission’ (above and beyond its principal and interest repayment obligations). Additional problems arose in 2017. On March 20, 2017, SFGCU was accused of attempting to illegally appropriate a privately-owned grain port terminal to increase its export capacity to China. Several media outlets also reported in 2017 that Ukreximbank froze SFGCU’s bank accounts at the request of China Eximbank.   Due to anticipated loan repayment difficulties, SFGCU and China Eximbank also engaged in debt rescheduling negotiations in March 2017. The parties ultimately agreed to reduce the loan’s interest rate from 6-month LIBOR + a 4.5% margin to 6-month LIBOR + a 3% margin. This loan rescheduling is captured via Project ID#85202.  Semi-annual principal repayments  commenced in January 2018 and the loan's principal amount outstanding stood at $1.2 billion in October 2019 and $900 million in October 2021.   Additional problems and controversies arose in 2019 and 2020. At the end of 2019, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) reported the detention of another former SFGCU chairman in Lithuania. Then, in early 2020, the Acting Chairman of the Board of SFGCU, Simon Chernyavsky, announced that law enforcement had opened 150 criminal cases against SFGCU officials. He also announced on March 2, 2020 that SFGCU was ordered by the London Court of International Arbitration to pay $4 million to CCEC. In August 2021, Ihor Yakubovych made an unsuccessful attempt to flee the country, but was detained by the National Police. In July 2022, China Eximbank was reportedly ‘playing hardball and threatening to send a default note on the loan’. This disclosure came at a time when the Government of Ukraine was seeking a 2-year moratorium on debt repayments to private and official creditors.  On January 23, 2020, SFGCU paid off $115.9 million on the loan issued by the Export-Import Bank of China: the corporation repaid $75 million of principal and $40.9 million of interest.","1. In March 2017, a Vice President of China Eximbank visited SFGCU and announced that its loan with SFGCU would be used for two new projects: the creation of rolling stock (through the acquisition of 3,000 railroad cars from China) and the supply of plant protection products from the People’s Republic of China to Ukraine. SFGCU and China Eximbank also agreed in March 2017 that the Mykolaiv Port Elevator Reconstruction Project would be implemented with proceeds from the loan after the successful launch of the first two projects. These announcements suggested that the second tranche of the loan would be released. However, AidData has not identified any evidence that the second $1.5 billion tranche was ever drawn down or even made available to SFGCU. Ukraine’s Ministry of Finance reports disbursements through the $1.5 billion buyer’s credit loan agreement [№ BLA 201209] that was issued on December 26, 2012, but it does not report any disbursements through (drawdowns under) the second, $1.5 billion loan tranche. 2. The Overseas Development Finance Dataset published by Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center in December 2020 identifies the face value of the 2012 loan from China Eximbank loan as $3 billion. AidData records the face value that is reported by Ukraine’s Ministry of Finance ($1.5 billion). 3. Between January 2021 and May 2021, SFGCU concluded 10 foreign trade contracts for the export of grain with these foreign companies for more than $231 million. By the end of July 2021, the receivables of SN, Trans Trade RK SA, RL Prosperis Commerce SA, Trans Trade RK SA, Apiq Commodities Gmbh, Ai Amal General Traiding Limited, QAM7, and GSteam to SFGCU amounted to more than $57 million.","# Sector
