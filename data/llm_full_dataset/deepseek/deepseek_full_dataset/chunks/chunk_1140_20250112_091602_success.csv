The loan carried a 14 year maturity and a 4 year grace period. Its interest rate is unknown. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina did not issue a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. However, EFT (Holdings) ApS and EFT International Investment Holdings Limited both issued repayment guarantees. The borrower also purchased a buyer’s credit insurance policy from Sinosure.   As an additional credit enhancement, all of the assets and future profits of EFT Rudnik i Termoelektrana Stanari d.o.o. were pledged as sources of collateral to CDB in the event that the borrower could not repay the loan (and the Concessions Commission of the Government of the Republic of Srpska had to make an adjustment to its own rules to ensure that CDB could dispose of the 2008 concession agreement in the event that EFT Rudnik i Termoelektrana Stanari d.o.o. was not able to meet its repayment obligations under the loan agreement).
