30241,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides $293.25 million preferential buyer's credit for 153MW Adama Wind Farm II Project (Linked to Project ID#1380),"On March 27, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development signed a $293,250,000 (ETB 5,420,517,560) preferential buyer credit (PBC) agreement for the 153MW Adama Wind Farm II Project. Then, on June 11, 2013, the Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified the PBC agreement under proclamation no. 795/2013. The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 20 year maturity, an 8 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The Government of Ethiopia's Ministry of Finance and Economic Development subsequently signed an on-lending agreement with Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCO). The ultimate borrower (EEPCO) was expected to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance approximately 85% of the total cost of a $340 million commercial (EPC) contract between EEPCO and Hydrochina-CGCOC JV, which was signed on October 11, 2012.   According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $293,250,000 (ETB 5,420,517,560) loan (PBC) achieved a 123% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 10 loan disbursements (worth ETB 6,659,539,738) between 2013 and 2016: an ETB 1,306,818,182 disbursement on October 8, 2013, an ETB 517,241,379 disbursement on January 8, 2014, an ETB 1,712,598,425 disbursement on July 8, 2014, an ETB 343,434,343 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 142,992,012 disbursement on April 8, 2015, an ETB 184,297,042 disbursement on July 8, 2015, an ETB 445,179,744 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 741,377,956 disbursement on July 7, 2016, an ETB 524,222,698 disbursement on January 7, 2016, and an ETB 741,377,956 disbursement on October 7, 2016. The purpose of the project was to install a 153MW wind farm with 102 turbines near the city of Adama in a range of rocky hills in the Ethiopian highlands 100 kilometers southeast of the capital Addis Ababa. The project also involved the construction of 10 km worth of electricity transmission lines to connect the wind farm to the 230kv grid via the Koka substation.   Hydrochina-CGCOC JV — a joint venture between Hydrochina Corporation, and CGC Overseas Construction Co. Ltd. (CGCOC) — was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Upon completion, it was expected that the Adama II Wind Farm would be able to generate about 476 million kWh electricity every year, thereby meeting over 20% of the electricity needs of the capital city of Ethiopia.  It was also expected that by substituting oil power plants of the same scale, the Adama I Wind Farm and Adama II Wind Farm could together save 160,000 tons of fuel oil and reduce almost 600,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Hydrochina Corporation was responsible for the project’s feasibility study. CGCOC was responsible for the project’s mechanical work. Sany Heavy Industry Co., Ltd. — another Chinese company — was responsible for the provision of the wind turbines. Construction started in June 2013. During the construction phase, in order to avoid dust and sand, water was sprayed on the excavated earth.  In order to minimize the impact of traffic noise and dust brought by vehicle transportation during construction, Hydrochina-CGCOC JV strictly controlled and managed the driving times and routes. Speed bumps were set up on a windy road to reduce dust blown by fast-driving vehicles. Trees, flowers and plants were grown around the booster stations. Hydrochina-CGCOC JV also built stone drainage and afforested slopes near the assembly site of wind turbines, thereby preventing soil erosion. Local floral and fauna species were reportedly protected. An official inauguration ceremony for the Adama Wind Farm II (Adama II Wind Farm) took place on May 18, 2015. The wind farm was then transferred to the project owner (EEPCO) and put into operation in June 2016. The 153MW Adama Wind Farm II Project reportedly created thousands of jobs for local people during the construction phase and continued to provide hundreds of jobs for local people during the operation phase.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Adama Wind Farm II Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs.

According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $349 million PBC achieved a 60% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 16 loan disbursements (worth ETB 4,847,852,378) between 2011 and 2017: an ETB 651,221,131 disbursement on January 8, 2011, an ETB 682,158,333 disbursement on July 7, 2011, an ETB 236,792,990 disbursement on October 10, 2011, an ETB 273,157,439 disbursement on January 8, 2012, an ETB 450,455,536 disbursement on July 7, 2012, an ETB 216,893,784 disbursement on January 8, 2013, an ETB 853,439,518 disbursement on April 8, 2013, an ETB 996,656,460 disbursement on July 7, 2013, an ETB 236,742,424 disbursement on October 8, 2013, an ETB 130,076,628 disbursement on January 8, 2014, an ETB 984,252 disbursement on July 8, 2014, an ETB 808,081 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 491,459 disbursement on July 7, 2015, an ETB 282,589 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 33,385,378 disbursement on October 7, 2016, and an ETB 84,306,376 disbursement on July 7, 2017.   The purpose of the first phase of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project was to construct a new eight-lane asphalt expressway stretching 78 km from Addis Ababa to Adama. The alignment starts from Tulu Dimtu. The main road of the expressway continues 2.8 km along the proposed Addis Adaba outer ring road and then crosses Dukem, Bishoftu and Modjo on their east side. It then passes the old Addis Adama road at 62km and bypasses around Adama on the south side. The expressway ends on the east side of Adama and connects to Adama Awash road. The expressway has 18 km of link road and 7.2 km of frontage road on either side in Adama. The road work involved the construction of six interchanges, three intersections, 77 slab culverts, 36 underpasses and 43 overpasses. The 5.4m-high overpasses are supported by 73t girders, reinforced concrete piers and stone structures. Pedestrians, agricultural vehicles and cars can use three of the underpasses. The underpass for agricultural vehicles has a width of 4.5m and a height of 3.2m. The pedestrian underpass is 4.5m wide and 2.2m high. Car underpasses are larger in size with 6.5m width and 4.5m height. Flood discharge was used to size the culverts, which was designed according to velocity, water scouring and water levels. The project also included the construction of two main toll gates and 13 ramp toll gates.   The ultimate objective of the project was to reduce the travel time on Ethiopia's main import-export route from three hours to one hour. The project also sought to lay the groundwork for the use of innovative technology via tolls and creates local employment opportunities. Upon completion, the project was expected to contribute to the development of roadways between the capital city and other regions, such as Hawassa and Bale.  The Addis-Adama Expressway (AAE) is fully access-controlled and managed by Ethiopian Toll Road Enterprise (ETRE). CCCC was the EPC contractor responsible for the implementation of the project’s first phase and second phase. Phase 1 construction began on April 21, 2010.  According to Samson Wondimu, the Communication Director of ERA, the project’s first phase had achieved a 33.6% completion rate as of April 2012. By September 2012, it had achieved a 50% completion rate. A completion ceremony for the first phase of the project was held on May 5, 2014. The second phase of the project (also known as the Lebu-Akaki-Information Technology Park Outer Ring Road Project, the Lebu-Akaki IT Park Outer Ring Road Project, and the Akaki-Goro and Akaki-Lebu Road Project) involved the construction of a 28.1 km toll road — with three lanes each 3.5 meters wide — that links Adama Town in Oromia State with Addis Ababa. Phase 2 supported two road sections: a 14.6 km Akaki-ICT Park (Goro) road section and a 13.6 km Akaki-Lebu road section. Phase 2 also involved the construction of six bridges, one railway line interchange, and three interchanges at Tulu Dimitu, Akaki and Lebu. Upon completion, the project’s second phase was expected to ease traffic congestion along the Akaki-Bishoftu corridor. Phase 2 began implementation on May 5, 2014 and was originally scheduled to reach completion within 25 months (June 5, 2016). By November 27, 2014, the second phase of the project had achieved a 27% completion rate. By June 2015, the second phase of the project had achieved a 50% completion rate. Phase 2 was ultimately completed on August 6, 2016.   After the completion of first and second phases of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project, traffic volumes on the expressway reportedly exceeded 20,000 vehicles per day on the two-lane road trunk road between Addis Ababa and Adama. In October 2019, an official from the Ethiopian Toll Roads Enterprise (ETRE) reported that around 33 million cars had used the toll expressway over the previous five years, generating around $34 million of revenue for the country. However, according to an October 2021 report, '[a]fter 5 years [the expressway] has earned back only about $30 million in toll revenue, well short of expectations. Ethiopia built the toll road parallel to an existing free highway, and a lot of the traffic has remained on the old road.'  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension).

The shared purpose of these two projects — the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport Expansion Project and the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport Terminal 1, VIP Terminal, Associated Works Design and Build Project — was to increase the annual passenger handling capacity of Addis Ababa Bole International Airport from the 7 million to 22 million. These two projects involved the expansion of an existing terminal (Terminal 1) with a floor area of 30,000 square meters for domestic and regional trips, the construction of a new terminal (Terminal 2) with a floor area of 74,000 square meters for international trips, and the construction of a VIP terminal. Upon completion, Terminal 2 was expected to have three floors—arrival, departure and ground floors — and include boarding areas, lounges, recreation centers, shopping malls, offices, parking, and other facilities. The VIP terminal — designed for use by leaders, senior government officials, diplomats and other dignitaries — was expected to includes various saloons, lounges, conference rooms, recreation centers, duty-free shops, an IT center and an exclusive parking lot.   Addis Ababa Bole International Airport is located in the Bole area of the city of Addis Ababa, 6 km (3.7 mi) southeast of the city center and 65 km (40 mi) north of Debre Zeyit. Its coordinates are 08°58′40″N 38°47′58″E.  CCCC was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by EAE. The French construction firm ADP Ingénierie supervised construction activities, while the design of the project was managed by CPG Corporation Pte. Ltd., a Singaporean company. Shanxi Construction investment Group Co. Ltd was also involved in the project (most likely as a subcontractor).   The purpose of the $225 million EPC contract between CCCC and EAE was to construct Terminal 2 (‘Phase 1’). The purpose of the $138 million EPC contract between CCCC and EAE was to construct the VIP terminal and expand Terminal 1 (‘Phase 2’).  Phase 1 construction activities began in June 2014. By December 11, 2016, Phase 1 had achieved a 40% completion rate. Phase 1 was originally expected to reach completion by January 2018 (in time for the 30th Ordinary Summit of the African Union). However, it was ultimately completed and officially inaugurated on January 27, 2019. The inauguration ceremony was attended by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. Phase 2 implementation activities commenced in September 2017 and were still underway four years later. On March 30, 2021, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed visited the new VIP terminal being built at the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport. Phase 2 was originally scheduled for completion on May 15, 2021. However, as of April 2022, AidData had not yet found any evidence of project completion.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport Expansion Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023.","1. Addis Ababa Bole International Airport is sometimes simply referred to as Bole International Airport (in Addis Ababa).

Then, on April 3, 2014, the Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified the GCL agreement under Proclamation No. 833/2014, and the agreement entered into force on May 14, 2014. The loan (captured via Project ID#30915) carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, and a 0.25% commitment fee. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the GCL to finance a $225 million commercial (EPC) contract between Ethiopian Airports Enterprise (EAE) — the state-owned entity tasked with administering Ethiopia's airports — and China Communications Construction Company Ltd (CCCC), which was signed in 2012.   Then, on December 27, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed a $117,300,000 (ETB 2,623,784,348) preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport Terminal 1, VIP Terminal, Associated Works Design and Build Project. The Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified the PBC (loan) agreement, which is captured via Project ID#58583, on February 7, 2017. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds from the PBC to finance 85% of the cost of a $138 million commercial contract between Ethiopian Airports Enterprise (EAE) — the state-owned entity tasked with administering Ethiopia's airports — and China Communications Construction Company Ltd (CCCC).   According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the RMB 1.45 billion (ETB 4,302,103,250) loan achieved a 94% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 13 loan disbursements (worth ETB 4,026,390,597) between 2014 and 2021: an ETB 1,337,936,270 disbursement on June 30, 2014, an ETB 492,880,459 disbursement on September 29, 2015, an ETB 92,355,395 disbursement on December 25, 2015, an ETB 112,708,268 disbursement on June 30, 2016, an ETB 87,995,364 disbursement on October 28, 2016, an ETB 72,608,708 disbursement on November 10, 2016, an ETB 104,044,632 disbursement on December 28, 2016, an ETB 194,937,102 disbursement on May 22, 2017, an ETB 192,560,193 disbursement on June 16, 2017, an ETB 59,554,658 disbursement on September 1, 2017, an ETB 197,578,705 disbursement on March 30, 2018, an ETB 469,626,880 disbursement on March 19, 2020, and an ETB 611,603,963 disbursement on January 11, 2021.

The shared purpose of these two projects — the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport Expansion Project and the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport Terminal 1, VIP Terminal, Associated Works Design and Build Project — was to increase the annual passenger handling capacity of Addis Ababa Bole International Airport from the 7 million to 22 million. These two projects involved the expansion of an existing terminal (Terminal 1) with a floor area of 30,000 square meters for domestic and regional trips, the construction of a new terminal (Terminal 2) with a floor area of 74,000 square meters for international trips, and the construction of a VIP terminal. Upon completion, Terminal 2 was expected to have three floors—arrival, departure and ground floors — and include boarding areas, lounges, recreation centers, shopping malls, offices, parking, and other facilities.
