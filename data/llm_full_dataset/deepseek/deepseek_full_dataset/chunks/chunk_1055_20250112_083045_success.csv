57392,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides $139.3 million preferential buyer’s credit for 86MW Lusiwasi Lower Hydropower Expansion Project (Linked to Project ID#30467),"On July 31, 2009, China National Electrical Engineering Company (CNEEC) and the Government of Zambia signed a Letter of Intent, which outlined the possibility that CNEEC would work with ZESCO Limited to develop the 86MW Lusiwasi Lower Hydropower Expansion Project (captured via Project ID#57392) and the 15MW Lunzua Hydropower Rehabilitation Project (captured via Project ID#30467). In exchange for hiring CNEEC, the Government of Zambia requested that China Eximbank extend a preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) for both projects and that CNEEC arrange the financing. In 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Zambia signed a $183.23 million PBC agreement for the 86MW Lusiwasi Lower Hydropower Expansion Project and the 15MW Lunzua Hydropower Rehabilitation Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. According to a 2014 report from Zambia’s Office of the Auditor General (source ID#67159), the proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance (a) 85% ($139,353,132) of the cost of a commercial contract ($163,944,861.43) between ZESCO Limited and CNEEC for the 86MW Lusiwasi Lower Hydropower Expansion Project, which was signed on July 21, 2011; and (b)  85% ($44.2 million) of the cost of a commercial contract ($52 million) between ZESCO Limited and CNEEC for the 14.8MW Lunzua Hydropower Rehabilitation Project, which was signed on July 21, 2011. The remaining 15% was to be provided by the Government of Zambia in counterpart financing.   The 86MW Lusiwasi Lower Hydropower Expansion Project involves the upgrading of the Lusiwasi Hydroelectric Power Plant, which is located in Serenje District and Central Province (exact locational coordinates: -13.34642,31.01898), from from 12MW to 86MW. The project was originally scheduled to reach completion on September 7, 2014.  However, it has faced major implementation delays and become a source of local controversy. One source of concern that emerged was overpricing and the fact that the CNEEC was selected as the contractor through a sole-source contract rather than through a competitive bidding process. Additionally, a Government of Zambia inquiry into CNEEC’s background revealed that the company did not perform to the required standards of good workmanship and quality delivery on previous contracts. ZESCO Limited eventually notified CNEEC of its intentions to terminate their commercial contract. Then, in October 2011, Government of Zambia made the decision to terminate the commercial contract with CNEEC. However, CNEEC was not willing to refund an advance payment of $32,334,632.75 that ZESCO Limited provided between December 21, 2010 and August 23, 2011. Upon consultation between the Government of Zambia and ZESCO Limited, it was decided that the commercial contract would be reinstated in order to avoid the additional costs that would arise from termination. More specifically, a ""no-objection"" was granted as per China Eximbank's request. Upon reinstating CNEEC in June 2012, ZESCO Limited agreed with CNEEC that the implementation would start with the 14.8MW Lunzua Hydropower Rehabilitation Project, and upon completion of that project, the contractor would proceed to implement the 86MW Lusiwasi Lower Hydropower Expansion Project. As of 2017, the 86MW Lusiwasi Lower Hydropower Expansion Project had only achieved a 48% completion rate (against a target rate of 90%).

Then, on June 15, 2014, Chinese Vice President Li Yuanchao and Zambian Vice President Guy Scott witnessed the signing of two Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreements (ETCA). One committed a $32 million grant (captured via Project ID#40890) and the other committed $32 million interest-free loan (captured via Project ID#40889).

As of July 2022, the PBC had achieved a 74.7% disbursement rate ($228,810,000 out of $306,000,000) This project involves the expansion of Kenneth Kaunda International Airport in Lusaka (exact locational coordinates: -15.325266732091906, 28.448490127571315). More specifically, the project involves the construction of a new presidential pavilion, passenger terminal, commercial complex, airport shopping mall, office park, warehousing facilities, fire station, control tower, and hotel. It also included the rehabilitation of the existing terminal into a new one to carter for domestic flights. China Jiangxi Corporation for International Economic and Technical Cooperation is the contractor responsible for design and works. The contract with Zambia Airports Corporation Ltd. (ZACL) came into force on March 10, 2015 and construction began on April 1, 2015. The project was originally expected to commenced on April 21, 2015 and conclude on October 20, 2019. The expected project completion date was later revised to June 2020 and then March 10, 2022. As of July 31, 2020, the project had achieved an 89% completion rate. As of April 30, 2021, the project had achieved a 93% completion rate. As of June 30, 2021, $271,900,000 had been paid to CJIC (representing 75.53% of the EPC contract value). As of August 31, 2021, the new airport terminal building had been handed over and commissioned, but the following works were outstanding: bullet-proofing and finishing on the presidential pavilion (89% completion rate); steel structure installation on the corridor connecting the terminals (35% completion rate); widening of the taxiway shoulder (98% completion rate); rehabilitation of the existing terminal building (5% completion rate); and rehabilitation of ZASTI (10% completion rate).   A formal airport opening ceremony took place on August 9, 2021. This project has been plagued by corruption allegations and performance problems. In April 2015, media outlets reported that Zambian government officials and CJIC stole $25 million from the China Eximbank loan by unilaterally changing the original contract from $385 million to $360 million. This corruption allegation and contract renegotiations delayed project implementation by a few years. Then, in October 2019, China Eximbank reportedly halted loan disbursements due to concerns that the Government of Zambia would default on its repayment obligations. Then, on July 29, 2022, the Ministry of Finance & National Planning (MOFNP) of Zambia announced that it was seeking lender approval to formally cancel the PBC’s undisbursed balance ($77,190,000.00); however, it also noted that it had not yet secured formal lender approval for this action. This announcement came approximately 21 months after the Government of Zambia defaulted on its repayment obligations to Eurobond holders and approximately 6 weeks after China, France, and 14 other countries formed a creditor committee to discuss the Zambian authorities’ request for a debt treatment under ‘the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the DSSI’ endorsed by the G20 and the Paris Club. MOFNP also announced on July 29, 2022 that it planned to finance the completion of the Kenneth Kaunda International Airport (KKIA) Airport Expansion Project with general government revenues, and it signaled its intention to rescope the project to focus on the construction of the old terminal building and the extension of the runway and lighting system.","1.

As of July 2022, the PBC had achieved a 74.7% disbursement rate ($228,810,000 out of $306,000,000) This project involves the expansion of Kenneth Kaunda International Airport in Lusaka (exact locational coordinates: -15.325266732091906, 28.448490127571315). More specifically, the project involves the construction of a new presidential pavilion, passenger terminal, commercial complex, airport shopping mall, office park, warehousing facilities, fire station, control tower, and hotel. It also included the rehabilitation of the existing terminal into a new one to carter for domestic flights. China Jiangxi Corporation for International Economic and Technical Cooperation is the contractor responsible for design and works. The contract with Zambia Airports Corporation Ltd. (ZACL) came into force on March 10, 2015 and construction began on April 1, 2015. The project was originally expected to commenced on April 21, 2015 and conclude on October 20, 2019. The expected project completion date was later revised to June 2020 and then March 10, 2022. As of July 31, 2020, the project had achieved an 89% completion rate. As of April 30, 2021, the project had achieved a 93% completion rate. As of June 30, 2021, $271,900,000 had been paid to CJIC (representing 75.53% of the EPC contract value). As of August 31, 2021, the new airport terminal building had been handed over and commissioned, but the following works were outstanding: bullet-proofing and finishing on the presidential pavilion (89% completion rate); steel structure installation on the corridor connecting the terminals (35% completion rate); widening of the taxiway shoulder (98% completion rate); rehabilitation of the existing terminal building (5% completion rate); and rehabilitation of ZASTI (10% completion rate).   A formal airport opening ceremony took place on August 9, 2021. This project has been plagued by corruption allegations and performance problems. In April 2015, media outlets reported that Zambian government officials and CJIC stole $25 million from the China Eximbank loan by unilaterally changing the original contract from $385 million to $360 million. This corruption allegation and contract renegotiations delayed project implementation by a few years. Then, in October 2019, China Eximbank reportedly halted loan disbursements due to concerns that the Government of Zambia would default on its repayment obligations. Then, on July 29, 2022, the Ministry of Finance & National Planning (MOFNP) of Zambia announced that it was seeking lender approval to formally cancel the PBC’s undisbursed balance ($77,190,000.00); however, it also noted that it had not yet secured formal lender approval for this action. This announcement came approximately 21 months after the Government of Zambia defaulted on its repayment obligations to Eurobond holders and approximately 6 weeks after China, France, and 14 other countries formed a creditor committee to discuss the Zambian authorities’ request for a debt treatment under ‘the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the DSSI’ endorsed by the G20 and the Paris Club. MOFNP also announced on July 29, 2022 that it planned to finance the completion of the Kenneth Kaunda International Airport (KKIA) Airport Expansion Project with general government revenues, and it signaled its intention to rescope the project to focus on the construction of the old terminal building and the extension of the runway and lighting system.",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,General Infrastructure,Project focuses on airport expansion and related facilities without clear environmental or energy transition impacts,"Construction of new terminal, commercial complex, hotel, and rehabilitation of existing terminal; no mention of energy transition components"
