96209,BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES,SBP makes RMB 20 billion drawdown under currency swap agreement with PBOC in Fiscal Year 2019,"On December 23, 2011, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) signed an RMB 10 billion (PKR 140 billion), three-year bilateral currency swap agreement to facilitate trade and improve foreign currency liquidity in Pakistan. The agreement was renewed on December 23, 2014 for a period of three years with overall limit of RMB 10 billion (PKR 165 billion). It was further extended on May 23, 2018 for another three years, with the amount being increased to RMB 20 billion (PKR 351 billion). It was again extended (renewed) on July 31, 2020, during the Government of Pakistan’s Fiscal Year 2021, with maximum drawing rights increased to RMB 30 billion (PKR 720 billion). During the Government of Pakistan’s Fiscal Year 2013 (July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013), the SBP made a (gross) drawdown under the currency swap agreement equivalent to RMB 5 billion ($819.35 million). The Fiscal Year 2013 drawdown (borrowing), which is captured via Project ID#89452, carried a 1-year (12-month) maturity and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin. The PBOC credited RMB 5 billion to the SBP’s account held with PBOC, and the SBP credited PBOC's account held with SBP with the PKR equivalent of RMB 5 billion (PKR 70 billion). The SBP reportedly used the funds that it borrowed from PBOC to address its balance of payments (BOP) needs. In late 2013, the IMF expressed concern about the SBP’s heavy reliance on short-term currency swaps and forward contracts to boost gross foreign exchange reserves, and recommended that they be gradually scaled back to limit risk.  The SBP made additional (gross) drawdowns under its currency swap agreement with the PBOC between Fiscal Year 2014 (July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014) and Fiscal Year 2022 (July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022): an RMB 6.5 billion drawdown in Fiscal Year 2014 that carried an estimated maturity of 9 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin, an RMB 10 billion drawdown in Fiscal Year 2015 that carried an estimated maturity of 4 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin, an RMB 10 billion drawdown in Fiscal Year 2016 that carried an estimated maturity of 4 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin, an RMB 10 billion drawdown in Fiscal Year 2017 that carried an estimated maturity of 4.5 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin, an RMB 20 billion drawdown in Fiscal Year 2018 that carried an estimated maturity of 7.5 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin, an RMB 20 billion in Fiscal Year 2019 that carried an estimated maturity of 7.5 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin, an RMB 20 billion in Fiscal Year 2020 that carried an estimated maturity of 7.5 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin, an RMB 30 billion in Fiscal Year 2021 that carried an estimated maturity of 7.5 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin, and an RMB 30 billion in Fiscal Year 2022 that carried an estimated maturity of 7.5 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin.

A bilateral currency swap (BCS) agreement — also known as a central bank liquidity swap agreement — is an agreement between the central banks of two countries to exchange cash flows in different currencies at predetermined rates over a specified period of time. Central banks participate in these agreements to facilitate bilateral trade settlements using their national currencies (rather than relying upon on a third-party currency such as the U.S. dollar), manage demands from their local banks, and provide liquidity support to financial markets. The party that draws down on the swap line becomes the borrower and the other party becomes lender. During the term of the swap, the party that draws down on the swap line makes either fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amount. If both parties draw down on the swap line, then both parties exchange fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amounts. The 5-step process of drawing upon a currency swap line with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) can described from the perspective of an importer in a given country (‘Country X’) seeking to settle trade with a Chinese firm in RMB. Step 1: The central bank of Country X and the PBOC activate their currency swap in advance, at which point each party deposits a specific amount of its currency in an account controlled by the other party (i.e. the central bank of Country X deposits local currency in an account controlled by the PBOC, and the PBOC deposits an equivalent amount in RMB in an account controlled by the central bank of Country X). Step 2: A firm in Country X that imports goods from China applies for an RMB-denominated loan from a domestic bank. Step 3: The domestic bank in Country X that receives the loan application then applies to its central bank for an RMB-denominated loan. After a review process, the central bank of Country X notifies the domestic bank applicant that its loan application was approved. The central bank of Country X subsequently requests that the PBOC transfer RMB funds from the central bank of Country X’s swap account within the PBOC to the loan applicant’s account with a corresponding bank in China. Step 4: The domestic bank in Country X directs the corresponding bank in China to transfer RMB funds into a Chinese exporter’s account, and the corresponding bank in China provides RMB funds to the Chinese exporter. Step 5: The importer in Country X repays the RMB-denominated loan at its maturity date. The domestic bank notifies the central bank of Country X of the repayment, and transfers RMB into the central bank’s account within the PBOC through the corresponding bank in China. For the central bank of Country X, the RMB deposit is an asset that should be recorded on its balance sheet as an official reserve asset denominated in RMB. The contra entry of this asset is the liability in the local currency of Country X that represents China’s claims in the central bank of Country X. This should be also recorded on the balance sheet of the central bank of Country X. At the time of the exchange of currencies, it should be recorded as an increase in assets and an increase in liabilities of the monetary authorities in the balance of payments. The reason why the PBOC uses this mechanism to provide renminbi liquidity to other central bank is to increase the speed, convenience, and volume of transactions between the two countries. More detailed information about currency swaps with the PBOC can be found at https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021210-print-pdf.ashx and https://thechinaguys.com/the-rise-of-the-renminbi-the-reality-of-bilateral-swap-agreements/ and https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2017/pdf/17-25a.pdf.   2. AidData treats drawdowns under BCS agreements with the PBOC as collateralized loans because, in a BCS arrangement, the currency of the borrower is held as collateral while the lender receives interest on the amount drawn down by the borrower until repayment is made.   3. The precise maturity length that applies to the SBP’s FY19 borrowing is unknown. According to the SBP Fiscal Year 2019 Annual Report, ‘[t]he [SBP] has purchased and utilized CNY 20,000 million against PKR during the year with the maturity buckets of three months to 1 year (2018: CNY 20,000 million with maturity bucket of three months to 1 year). These purchases have been fully utilized as on June 30, 2019 and the same amounts are outstanding as on June 30, 2019. Interest is charged on outstanding balance at agreed rates..’ AidData has coded the maturity length as 7.5 months (0.625 years) for the time being.   4. Most central banks publish their end-of-year outstanding PBOC swap debt, but only a few report detailed transaction-level data on drawdowns during the year. Therefore, if no information on drawings is available, AidData assumes that total drawdowns during the reporting period equal the amount outstanding at the end of the reporting period (and vice versa). Since the (de jure) maturities of PBOC swap drawings are 12 months or less, this creates a lower bound estimate for actual drawdowns under the PBOC swap line.   5. PBOC swap debt is frequently rolled over. In central bank reports where one can only observe the year-end outstanding amount, no distinction between rollovers and drawdowns is possible. In these cases, one can derive (new) drawdowns as the difference between the current and last year’s outstanding swap debt stock. This measure essentially captures net lending through the PBOC swap line.","# Sector

PMLTC is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and joint venture between China Chengxin International Ltd. (69.98% equity stake), China Excellence International Ltd. (30% equity stake), and the SPV’s directors (0.02% equity stake). It is responsible for constructing and operating an 878 km power transmission line from Matiari, Sindh (South of Pakistan) to Nankana Sahib, Lahore (North Punjab). The total cost of the 878 km Matiari-Lahore Transmission Line Project, which is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and the Belt and Road Initiative, was $1,658,340,000. It was implemented as an Independent Power Project (IPP) — on a Build, Own, Operate and Transfer (‘BOOT’) basis — and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. The debt component is captured in Project ID#54013 and the equity component is captured in Project ID#53695.   On November 9, 2018, China Development Bank (CDB) Sichuan Branch signed a $1.326 billion overseas investment loan agreement with PMLTC for the 878 km Matiari-Lahore Transmission Line Project. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 10-year maturity length, a 2.25-year grace period (27 months), a 5.64% all-in interest rate (LIBOR plus 4.5% margin), a 1% upfront (management) fee, and a 0.2% commitment fee. Sinosure provided overseas investment insurance for this loan at a maximum rate of 0.60% per annum. The Government of Pakistan also issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan and a 17% guaranteed return on equity (ROE) to the investors in the BOOT project. State Grid International Engineering Ltd. — the overseas investment company of State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) — agreed to provide approximately $332 million in equity financing through two unspecified special purpose vehicles (SPVs). Financial close was achieved on February 27, 2019.   The purpose of the project was to construct an 878 km, 660 kV, High Voltage Direct Current Line (HVDC) that transmits 4,000MW of electricity (mainly from coal) from the Chinese bank-financed Thar Block-1 Integrated Coal Mine and Power Project (captured via Project ID#53674), the Thar Block-2 Coal Mine and Power Project (captured via Project ID#54314, #35127, and #54315) and the Chinese bank-financed Port Qasim Power Project (captured via Project ID#52904) to the northern parts of Pakistan (near Lahore). The starting point of the transmission line is at the Matiari Converter Station about 15 kilometers northeast of Matiari in Sindh Province, and the end point is at the Lahore Converter Station at a distance of about 40 kilometers southwest of Lahore in Punjab Province.  China Electric Power Equipment and Technology Co. Ltd. (CET) — a wholly owned subsidiary of State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) — is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Under the terms of the BOOT contract, CET will operate the Matiari-Lahore transmission line for 25 years and transfer it afterwards to the National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC), the Pakistani government-owned power transmission company. A project commencement ceremony took place on December 1, 2018. PMLTC also issued a notice to proceed (NTP) to CET for the commencement of EPC works on December 1, 2018. The project achieved mechanical completion in October 2020. It successfully completed equipment debugging, sub-system commissioning, and station commissioning with a certificate of readiness for interconnection and a certificate of readiness issued on December 1, 2020.   The project’s originally expected commercial operations date (COD) was March 1, 2021, but due to delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the project ultimately reached its COD on September 1, 2021. The transmission line is currently operational. However, various problems arose during project implementation. On November 30, 2020, NTDC and PMLTC acknowledged that there was a defect in the transmission line, which emerged during low power testing. Additionally, the certificate of readiness issued on December 01, 2020, was later declared null and void upon the failure of the low power test due to frequency oscillation on December 2, 2020, and a notice of dispute in the matter was served to the PMLTC by NTDC. The matter was resolved between the parties through Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated February 18, 2021 without a declaration of the force majeure events and both parties agreed to extend the COD until September 1, 2021.   The project has also encountered debt repayment and financial management challenges. In May 2022, reports emerged that the Government of Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to PMLTC. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 14.5 billion (approximately $72.5 million). Then, in June 2022, the Private Power & Infrastructure Board (PPIB) requested that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) make available foreign exchange so that PMLTC could make a $6.31 million Sinosure fee payment. In a letter to SBP’s Executive Director ofFinancial Market and Reserve Management (dated June 24, 2022), PMLTC noted a significant delay in approval by SBP of the $6.31 million payment request filed by the company on May 9, 2022. It also noted that late payment could result in a material breach of Sinosure policy leading to a contractual breach under financing documents. PPIB also noted that non-availability of requisite foreign currency could result in the lapse of consent under the Implementation Agreement (IA), which could in turn expose the Government of Pakistan to litigation. According to PPIB, pursuant to provisions of the IA, it is the responsibility of Government of Pakistan to make available through SBP the foreign currency not available through normal banking channels within the specified time for payment in foreign currency related to the projects, including the payment of premiums and fees to offshore insurers and reinsurers.   Then, in July 2022, Zhang Li (CEO of PMLTC) wrote a letter to the Managing Director of the PPIB, warning that the Government of Pakistan’s imposition of 17 percent general sales tax (GST) on transmission service charges (through amendments to the Finance Act, 2022 and Sales Tax Act, 1990) would have ‘severe financial implications’ for PMLTC. Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this “[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).","1. This project is also known as the Matiari-Lahore HVDC Transmission Project.

The first reason is that ICBC was selected as the security agent (i.e. collateral agent) for the loan, and when lenders take collateral as security for their loans, a collateral/security agent is often appointed to enforce rights against the collateral in the event of the borrower’s default under the loan. The second reason is the lender requirement that the borrower maintain a minimum cash deposit in an escrow (revolving) account. 3.

Then, in September 2017, the Power Division forwarded a draft Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) to be signed between Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guaranteed (CPPA-G) and power producer(s) to the Finance Division. CPPA-G subsequently executed the finalized draft of RAA with multiple CPEC IPPs. The Government of Pakistan also guaranteed the funding obligations of the CPPA with respect to the RAA, through Supplemental Implementation Agreements signed between the Government of Pakistan — through the Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) — and the respective IPPs.","# Sector

[CPEC, IPP] CDB provides $1.326 billion overseas investment loan for 878 km Matiari-Lahore Transmission Line Project (Linked to Project ID#53695)

# Description
On May 14, 2018, the National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC) — a Pakistani government-owned power transmission company — and Pak Matiari-Lahore Transmission Company (Private) Limited (PMLTC or Pak MLTC) signed an Implementation Agreement (IA) and a Transmission Services Agreement (TSA) for the 878 km Matiari-Lahore Transmission Line Project. PMLTC is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and joint venture between China Chengxin International Ltd. (69.98% equity stake), China Excellence International Ltd. (30% equity stake), and the SPV’s directors (0.02% equity stake). It is responsible for constructing and operating an 878 km power transmission line from Matiari, Sindh (South of Pakistan) to Nankana Sahib, Lahore (North Punjab). The total cost of the 878 km Matiari-Lahore Transmission Line Project, which is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and the Belt and Road Initiative, was $1,658,340,000. It was implemented as an Independent Power Project (IPP) — on a Build, Own, Operate and Transfer (‘BOOT’) basis — and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. The debt component is captured in Project ID#54013 and the equity component is captured in Project ID#53695.   On November 9, 2018, China Development Bank (CDB) Sichuan Branch signed a $1.326 billion overseas investment loan agreement with PMLTC for the 878 km Matiari-Lahore Transmission Line Project. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 10-year maturity length, a 2.25-year grace period (27 months), a 5.64% all-in interest rate (LIBOR plus 4.5% margin), a 1% upfront (management) fee, and a 0.2% commitment fee. Sinosure provided overseas investment insurance for this loan at a maximum rate of 0.60% per annum. The Government of Pakistan also issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan and a 17% guaranteed return on equity (ROE) to the investors in the BOOT project. State Grid International Engineering Ltd. — the overseas investment company of State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) — agreed to provide approximately $332 million in equity financing through two unspecified special purpose vehicles (SPVs). Financial close was achieved on February 27, 2019.   The purpose of the project was to construct an 878 km, 660 kV, High Voltage Direct Current Line (HVDC) that transmits 4,000MW of electricity (mainly from coal) from the Chinese bank-financed Thar Block-1 Integrated Coal Mine and Power Project (captured via Project ID#53674), the Thar Block-2 Coal Mine and Power Project (captured via Project ID#54314, #35127, and #54315) and the Chinese bank-financed Port Qasim Power Project (captured via Project ID#52904) to the northern parts of Pakistan (near Lahore). The starting point of the transmission line is at the Matiari Converter Station about 15 kilometers northeast of Matiari in Sindh Province, and the end point is at the Lahore Converter Station at a distance of about 40 kilometers southwest of Lahore in Punjab Province.  China Electric Power Equipment and Technology Co. Ltd. (CET) — a wholly owned subsidiary of State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) — is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Under the terms of the BOOT contract, CET will operate the Matiari-Lahore transmission line for 25 years and transfer it afterwards to the National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC), the Pakistani government-owned power transmission company. A project commencement ceremony took place on December 1, 2018. PMLTC also issued a notice to proceed (NTP) to CET for the commencement of EPC works on December 1, 2018. The project achieved mechanical completion in October 2020. It successfully completed equipment debugging, sub-system commissioning, and station commissioning with a certificate of readiness for interconnection and a certificate of readiness issued on December 1, 2020.   The project’s originally expected commercial operations date (COD) was March 1, 2021, but due to delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the project ultimately reached its COD on September 1, 2021. The transmission line is currently operational. However, various problems arose during project implementation. On November 30, 2020, NTDC and PMLTC acknowledged that there was a defect in the transmission line, which emerged during low power testing. Additionally, the certificate of readiness issued on December 01, 2020, was later declared null and void upon the failure of the low power test due to frequency oscillation on December 2, 2020, and a notice of dispute in the matter was served to the PMLTC by NTDC. The matter was resolved between the parties through Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated February 18, 2021 without a declaration of the force majeure events and both parties agreed to extend the COD until September 1, 2021.

Then, on September 30, 2016, Pakistan’s Private Power & Infrastructure Board (PPIB) awarded TEL a generation license for the development of this 330 MW coal-based conventional steam turbine generation facility/thermal power plant. Several months later, on December 9, 2016, PPIB issued a Letter of Support (LOS) to TEL, requiring it to (i) achieve Financial Close (FC) for the project no later than nine months from the date of LOS and (ii) enter into the Implementation Agreement (IA), Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) and Water Use Agreement (WUA) no later than three months prior to the FC date. TEL executed an Implementation Agreement with PPIB on November 10, 2017. TEL also executed a Power Purchase Agreement, Water Use Agreement and Coal Supply Agreement on July 27, 2017, October 17, 2017 and May 13, 2017, respectively. Then, on March 15, 2018, Hub Power Company (Hubco) signed a shareholders’ agreement with Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited (FFC) and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC). Under the terms of this agreement, Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited (FFC) and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) Tel Power Investments Limited purchased 30% and 10% equity stakes, respectively, in TEL from HUBCO.   The total cost of Phase 1 of the 330 MW Thar Block 2 (TEL 1) Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project, which is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative and the Belt and Road Initiative, was $520 million. It was implemented as an Independent Power Project (IPP) and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25.  On December 20, 2018, TEL — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture between HUBCO (60% ownership stake), FFC (30% ownership stake), and CMEC Tel Power Investments Limited (10% ownership stake) — signed two loan agreements worth $390 million for Phase 1 of the 330 MW Thar Block 2 (TEL 1) Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project: a $260 million syndicated loan facility agreement with CDB and China Minsheng Bank Corporation Limited (CMBC) and a PKR-denominated syndicated loan facility (worth $130 million) with HBL, Bank Alfalah Limited, Bank Al-Habib Limited, National Bank of Pakistan, Soneri Bank Limited, Faysal Bank Limited, and Sindh Bank Limited. The remaining project cost ($130 million) was provided by the project sponsors via equity infusions. The estimated borrowing terms of the syndicated loan from CDB and CMBC are as follows: a 10 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, a 5.8% interest rate, and a 5% Sinosure insurance premium. The Government of Pakistan issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. Sinosure also provided credit insurance (95% political risk coverage and 65% commercial risk coverage). The estimated cost of the Sinosure credit insurance policy is 7% of the borrower’s total debt service to CDB and CMBC. Additionally, as a source of security (collateral) for the syndicated loan from CDB and CMBC, the owners of TEL pledged their shares (equity stakes) in the project company. The proceeds of the loan were used to finance at least two commercial contracts: a $262.5 million commercial contract with CMEC (with a 32 month work period) that was signed on May 26, 2018 and a commercial contract (with an unspecified monetary value) with Hebei Engineering Company that was signed on on December 14, 2018.    The purpose of Phase 1 was to construct a 330MW mine-mouth coal-fired power plant in Thar Block II, near the villages of Singharo-Bitra in Taluka Islamkot within the district of Tharparkar in Sindh Province. The power plant was to be fueled by a coal mine also in Thar Block II operated by Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC). The coal mine has 3.8 million tons per annum capacity. China Machinery and Engineering Corporation (CMEC) — a subsidiary of Sinomach and 10% stakeholder in TEL — was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Project implementation commenced in 2018, but the precise start date is unknown. The power station entered partial commercial operations in July 2019, and the coal mine is currently in the operational test phase. As of October 2021, Phase 1 was nearing completion. CDB also financed Phase 2 of this project (as captured via Project ID#89499).","1.

According to multiple, official sources, the Government of Pakistan has issued sovereign guarantees in support of all loans issued by Chinese state-owned banks for independent power projects (IPPs) in Pakistan (see https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cepk/chn/zbgx/t1735166.htm and http://pk.chineseembassy.org/eng/zbgx/202110/t20211010_9558510.htm and https://www.dropbox.com/s/bmx3w2b38o7guxm/Debt%20Pricing%20of%20IPPs%20%28002%29.pdf?dl=0). As such, AidData assumes that the loan captured in this record is backed by a sovereign guarantee from the Government of Pakistan. 3. The loan that was issued by CDB was very likely a buyer's credit since it is (1) denominated in USD, (2) the lender stated it would not cover more than 85% of the commercial contract; which is standard for export buyer's credits, and (3) Sinosure provided credit insurance. 4. This appears to be a separate project from the 2 x 330 MW Engro Thar Block II Coal Power Project implemented by Engro Powergen Thar Limited (EPTL), captured via Project ID#35127.

There is a second phase of the mine construction that will supply coal to this project, it is unclear how the second phase of the mine is financed. 5. On November 10, 2017, Pakistan's PPIB and HUBCO signed an implementation agreement and supplemental implementation agreement. This might be when the plans were revised and the price rose from $497 million to $520 million. 6. AidData codes this transaction as a collateralized loan because Habib Bank was selected as the security agent (i.e. collateral agent) for the loan. When lenders take collateral as security for their loans, a collateral/security agent is often appointed to enforce rights against the collateral in the event of the borrower’s default under the loan. 7. The size of the contributions from CDB and CMBC to the $260 million syndicated loan are unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes that CDB and CMBC each contributed $130 million. 8. According to a Pakistan National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) document dated June 7, 2017 (see source #61616), Phase 1 was originally projected to have a total project cost of $497.70 million with a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25. At the time, China Development Bank (CDB), the Export-Import Bank of China, and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) expressed their willingness to finance the $373.3 million debt component (p. 6). Thar Energy Limited told NEPRA that they could not secure the entire debt financing from Chinese banks as Sinosure would only guarantee up to 85% of the value of the EPC contract value (p.7). HUBCO engaged CDB as the lead arranger for foreign financing and Habib Bank Limited (HBL) as the lead arranger for local financing. After June 2017, sometime during subsequent financial negotiations and planning, the total project cost increased to $520 million and ICBC and China Eximbank stepped aside. The debt-to-equity ratio stayed at 75:25 meaning the debt component increased to $390 million. 9.

[CPEC, IPP] CDB contributes to $260 million syndicated loan for Phase 1 of 330 MW Thar Block 2 (TEL 1) Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#89499)

# Description
On May 17, 2016, a special purpose vehicle called Thar Energy Limited (TEL) — a wholly owned subsidiary of Hub Power Company (Hubco) — was incorporated in Pakistan in order to develop, own, operate and maintain a 330MW mine–mouth coal fired power plant at Thar Block II (Thar Coal Mine) in Sindh Province. Then, on September 30, 2016, Pakistan’s Private Power & Infrastructure Board (PPIB) awarded TEL a generation license for the development of this 330 MW coal-based conventional steam turbine generation facility/thermal power plant. Several months later, on December 9, 2016, PPIB issued a Letter of Support (LOS) to TEL, requiring it to (i) achieve Financial Close (FC) for the project no later than nine months from the date of LOS and (ii) enter into the Implementation Agreement (IA), Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) and Water Use Agreement (WUA) no later than three months prior to the FC date. TEL executed an Implementation Agreement with PPIB on November 10, 2017. TEL also executed a Power Purchase Agreement, Water Use Agreement and Coal Supply Agreement on July 27, 2017, October 17, 2017 and May 13, 2017, respectively. Then, on March 15, 2018, Hub Power Company (Hubco) signed a shareholders’ agreement with Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited (FFC) and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC). Under the terms of this agreement, Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited (FFC) and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) Tel Power Investments Limited purchased 30% and 10% equity stakes, respectively, in TEL from HUBCO.   The total cost of Phase 1 of the 330 MW Thar Block 2 (TEL 1) Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project, which is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative and the Belt and Road Initiative, was $520 million. It was implemented as an Independent Power Project (IPP) and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25.  On December 20, 2018, TEL — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture between HUBCO (60% ownership stake), FFC (30% ownership stake), and CMEC Tel Power Investments Limited (10% ownership stake) — signed two loan agreements worth $390 million for Phase 1 of the 330 MW Thar Block 2 (TEL 1) Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project: a $260 million syndicated loan facility agreement with CDB and China Minsheng Bank Corporation Limited (CMBC) and a PKR-denominated syndicated loan facility (worth $130 million) with HBL, Bank Alfalah Limited, Bank Al-Habib Limited, National Bank of Pakistan, Soneri Bank Limited, Faysal Bank Limited, and Sindh Bank Limited. The remaining project cost ($130 million) was provided by the project sponsors via equity infusions. The estimated borrowing terms of the syndicated loan from CDB and CMBC are as follows: a 10 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, a 5.8% interest rate, and a 5% Sinosure insurance premium. The Government of Pakistan issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. Sinosure also provided credit insurance (95% political risk coverage and 65% commercial risk coverage). The estimated cost of the Sinosure credit insurance policy is 7% of the borrower’s total debt service to CDB and CMBC. Additionally, as a source of security (collateral) for the syndicated loan from CDB and CMBC, the owners of TEL pledged their shares (equity stakes) in the project company. The proceeds of the loan were used to finance at least two commercial contracts: a $262.5 million commercial contract with CMEC (with a 32 month work period) that was signed on May 26, 2018 and a commercial contract (with an unspecified monetary value) with Hebei Engineering Company that was signed on on December 14, 2018.    The purpose of Phase 1 was to construct a 330MW mine-mouth coal-fired power plant in Thar Block II, near the villages of Singharo-Bitra in Taluka Islamkot within the district of Tharparkar in Sindh Province. The power plant was to be fueled by a coal mine also in Thar Block II operated by Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC). The coal mine has 3.8 million tons per annum capacity. China Machinery and Engineering Corporation (CMEC) — a subsidiary of Sinomach and 10% stakeholder in TEL — was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Project implementation commenced in 2018, but the precise start date is unknown. The power station entered partial commercial operations in July 2019, and the coal mine is currently in the operational test phase. As of October 2021, Phase 1 was nearing completion.
