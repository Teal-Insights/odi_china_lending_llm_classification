On December 31, 2015, 1MDB — a Malaysia state investment fund — signed a Sale and Purchase Agreement with ICSB for the sale of 60% equity in Bandar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. (BMSB). As part of this agreement, ICSB paid a 10% (RM 741 million) deposit, which was channelled to 1MDB (the parent company of TRXC at the time) to help it meet its outstanding debt obligations. ICSB valued 100% of Bandar Malaysia's land at RM 12.35 billion, and by extension, 60% of its land at RM 7.41 billion.   Then, on June 16, 2016, Bank of China (BOC), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), and China Construction Bank (CCB) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) expressing their intent in providing a loan to ICSB for the Bandar Malaysia Development Project. During the same month, BOC, ICBC, and CCB signed a syndicated overseas investment loan agreement with ICSB worth RM 3 billion to facilitate its acquisition of a 60% equity stake in BMSB and finance associated project costs. The loan carried a 5-year maturity, but its interest rate and grace period are unknown. ICBC served as the mandated lead arranger of the syndicated loan. On June 16, 2016, CREC also agreed to make a $2 billion investment in ICSB (captured via Project ID#70527).   However, on May 3, 2017, TRXC notified ICSB that it had failed to meet the requirements of the agreement reached on December 31, 2015 and the acquisition was being terminated. TRXC refunded the RM 741 million deposit. Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance had to step in to advance the amount to TRXC as the funds were earlier used to pay 1MDB obligations. Then, in June 2017, Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance issued a Request For Proposal (RFP) for Fortune 500 companies or international real estate companies to take on the role of master developer of the Bandar Malaysia Development Project. However, a qualified company was not identified.   Then, on April 25, 2019, during the second “Belt and Road” International Cooperation Summit Forum, witnessed by the prime ministers of China and Malaysia, CREC President Zhang Zongyan and Malaysian Minister of Economic Affairs Azmin Azmin signed a framework agreement for the ‘restoration’ of the Bandar Malaysia Development Project. Two days later, on April 27, 2019, CREC announced that it would resume its participation in the acquisition of the Bandar Malaysia Development Project and maintain the original purchase price and shareholding structure. Then, on December 17, 2019, TRXC sold a 60% equity stake in BMSB to ICSB for RM 7.41 billion after the parties inked a restated shared and amended share sale agreement and shareholder agreement.  The purpose of the Bandar Malaysia project is to construct 10,000 affordable housing units on a 486-acre site and an 85-acre park for the public. The project site is located in the the heart of Kuala Lumpur at the site of Royal Malaysian Air Force base on Jalan Sg Besi. The project officially commenced on April 1, 2017. Project implementation was delayed in May 2017 due to a contractual dispute. The project was restarted in April 2019.

He also conveyed the Chinese Government’s interest in financing the construction of the bridge. On December 2, 2014, the Chinese and Maldivian governments signed an MOU for the project’s pre-feasibility study. Then, on July 9, 2015, the Chinese and Maldivian governments signed additional MoUs related to the project. The total cost of the project of the project was approximately RMB 1.26 billion ($222.4 million).

The borrower did not make any repayments to China Eximbank during calendar year 2020 or calendar year 2021.

The bridge also sought to connect the international airport to the capital city of Malé. The bridge is 2,000 meters long, of which 1,390 meters consists of a cross-sea bridge. It is 20 meters in width. The 760-meter long main bridge is a six-span steel tube-reinforced hybrid girder V-shaped rigid frame bridge.

Then, during Xi Jinping's September 2014 state visit to the Maldives, Xi suggested that the bridge would be called ‘the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge'. He also conveyed the Chinese Government’s interest in financing the construction of the bridge. On December 2, 2014, the Chinese and Maldivian governments signed an MOU for the project’s pre-feasibility study. Then, on July 9, 2015, the Chinese and Maldivian governments signed additional MoUs related to the project. The total cost of the project of the project was approximately RMB 1.26 billion ($222.4 million). It was financed with an RMB 724,500,000 ($126 million) grant from China’s Ministry of Commerce, an RMB 455,600,000 loan from China Eximbank, and 80,640,000 ($12.6 million) from the Maldivian state budget.   On July 14, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of the Maldives signed an RMB 455,600,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Sinamalé Bridge (China-Maldives Friendship Bridge) Construction Project.

China Eximbank made loan disbursements worth MVR 262,449,478 in 2016 and MVR 261,058,800 in 2017. The loan had achieved a 100% disbursement rate (RMB 455,600,000 out of RMB 455,600,000) and its amount outstanding was RMB 455,600,000 as of December 31, 2019.   The purpose of the project was to construct Sinamalé Bridge (‘the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge') in order to link the islands of Malé, Hulhulé and Hulhumalé (through Hulhulé') in the Maldives. The bridge also sought to connect the international airport to the capital city of Malé. The bridge is 2,000 meters long, of which 1,390 meters consists of a cross-sea bridge. It is 20 meters in width. The 760-meter long main bridge is a six-span steel tube-reinforced hybrid girder V-shaped rigid frame bridge. The whole bridge contains six deck closure sections, including three concrete girder deck closure sections and three steel box girder closure sections. The project required a total of 460 tons of 316L stainless steel plate embedded parts.

The loan carries the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3% margin, a 14.5-year maturity (final maturity date: July 31, 2031), and an estimated grace period of 3 years. The Ministry of Finance and Treasury of the Government of Maldives provided a sovereign guarantee for this loan. The borrower also purchased buyer’s credit insurance from Sinosure. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance a $90 million EPC turnkey contract between STELCO and Dongfang Electric International Corporation (DEC), which was signed on May 28, 2015.   The loan had achieved a 74% disbursement rate ($55,860,790 out of $75,395,226) as of September 2018 and a 100% disbursement rate as of December 2019 ($75,395,226 out of $75,395,226). The borrower made loan repayments to China Eximbank worth $6,282,935 during calendar year 2020 and $1,884,881 during calendar year 2021. The loan’s outstanding amount was $10,627,589 as of December 31, 2017, $37,584,605 as of December 31, 2018, $75,395,226 (MVR 1,118,854,580) as of December 31, 2019, $69,112,290 (MVR 1,081,698,614) as of December 31, 2020, and $67,227,410 as of December 31, 2021.    The project involved the construction of a diesel engine power plant with an installed capacity of 50MW and two sets of seawater desalination systems each with a capacity of 960 tons per day (by utilizing flue gas from the power plant). Once operational, the power plant was expected to provide sufficient electricity to satisfy the demand of consumers for economic and social development in the greater Malé region, as well as guarantee a supply of power transmission in the area. The plant was also expected to become a supply of fresh water for residents, tourists, and industry. The Maldivian reported that the plant would guarantee electricity coverage for the next 10 to 20 years for Malé and Hulhumalé. The power plant was also expected to provide electricity to Malé and Hulhumalé via an interconnection through the China Eximbank-financed Malé-Hulhumalé Bridge (China-Maldives Friendship Bridge) (captured via Project ID#54280).

The project was ultimately completed on July 22, 2019, 38 days ahead of what was scheduled in the contract (August 29, 2019).   However, there are some indications that the China Eximbank and Bank of China loan for STELCO’s 5th Power Development Project may have financially underperformed. During the calendar year 2020, the loan’s guarantor (the Ministry of Finance and Treasury of the Government of Maldives) made an MVR 154,007,552 capital contribution to STELCO to ensure that it could honor its repayment obligations to China Eximbank and Bank of China. Repayments also declined from $6,282,935 during calendar year 2020 to $1,884,881 during calendar year 2021.","1.
