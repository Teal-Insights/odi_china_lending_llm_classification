Once completed, the refinery was planned to be operated by the Iraqi-state owned Missan Oil Company (MOC) on behalf of owners Wahan, a Chinese company, (85%) and Satarem (15%).  The project's cornerstone laying ceremony was held on February 25, 2016. According to the 2018-2022 National Development Plan from Iraq's Ministry of Planning, the refinery was expected to become operational in 2022. However, the project stalled. On January 4, 2018, Iraq's Ministry of Oil announced that it had required Missan International Refinery Company (MIRC) (Satarem) to sign an undertaking that it would begin work on the refinery within 30 days.

The name of the refinery in Arabic is مصفى ميسان.Iraq's National Investment Commission ('Maysan Province') reports that this project cost $5.755 billion USD, but $6 billion USD is the more commonly, consistently reported figure for the approximate cost of this project.It is unclear when CDB and China Eximbank provided the loan for this project (as these are banks, AidData has assumed the flow type was a loan). 'UPDATE: Construction begins on new Missan refinery', which was published in late February 2016, includes a statement from Iraq's Deputy Oil Minister for Refineries asserting that CDB and China Eximbank would be funding the project, suggesting that the banks committed financing prior to that point. However, the exact time of signing is unknown, so AidData has coded 2016 as the commitment year and set the year_uncertain field to True.AidData has assumed Satarem was the recipient of this loan, as 'UPDATE: Construction begins on new Missan refinery' explicitly states that the Government of Iraq and Iraqi banks were not contributing to this project; it would be highly unusual for the loan to go to the Government of Iraq if this was the case.Lastly, there are grave concerns amongst members of the media about Satarem and Wahan. For one, Satarem was legally bankrupt, its assets liquidated and removed from the official Swiss registry of company at the time of cornerstone laying ceremony in February 2016. Satarem has since operated as/thorough Missan International Refinery Company (MIRC) it implement the project. For Wahan's part, there is a claim that Wahan is, in fact, fictional. The evidence for this comes from the fact that, despite owning 85% of the refinery, Wahan was never mentioned or represented at key signing ceremonies, presentations, and meetings (see pg.4 of 'Satarem-Missan Refinery Scandalous Contract Gets Final Termination Notice'). AidData has been unable to confirm this claim.","# Sector

The EPC contract went into effect on March 8, 2016. Project implementation was still ongoing as of August 2, 2019.","1. In Chinese, a deferred payment agreement is known as 延期付款协议. 2. In a typical receivables financing agreement (or deferred payment agreement), the company that the project owner in the host country has selected as its engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor is also a lender to the project owner. The company assigns receivables under its EPC contract with the project owner to one of or more banks. Upon assignment of receivables, the bank or banks will release funds to the company so it can discharge its obligations under the receivables financing agreement  as a lender. Receivables financing is also known as accounts receivable financing (finance) or A/R financing (finance) or 应收账款融资 (in Chinese). These other terms are used because the accounts receivable of a company (i.e., unpaid invoices) are being used as collateral to unlock working capital—typically in the form of a bank loan (‘receivables loan’). Sellers often face cash flow problems when their buyers do not make full payment at the due date of the invoice. A receivables financing arrangement addresses this problem by allowing them to sell their outstanding invoices to a bank at a discounted rate. This approach allows the seller to receive the remaining invoice amount before the due date of the invoice. The bank either gets its money back at invoice maturity through the seller (acting as a collecting agent) or directly from the debtor. 3. More likely than not, a Chinese state-owned bank signed an accounts receivable transfer agreement with CPECC to provide financing for the construction period of the project. In this type of arrangement, the exporter (seller) procures insurance from Sinosure and transfers its accounts receivable under the insurance policy to a bank. The bank then grants financing to the exporter (seller) and becomes the insured under the transferred insurance policy. When an insured loss occurs, Sinosure pays indemnity to the financing bank pursuant to the insurance policy and the Accounts Receivable Transfer Agreement. However, this issue requires further investigation.4. This project is also known as the Rehabilitation Of Iraq South Gas Facilities Project, the Basrah Gas Company/Shell South Gas Facilities Rehabilitation Project, the BGC Rehabilitation Portfolio HP-Lpg Project, the Rehabilitation of Iraq South Gas Facilities West Qurna Unit Project.
