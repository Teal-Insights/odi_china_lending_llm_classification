# Description
On January 9, 2017, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) signed a syndicated loan agreement worth $1.416 billion to SK Hydro (Private) Limited (SKHPL) -- a special purpose vehicle -- for the 870.25 MW Suki Kinari Hydropower Project.

Ltd. (CPHGC) signed a $1,496,000,000 syndicated loan agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned banks — including China Development Bank (CDB, lead arranger), the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank, co-lead arranger), the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Construction Bank Corporation (CCB), and Bank of Communications Co. Limited (BOCOM) — for the 2×660MW Imported Coal Based Independent Power Generation Project at Hub. According to CPHGC's upfront tariff application to Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority, the estimated borrowing terms of the syndicated loan are as follows: a maturity period of 14 years, a grace period of 4 years, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 450 basis points (4.5%). The borrower purchased buyer's credit insurance from Sinosure. As sources of collateral, the borrower also pledged shareholdings, assets, accounts, electricity payment receivables, and its Sinosure insurance policy.

CCB's contribution is captured via Project ID#92390. BOCOM's contribution is captured via Project ID#92391.   The total cost of this independent power project (IPP) was $1.995 billion and it was financed according to a 75:25 debt-to-equity ratio. CPHGC is a project company and joint venture of China Power International Holding Ltd (CPIH) and the Hub Power Company Limited (HUBCO) that was established to finance, design, and implement this 1320 MW imported coal based power project. CPIH has a 74% ownership stake and HUBCO has a 26% ownership stake in CPHGC. CPHGC was granted a generation license by Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) on September 8, 2016. The term of the license is 30 years from the date of the commencement of commercial operations. CPHGC also submitted an application for an upfront tariff determination with NEPRA, which was approved on February 12, 2016. Then, on January 25, 2017, the Implementation Agreement (IA) and Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) were signed.   The purpose of the project is to construct 2×660 MW coal fired units and a dedicated jetty terminal to import coal at Hub, Mouza Kund, Tehsil Gadani, Lasbela District, and Balochistan Province. Northwest Electric Power Design Institute Co. Ltd. (NWEPDI) and Tianjin Electric Power Construction Company Limited are the EPC contractors responsible for project design and implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on March 21, 2017, and on April 10, 2018, CPHGC entered into Operation and Maintenance (O&M) contract with a consortium that consists of CEEC Tianjin (Pakistan) Electric Power Construction (Private) Limited, China Energy Engineering Group, Tianjin Electric Power Construction Company Limited, and China Energy Engineering Group Science and Technology Development Company Limited to provide operation and maintenance service for the coal-fired electric power generation plant. The project reached its commercial operation date (COD) on August 17, 2019. Its originally expected commercial operation date was August 31, 2018. It is expected that this power plant will provide 9 billion kWh electricity to Pakistan’s national grid each year, thereby meeting the electricity needs of 4 million Pakistani households.   However, this project has encountered a number of revenue generation, debt repayment, and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. The Government of Pakistan fell behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to CPHGC. Total payment arrears, as of May 2022, amounted to PKR 71.6 billion (approximately $379,480,000), which reportedly brought the power plant to the brink of closure and CPHGC to the brink of default. It also became more difficult for CPHGC to source the coal needed to power the plant (due to the inability of a supplier to provide coal from Afghanistan and skyrocketing international coal prices). Then, in July 2022, CPHGC) revealed that the country’s central bank — the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) — had stopped making various payments relating to coal suppliers due to the limited availability of foreign exchange in the country, which resulted in a major accumulation of payment arrears. In a letter dated July 20, 2022, the CEO of CPHGC, Ren Lihui, wrote to Pakistan’s Secretary of Power and warned that ‘any further delay in […] payments [from the State Bank of Pakistan] can adversely affect the ability of CPHGC to operate smoothly.’ He also warned that ‘If the Government of Pakistan fails to fulfill its responsibilities or does not respond in a timely manner, any loss, damages or [liquidated damages] should be borne by the Government of Pakistan.’   Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this “[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Then, in March 2023, CPHGC warned that it was at risk of defaulting on its loan repayment obligations due to overdue power purchase payments from the Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guaranteed (CPPA-G).","1.

It also became more difficult for CPHGC to source the coal needed to power the plant (due to the inability of a supplier to provide coal from Afghanistan and skyrocketing international coal prices). Then, in July 2022, CPHGC) revealed that the country’s central bank — the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) — had stopped making various payments relating to coal suppliers due to the limited availability of foreign exchange in the country, which resulted in a major accumulation of payment arrears. In a letter dated July 20, 2022, the CEO of CPHGC, Ren Lihui, wrote to Pakistan’s Secretary of Power and warned that ‘any further delay in […] payments [from the State Bank of Pakistan] can adversely affect the ability of CPHGC to operate smoothly.’ He also warned that ‘If the Government of Pakistan fails to fulfill its responsibilities or does not respond in a timely manner, any loss, damages or [liquidated damages] should be borne by the Government of Pakistan.’   Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this “[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Then, in March 2023, CPHGC warned that it was at risk of defaulting on its loan repayment obligations due to overdue power purchase payments from the Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guaranteed (CPPA-G).",TRUE,NA,BROWN,HIGH,Coal Power,"Primary purpose is coal-fired power generation, which is environmentally harmful and inhibits energy transition","2×660MW coal-fired units, imported coal-based power project, dedicated jetty terminal for coal imports"

(and its subsidiary in Hong Kong) and Shandong Ruyi Technology Group Co., Ltd. (and its subsidiary in Hong Kong) was granted a Letter of Intention (LOI) by the Government of Pakistan, thereby officially obtaining the right to develop the Sahiwal 2 x 660 MW Coal-Fired Power Plant Project. One day later, on May 22, 2014, Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. — a special purpose vehicle (project company) and joint venture of Huaneng Shandong Power Generation Co. Ltd. (51% ownership stake) and Shandong Ruyi Science & Technology Group (49% ownership stake) — was officially incorporated and established to assume responsibility for the development, investment, and management the two 660 MW coal-fired units in Sahiwal.  By July 23, 2014, a senior management team was in place at Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. In November 2014, a project feasibility study report was approved after an assessment was made by experts from the Electric Power Planning & Engineering Institute (EPPEI) and the Government of Punjab. On November 21, 2014, SEPCO1 Electric Power Construction Corporation was selected as the EPC contractor through bidding.  Then, in February 2017, four Chinese state-owned commercial banks — the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Bank of China (BOC), China Construction Bank (CCB), and Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) — signed a $1.44 billion syndicated buyer’s credit (facility) agreement with Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. for the Sahiwal 2 x 660 MW Coal-Fired Power Plant Project. The estimated borrowing terms of the buyer’s credit are as follows: a 14-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, an all-in 4.95% interest rate (6-month LIBOR plus a 4.5% margin), and a 5.26% Sinosure insurance premium. The Government of Pakistan also issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan and granted a 27.2% guaranteed return on equity to the project sponsors (investors).  ICBC's contribution is captured via Project ID#52659. BOC's contribution is captured via Project ID#92302. CCB's contribution is captured via Project ID#92303. ABC's contribution is captured via Project ID#92304.  The total cost of the Sahiwal 2 x 660 MW Coal-Fired Power Plant Project was $1.808 billion. It was implemented as an Independent Power Project (IPP) — as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) Initiative — and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25. Project ID #52659 captures the debt financing component and Project ID#54134 captures the equity financing component.  The purpose of the project was to construct 1320 MW coal-fired power plant — with two 660 MW supercritical coal-fired units (Unit 1 and Unit 2) — with synchronous installation of high-efficiency electrostatic precipitator and flue gas desulfurization facilities. The project site is located about 12 miles from Sahiwal and 9.3 miles from Okara cantonment, just north of the road which connects the two towns, in Pakistan's Punjab Province. Its exact locational coordinates are 30°42′55″N 73°14′20″E. The 690 hectare project site was given to the Chinese side by the Pakistani government free of charge. PowerChina Nuclear Engineering Company and SEPCO1 Electric Power Construction Corporation (a subsidiary of PowerChina) were the general EPC contractors responsible for implementation.  A groundbreaking ceremony was held on May 30, 2014. Foundation soil replacement and pile foundation tests commenced on February 6, 2015. Construction began on July 31, 2015. Unit 1 passed a 168-hour full-load trial operation and was put into operation on May 24. 2017. Unit 2 passed a 168-hour full-load trial operation and was put into operation on June 8. 2017. All network-related tests were completed on October 12, 2017. The project achieved its Commercial Operations Date (COD) and the power plant was connected to the national grid on October 28, 2017. As part of a build, operate, transfer (BOT) agreement, the power plant's ownership is to be transferred from the project company to the Government of Punjab after 30 years of operation.  However, this project has encountered a number of revenue generation, debt repayment, and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. In April 2018, reports emerged that the Government of Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 20 billion (approximately $172 million), which reportedly brought the Sahiwal 2 x 660 MW Coal-Fired Power Plant Project to ‘to the brink of closure’. It also made it more difficult for Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. to source the coal needed to power the plant (since Pakistan Railway demands advance payment for coal transportation). Then, in a letter dated August 7, 2022, Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. acknowledged that more than 0.5 million tons of South African coal were being stored in Port Qasim and awaiting clearance because it was unable to pay the coal supplier.

Then, in September 2017, the Power Division forwarded a draft Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) to be signed between Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guaranteed (CPPA-G) and power producer(s) to the Finance Division. CPPA-G subsequently executed the finalized draft of RAA with multiple CPEC IPPs. The Government of Pakistan also guaranteed the funding obligations of the CPPA with respect to the RAA, through Supplemental Implementation Agreements signed between the Government of Pakistan — through the Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) — and the respective IPPs.7.
