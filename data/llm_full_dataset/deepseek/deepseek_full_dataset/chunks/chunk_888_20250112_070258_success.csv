Chinese Government provides $24.59 million USD grant for 29 MW Solar Power Project (linked to #69158)

# Description
On March 2, 2015, the Chinese and Cuban governments signed an Exchange of Letters for the implementation of solar power station projects. Cuba's Ministry of Energy and Mines planned to install photovoltaic facilities, capable of 29 MW in total, on five Cuban solar farms through a $24,590,000 USD grant and $22,950,000 USD soft loan, both provided by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM). The loan element to this project is captured in linked project #69158.  The project management unit is China Qiyuan Engineering Design and Research Institute Co., Ltd., and the project general contractor is China Hydropower Engineering Consulting Group Company.  The first stage of this project involved the construction of two photovoltaic plants with a combined capacity of 9 MW.  The pair includes a 4 MW solar farm in the Pinar del Rio province and a 5-MW plant in Cienfuegos province, the latter being the largest facility of its kind in Cuba.  Construction of the power plants began on 18 November, 2016 and was completed and successfully passed technical acceptance on 12 April, 2018.  On 26 April 2018, the ceremony for the completion and handover of the photovoltaic power plants was held at the site of the 5MW project in Yagualama Town, Enfugos Province, Cuba. Solar parks will continue to be constructed in the Cienfuegos province until 2030. China will provide the technology while Cuba will take care of the physical construction.",TRUE,NA,GREEN,HIGH,Solar Power,Primary purpose is solar power generation through photovoltaic facilities,"29 MW solar power project, photovoltaic facilities, solar farms, renewable energy focus"

The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown.  The purpose of the project was to construct the 20 MW Jesus Rabi biomass power plant in the Matanzas province, north of the Jesus Rabi sugar plant.  The plant was expected to supply power to the daily production at the sugar plant, supply heat to the del Bardo brewery, and will sell the remaining power to national power alliances.  The project was initially discussed in June 2013, and construction was expected to begin by the end of that year; however, there appeared to be some difficulty in acquiring the promised $60 million from China Eximbank until 2015.  Shandong Electric Power Engineering Consulting Institute Corp., Ltd. (SDEPCI) was the contractor responsible for project implementation.  It signed an EPC contract with AZCUBA (Cuba's state-run sugar monopoly).  The project entered implementation in March 2018.  As of July 7, 2020, the construction of the 20MW Jesus Rabi Biomass Power Plant Project was still ongoing.",1.  The Chinese project title is 古巴郝苏斯拉比20MW生物质发电项目. 2.
