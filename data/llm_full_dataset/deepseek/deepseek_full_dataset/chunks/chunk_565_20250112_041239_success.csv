It is the most extensive river system in the Cordillera region of Luzon, the largest and most populous island in the Philippines. In the 1970s, the river rose to prominence in the Philippines national consciousness as a symbol of the struggles of indigenous peoples (IPs), notably the Kalinga and Bontoc tribes, regarding a proposed project to construct a dam on the river and its effect on their ancestral domains.   During the Marcos administration, the Chico River was eyed as the location of a proposed electric power generation facility popularly known as the Chico River Dam Project. The project was conceived in 1965 as the Chico River Basin Development Project. Still, it was not until the 1973 oil crisis that the government set plans in motion. In 1974, it became known that indigenous people, who had not been consulted or informed about project plans, would be affected. Reports indicated that even if only one out of the four proposed dams were implemented, more than a thousand families would be displaced and rendered homeless, several barrios would be submerged, farmlands would be lost, and other areas flooded. The affected communities rejected the various financial relocation settlement packages offered by the Marcos government because of “the significance of the lands to their religious beliefs and to the legal system which shaped the relationship of their tribes and communities to one another.”   Having secured a grant from the World Bank, the government was eager to proceed with the project. However, opposition was mounting from the indigenous people, who organized with the help of various non-governmental organizations. In response, President Marcos issued Presidential Decree No. 848 in 1975, creating a Kalinga Special Development Region (KSDR) to neutralize the opposition. With martial law still in place, it became easy to militarize the project areas and suppress opposition to the project. This resulted in several opposition leaders being rounded up. The conflict came to a head when Macli-ing Dulag, the official spokesperson of the organized opposition to the project, was murdered in his home by the military. With the outcry stemming from Dulag’s death, the World Bank and President Marcos shelved the project. The Chico River Dam Project has since been a symbol of the indigenous peoples’ struggles to protect their ancestral lands and their way of living.   In 2016, the Chico River was once again catapulted to prominence with the announcement of the Chico River Pump Irrigation Project (CRPIP) as the first flagship project of the Duterte Administration’s “Build, Build, Build” (BBB) program, financed by the Chinese Government. For the affected communities, the project revived the bitter memories of the Marcos-era Chico River Dam Project.   On October 20, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Philippines signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on financing cooperation. Then, on November 15, 2017, the two parties signed a financing cooperation agreement on the Chico River Pump Irrigation Project (CRPIP). The Government of Philippines’ National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) approved the project on December 5, 2018. Approximately five months later, on September 21, 2018, the Government of Philippines submitted a loan application to China Eximbank.   Then, on April 9, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of the Philippines signed a USD 62,086,837.82 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [No. 1420103052018210863 CHINA EXIMBANK PBC 2018 NO. 11 TOTAL NO. 468] for the Chico River Pump Irrigation Project (CRPIP). The Monetary Board of the Bangko Sentral approved the PBC agreement on May 17, 2018. The borrowing terms of the PBC are as follows: a 20-year maturity period, a 7-year grace period, an interest rate of 2%, a default (penalty) interest rate of 0%, a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee ($186,260.51). The loan effectiveness date was on June 5, 2018.   The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a PHP 3,688,688,600 commercial (EPC) contract [ID#CRPIP-ICB-C-1] between the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) and China CAMC Engineering Co., which was signed on March 8, 2018.  The purpose of the project is to provide a stable supply of water to around 8,700 hectares of agricultural land through the construction of new diversion and canal systems, increasing agricultural productivity and benefiting some 4,300 farmers in 21 barangays (districts) in the municipalities of Tuao and Piat in Cagayan Province and Pinukpuk in Kalinga Province. The project involves the construction of a pump house (located at the right bank facing downstream of the Chico River), sub-station, transmission line, diversion main canal, lateral canals, appurtenant structures, service/access road, and terminal facilities. The project also reportedly aims to contribute some 36,000 metric tons of milled rice to the country’s rice supply, generate about $16 million in savings from rice imports. and yield an incremental income of about P75,000 per hectare per year.   China CAMC Engineering Co. is the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation.  On June 8, 2018, a groundbreaking ceremony took place. The project was originally expected to reach completion within three years (June 8, 2021). However, it has encountered various problems and implementation delays.   In 2018, the Cordillera Peoples Alliance (CPA), founded in 1984 as an independent federation of progressive people’s organizations in the Cordillera Region, expressed concerns about the project, saying: “Under the guise of advancing socio-economic agenda, the hand of foreign investors in the implementation of this project will result in the privatization of agricultural services and will force us to succumb to unfair conditions set by these corporations in exchange to access to our very own resources. This is one of the regime’s means to fast-track the entry of foreign corporations to make profit from our deprivation while exploiting our natural resources.” The CPA further contends that the CRPIP is not sustainable under the overall development plan for the Chico River and has no assurance that the project will work, especially in the long run. They are concerned that the CRPIP will deprive downstream communities of water supply and further aggravate the scarcity of water on the Chico River during the summer. The CRPIP comes with significant potential social costs, similar to those of the Chico River Dam Project. The Chico River and any project that involves it will always be tainted with the memory of the struggles of the indigenous people against the Marcos-era project. The social unrest that was created by the staged consultation process during the Marcos martial law years seems to be happening again. There is also a threat that the project will lead to environmental degradation, including widespread flooding, and consequently contribute to disturbing the rich biodiversity in the area. According to La Viña and Reyes, the CRPIP is “development aggression at its worst,” considering that it is “bad for nature and our people and will result in social conflict and fuel an already intensifying insurgency in both the Sierra Madre and the Cordillera.” Additionally, major governance issues—from a defective consultation process to a gross disregard for existing regulatory processes—have dogged the project.   In view of these issues, a group of legislators from the House of Representatives known as the Makabayan (Patriotic Coalition of the People) bloc filed a petition before the Supreme Court on April 4, 2019, asking it to stop the loan agreement with China Eximbank.   Reminiscent of the protests against the Chico River Dam Project during the Marcos years, the CRPIP has also experienced challenges from the local communities, leading to the “No to Karayan Movement.” According to Frank Cimatu, reporting for Rappler, the “Naneng, Dallak, and Minanga tribes have written a letter to the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) in the region about this project” and the parties invited to the consultations are those who would not be affected by the party. Republic Act No. 8371, also called the Indigenous Peoples’ Rights Act of 1997 (IPRA), recognizes the right of indigenous cultural communities (ICCs) and indigenous peoples to self-determination. The law also provides mechanisms for the protection of their ancestral domains and the resources present therein. One of the means to achieve this is through the concept of free and prior informed consent (FPIC), defined as the “consensus of all members of the ICCs/IPs to be determined in accordance with their respective customary laws and practices, free from any external manipulation, interference and coercion, and obtained after fully disclosing the intent and scope of the activity, in a language and process understandable to the community.” Moreover, a certification pre-condition (CP) is necessary before a project can proceed, as stated in the law.   Official sources indicate that groundbreaking ceremonies for the project were held in Pinukpuk, Kalinga, as early as June 8, 2018. A groundbreaking event held in Barangay Pinococ in Pinukpuk, province of Kalinga, was documented, and a photo of it was posted on the official NIA-CAR website. However, it was not until May 23, 2019 that the CP was issued by NCIP en banc, according to NCIP Cordillera Director Roland Calde.  While no official groundbreaking date was obtained, a statement from Roland Calde, Regional Director of the NCIP Cordillera, confirmed that construction began before the issuance of the CP, noting “the project had already commenced even before they could receive the report.” In fact, in a meeting on May 7, 2019, in response to the situation, the NCIP, NIA-Cagayan Valley, the Regional Development Council, and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources agreed to suspend project activities while the CP was processed. Eventually, construction resumed after the necessary documents were completed.   Aside from the failure by the government to observe the requirement of having a CP before the implementation of the project, Frank Cimatu also noted the following issues concerning FPIC: (a) According to the Cordillera People’s Alliance and other IPs, the FPICs of the communities where the project is located (in Katabbogan and Pinococ in Pinukpuk, Kalinga) were not obtained; (b) There is a lack of full disclosure of information about the project prior to the supposed consultations for the FPIC, such as the provisions of the loan agreement, including the Chinese contractor and Chinese workers that will implement the project; and (c) In lieu of true FPIC, the consent came in the form of the Individual Right of Way Permit to Enter and Construct, signed by the individual landowners and NIA. These documents became the go-signal to begin construction.   With construction in full swing, these issues appear to have been legally settled. However, it is not clear whether the genuine concerns have been resolved to the satisfaction of the indigenous peoples in the affected communities. As of March 2019, the CRPIP had achieved a physical completion rate of 22.37%.  Then, after a June 25, 2019 site inspection, Administrator General Ricardo Visaya reported that the project was running ahead of schedule. As of December 2021, the project had achieved an 82.88% completion rate and it was still running ahead of schedule.","1. This project is also known as the CRPIP.

63942,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides $211.2 million preferential buyer's credit for New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project,"On October 20, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Philippines signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on financing cooperation. Then, on November 15, 2017, the two parties signed a financing cooperation agreement on the New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project. The Government of Philippines’ National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Investment Coordination Committee approved the project on April 25, 2018. Approximately five months later, on September 21, 2018, the Government of Philippines submitted a loan application to China Eximbank.   Then, on November 20, 2018, China Eximbank and the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) — a government agency in the Philippines that is in charge of water privatization in Metro Manila — signed a $211,214,646.54 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [No.I420I0300202018213220 and CHINA EXIMBANK PBC 2018 NO.25 TOTAL NO.48] for the New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC are as follows: a 20-year maturity period, a 7-year grace period, an interest rate of 2%, a default (penalty) interest rate of 0%, a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee ($633,643.94). The loan effectiveness date was on November 1, 2019, and MWSS paid the entire management fee ($633,643.94) to China Eximbank on November 26, 2019. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a PHP 12,189,893,798.70 commercial (EPC) contract [No.NCWS-KDP 001-2018] between MWSS and China Energy Engineering Corporation Limited (CEEC).   The purpose of the project is to construct the Kaliwa Dam, including intake facilities and other facilities, and a 57 million cubic meter reservoir. The project involves the construction of a water conveyance tunnel that is expected to supply 2,400 million liters per day of raw water for Metro Manila, thereby reducing dependence on the Angat Dam reservoir. Upon completion, the project is also expected to benefit some 17.46 million people or about 3.49 million households of Metro Manila, Rizal, and Quezon. The Kaliwa dam is located in the municipalities of General Nakar and Infanta in Quezon Province and the municipality of Teresa in Rizal Province.   CEEC is the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. EDCOP, PRIMEX, and SMEC are also involved in the project as subcontractors. An environmental compliance certificate (ECC) [No. ECC-CO-1907-0017] for the project was issued by the Government of the Philippines’ Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) on October 11, 2019. But DENR Undersecretary Benny Antiporda was quoted as saying that “the ECC was issued because it was a priority project of the government and the agency had no recourse but to approve it.” A notice to proceed was issued to the EPC contractor on November 13, 2019.   By May 2020, there were only a few more kilometers of access road (to the planned reservoir in General Nakar town in Quezon) left to construct to reach the main dam site. As of December 31, 2020, the project had achieved a 2.48% completion rate. As of March 2021, it had achieved a 9.44% completion rate. Then, on June 29, 2021, a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place.    A June 2021 report quoted MWSS as saying that tunnel excavation for the Kaliwa Dam would be ready to begin in December 2021, with the planned arrival of the tunnel boring machine to the Port of Manila slated for July 2021. Construction continued throughout 2021, despite the fact that the project did not have permits from the appropriate government agencies, opened up the possibility that the ECC issued for the project would be revoked. According to the Commission on Audit (COA), MWSS and CEEC must first comply with the requirements of the National Integrated Protected Areas Systems Act and have a certification issued by the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples. It must also identify disposal sites of excavated materials, among others. If these requirements are not met, the COA has warned that the ECC may be cancelled, which would jeopardize the loan agreement with China Eximbank and the commercial contract with CEEC. The project has generated a great deal of local criticism, with some people warning that the dam could destroy the ecosystems and habitats of indigenous people in several Quezon province towns.   After granting the project’s ECC, the Government of the Philippines downplayed the threat of a sizable flood occurring in the case of structural damage to the dam caused by an earthquake. Public officials claimed that there are no active faults near the dam. The New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project also threatens to displace up to 10,000 members of the Dumagat-Remontado indigenous people group who live in the project area. These Dumagat communities depend on farming for a majority of their income as well as working for Sierra Madre hikers. The loss of their farmland leaves their economic future uncertain. The project site is also the location of sites sacred to the Dumagat people. The Government of the Philippines claims that only 46 families stand to be affected by the project.   In March 2019, Marcelino Tena, President of Samahan ng mga Katutubong Agta-Dumagat-Remontado na Binabaka at Ipinagtatanggol ang Lupaing Ninuno (SAGIBIN-LN), alleged that MWSS “did not follow the right process to secure the Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC),” adding that the engineering design had not been shown to them. In contrast, then-MWSS administrator Reynaldo Velasco claimed that only about 46 families would be affected, that several consultations with those who would be affected had been made, and that the project design had yet to be finalized. The controversy led to the creation of the “STOP Kaliwa Dam” (SKD) organization. Also known as Sectors and Peoples Totally Opposed to Kaliwa Dam, the organization claims representation from indigenous peoples, local communities, church leaders, academics, environmentalists, and social movements. The group has started a signature campaign from all over the Philippines to petition Duterte to stop the project.   By September 2019, the official MWSS website reported that three successful public hearings initiated by DENR-EMB and the MWSS had been conducted, as follows: at General Nakar, Quezon on August 23, 2019, at Teresa, Rizal on August 27, 2019; and at Infanta, Quezon on August 28, 2019. In connection with the free, prior, and informed consent, the site has this to say: “With regard to MWSS’ compliance with Republic Act No. 8173 or the Indigenous People’s Rights Acts, the MWSS through the National Commission of Indigenous Peoples has successfully completed the community assemblies on the six (6) clusters of IP communities in Quezon Province as part of the Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) process (emphasis supplied).” However, according to Mavic Conde, five out of six cluster communities in General Nakar—one of the two municipalities in Quezon province where the NCWS-KDP will be located (the other one is Infanta)— voted overwhelmingly no, effectively rejecting the project. The five clusters consist of those in Lumutan, Baybay, Pasanghan, Umiray, and Cablao.   Also, Aaron Pedrosa, attorney for the progressive political party Sanlakas, alleged that MWSS failed to provide proof of compliance with the procedural requirement of posting a public notice and a copy of the scoping report as proof that public scoping was conducted in the area as part of the environmental impact study. These allegations and counter-allegations have given rise to serious legal questions relating to the issuance of the ECC in the absence of a valid consultation process.","1.

AidData relies upon the loan commitment year and face value of the loan that is reported in the loan agreement itself.  5. NEDA’s assessment of the project in 2013 found that the standalone Kaliwa Dam would be barely viable based on its estimated economic internal rate of return (and that the integrated Laiban and Kaliwa Dam system would not be viable without water treatment plants). On the other hand, a 2012 World Bank assessment, which considered probable leakage rates as well as environmental assessment and watershed maintenance costs, singled out the Kaliwa Dam project as offering the lowest financial internal rate of return out of ten potential Metro Manila water projects. A 2021 scholarly assessment of the economic viability of the dam suggest it may become a “white elephant” project, economically burdensome to the host country. 6. The New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project (NCWS-KDP) has been on and off the government’s major infrastructure list since the 1970s. Its development stalled primarily because of environmental and socio-cultural issues relating to the planned construction. The project was first conceptualized under then-President Ferdinand Marcos but was overtaken by events with his departure in February 1986. However, the MWSS Board of Trustees decided to temporarily defer the Laiban Dam Project in December 1989 to accommodate equally important water supply projects which were determined to be urgent at that time. Technical studies about the construction of a dam in Laiban continued under the administration of President Fidel Ramos starting in 1992.  By 2007, the administration of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo had secured a loan from China to fund the project. However, a political scandal involving a Chinese firm marred the administration and caused the project to be shelved. In 2009, San Miguel Corporation, a private company, submitted an unsolicited proposal for the construction of a massive Laiban Dam with a correspondingly large reservoir slated to flood some 28,000 hectares of forest. The proposal was eventually set aside with growing public concerns that the project would increase water rates and displace indigenous people; MWSS subsequently terminated the joint-venture talks for the project.  Some years later, the project was resuscitated as the New Centennial Water Source project (NCWS) with a proposal for two dams in the Kaliwa watershed: a main Laiban Dam and a regulating Kaliwa Low Dam. Concerns about the duration and construction costs led officials to consider building them in stages under different financial schemes. Choosing this option, NEDA approved the implementation of the Kaliwa Low Dam as the first stage in 2014.  Discussions about the Kaliwa Dam resurfaced in March 2019 when parts of Metro Manila experienced significant water service interruptions lasting up to 19 hours per day.7. The Kaliwa River watershed is part of the Sierra Madre Biodiversity Corridor (SMBC). The dam is to be built within the Kaliwa River area declared as a forest reserve under Proclamation No. 573 issued in 1969. Furthermore, Proclamation No. 1636 issued in 1977 demarcated other areas to be affected by the construction as a national park, wildlife sanctuary, and a game preserve. The project’s location in protected and ecological important areas is the main driver of concerns about its impact on biodiversity.  According to the 2018 report of the Haribon Foundation—an organization founded in 1972 committed to “nature conservation through community empowerment and scientific excellence”— the construction of the multi-billion-peso Kaliwa Dam Project will not only have devastating effects on people’s lives, but it will also ravage the homes of thousands of threatened wildlife species in the Sierra Madre mountain forests. The same report states that the dam area declared as a wildlife sanctuary is a “key habitat to 15 species of amphibians, 334 bird species, 1476 fish species, 963 invertebrate species, 81 mammal species, 50 plant species, and 60 reptile species,” according to the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool curated by BirdLife International, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and the United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre. Of the species, a significant number are considered globally threatened by the IUCN, including the critically-endangered Philippine Eagle and the Hawksbill Turtle.8.

# Title
China Eximbank provides $211.2 million preferential buyer's credit for New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project

# Description
On October 20, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Philippines signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on financing cooperation. Then, on November 15, 2017, the two parties signed a financing cooperation agreement on the New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project. The Government of Philippines’ National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Investment Coordination Committee approved the project on April 25, 2018. Approximately five months later, on September 21, 2018, the Government of Philippines submitted a loan application to China Eximbank.   Then, on November 20, 2018, China Eximbank and the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) — a government agency in the Philippines that is in charge of water privatization in Metro Manila — signed a $211,214,646.54 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [No.I420I0300202018213220 and CHINA EXIMBANK PBC 2018 NO.25 TOTAL NO.48] for the New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC are as follows: a 20-year maturity period, a 7-year grace period, an interest rate of 2%, a default (penalty) interest rate of 0%, a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee ($633,643.94). The loan effectiveness date was on November 1, 2019, and MWSS paid the entire management fee ($633,643.94) to China Eximbank on November 26, 2019. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a PHP 12,189,893,798.70 commercial (EPC) contract [No.NCWS-KDP 001-2018] between MWSS and China Energy Engineering Corporation Limited (CEEC).   The purpose of the project is to construct the Kaliwa Dam, including intake facilities and other facilities, and a 57 million cubic meter reservoir. The project involves the construction of a water conveyance tunnel that is expected to supply 2,400 million liters per day of raw water for Metro Manila, thereby reducing dependence on the Angat Dam reservoir. Upon completion, the project is also expected to benefit some 17.46 million people or about 3.49 million households of Metro Manila, Rizal, and Quezon. The Kaliwa dam is located in the municipalities of General Nakar and Infanta in Quezon Province and the municipality of Teresa in Rizal Province.   CEEC is the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. EDCOP, PRIMEX, and SMEC are also involved in the project as subcontractors. An environmental compliance certificate (ECC) [No. ECC-CO-1907-0017] for the project was issued by the Government of the Philippines’ Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) on October 11, 2019. But DENR Undersecretary Benny Antiporda was quoted as saying that “the ECC was issued because it was a priority project of the government and the agency had no recourse but to approve it.” A notice to proceed was issued to the EPC contractor on November 13, 2019.   By May 2020, there were only a few more kilometers of access road (to the planned reservoir in General Nakar town in Quezon) left to construct to reach the main dam site. As of December 31, 2020, the project had achieved a 2.48% completion rate. As of March 2021, it had achieved a 9.44% completion rate. Then, on June 29, 2021, a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place.    A June 2021 report quoted MWSS as saying that tunnel excavation for the Kaliwa Dam would be ready to begin in December 2021, with the planned arrival of the tunnel boring machine to the Port of Manila slated for July 2021. Construction continued throughout 2021, despite the fact that the project did not have permits from the appropriate government agencies, opened up the possibility that the ECC issued for the project would be revoked. According to the Commission on Audit (COA), MWSS and CEEC must first comply with the requirements of the National Integrated Protected Areas Systems Act and have a certification issued by the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples. It must also identify disposal sites of excavated materials, among others. If these requirements are not met, the COA has warned that the ECC may be cancelled, which would jeopardize the loan agreement with China Eximbank and the commercial contract with CEEC. The project has generated a great deal of local criticism, with some people warning that the dam could destroy the ecosystems and habitats of indigenous people in several Quezon province towns.   After granting the project’s ECC, the Government of the Philippines downplayed the threat of a sizable flood occurring in the case of structural damage to the dam caused by an earthquake. Public officials claimed that there are no active faults near the dam. The New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project also threatens to displace up to 10,000 members of the Dumagat-Remontado indigenous people group who live in the project area. These Dumagat communities depend on farming for a majority of their income as well as working for Sierra Madre hikers. The loss of their farmland leaves their economic future uncertain. The project site is also the location of sites sacred to the Dumagat people. The Government of the Philippines claims that only 46 families stand to be affected by the project.   In March 2019, Marcelino Tena, President of Samahan ng mga Katutubong Agta-Dumagat-Remontado na Binabaka at Ipinagtatanggol ang Lupaing Ninuno (SAGIBIN-LN), alleged that MWSS “did not follow the right process to secure the Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC),” adding that the engineering design had not been shown to them. In contrast, then-MWSS administrator Reynaldo Velasco claimed that only about 46 families would be affected, that several consultations with those who would be affected had been made, and that the project design had yet to be finalized. The controversy led to the creation of the “STOP Kaliwa Dam” (SKD) organization. Also known as Sectors and Peoples Totally Opposed to Kaliwa Dam, the organization claims representation from indigenous peoples, local communities, church leaders, academics, environmentalists, and social movements. The group has started a signature campaign from all over the Philippines to petition Duterte to stop the project.   By September 2019, the official MWSS website reported that three successful public hearings initiated by DENR-EMB and the MWSS had been conducted, as follows: at General Nakar, Quezon on August 23, 2019, at Teresa, Rizal on August 27, 2019; and at Infanta, Quezon on August 28, 2019. In connection with the free, prior, and informed consent, the site has this to say: “With regard to MWSS’ compliance with Republic Act No. 8173 or the Indigenous People’s Rights Acts, the MWSS through the National Commission of Indigenous Peoples has successfully completed the community assemblies on the six (6) clusters of IP communities in Quezon Province as part of the Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) process (emphasis supplied).” However, according to Mavic Conde, five out of six cluster communities in General Nakar—one of the two municipalities in Quezon province where the NCWS-KDP will be located (the other one is Infanta)— voted overwhelmingly no, effectively rejecting the project. The five clusters consist of those in Lumutan, Baybay, Pasanghan, Umiray, and Cablao.   Also, Aaron Pedrosa, attorney for the progressive political party Sanlakas, alleged that MWSS failed to provide proof of compliance with the procedural requirement of posting a public notice and a copy of the scoping report as proof that public scoping was conducted in the area as part of the environmental impact study. These allegations and counter-allegations have given rise to serious legal questions relating to the issuance of the ECC in the absence of a valid consultation process.",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,General Infrastructure,"The project primarily involves the construction of a dam and water conveyance system for water supply, which is not directly related to energy production or transition","Construction of Kaliwa Dam, water conveyance tunnel, and reservoir for water supply to Metro Manila"

The new, 506.46 meter bridge was to be built with a pre-stressed concrete rigid frame with corrugated steel webs and four-lane concrete deck slab. It was designed to connect Estrella Street in Makati to Barangka Drive in Mandaluyong City. The previous bridge had two lanes and will be expanded to four lanes, accommodating, with about 9,438 vehicles per day expected to be diverted from the adjacent bridges (Makati-Mandaluyong Bridge and Guadalupe Bridge).   The purpose of the Binondo-Intramuros Bridge Construction Project (see Project ID #64983) is to construct the Binondo-Intramuros Bridge crossing the Pasig River in Manila. This bridge was financed with approximately USD 74.15 million of Chinese Government grant funding and involves the construction of a steel arch bridge (basket type) supporting a 4-lane deck of approximately 734 meters to connect the Intramuros side at Solana Street and Riverside Drive and the Binondo side at San Fernando Street with a viaduct over the creek to Muelle del Binondo. The total length of the route is 734 meters, and the length of the main line bridge is 627 meters.   The National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) board approved both projects on September 12, 2017. China Road and Bridge Engineering Co., Ltd.  is the contractor responsible for the implementation of both projects and CCCC Highways Consultants Co. Ltd. is the contractor responsible for the design of both projects.  On April 27, 2018, a signing ceremony was held in Manila in which China Road and Bridge Engineering Co., Ltd. signed a construction contract and CCCC Highways Consultants Co. Ltd. signed a design contract. A formal groundbreaking ceremony for both projects took place on July 17, 2018. However, construction reportedly did not begin until January 19, 2019.   The Estrella-Pantaleon Bridge Expansion and Reconstruction Project was originally expected to reach completion by May 2020, but its expected completion date was subsequently pushed back to February 2021. As of March 2021, the project had achieved an 81.6% completion rate. On July 29, 2021, the bridge was opened and motorists began using it the following day.   The Binondo-Intramuros Bridge Construction Project was originally expected to reach completion in 2020, but its expected completion date was later pushed back to February 1, 2021. In March 2019, conservation groups raised concerns regarding the Binondo-Intramuro bridge's proximity to a UNESCO World Heritage Site, San Agustin Church and Monastery, and construction was officially halted in May 2019 for the Philippines Department of Public Works and Highways to ""to submit technical studies on potential archeological and cultural risks of construction.”  By February 2021, the project had achieved a 50% completion rate. By July 2021, it had had reached a 70% completion rate. By September 2021, it had reached a 77% completion rate, and the main structure of the bridge was almost complete.",1. This project is also known as the Two China Aid Bridges Project: Estrella-Pantaleon Bridge and Binondo-Intramuros Bridge. The Chinese project title is 援马尼拉桥梁项目 or 马尼拉桥梁项目. 2.
