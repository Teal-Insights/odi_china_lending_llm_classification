The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a May 4, 2014 commercial contract [EXMB/KG/NS-05] worth $298,796,966.13 between the Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic and China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC). According to internal data that the Kyrgyz Ministry of Finance shared with AidData in July 2022, this loan achieved a disbursement rate of 83.8% ($155,374,422.40 out of $185,254,119) as of December 31, 2021 and its amount outstanding was $155,374,422.40 as of December 31, 2021.   The purpose of the project was to construct a section of the Alternative North-South Road that runs from Aral to Kazarman (195 km to 291 km).  The aim of this international North-South transport corridor is to reduce trade costs and connect Russia, Central Asia, Iran, and India.  CRBC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on August 10, 2015. However, as of December 2020, the project had still only achieved a 70% completion rate.

According to a 2018 investigation, former Minister of Transport and Communications Kalykbek Sultanov and the Minister of Transport and Communications at the time (Zhamshitbek Kalilov) may have colluded with the contractor responsible for project implementation (CRBC) to embezzle funds that were allocated for the Alternative North-South Road by China Eximbank. The investigation found the project input costs were inflated by several orders of magnitude — from paying $1.1 per kilogram of cement (while the cost on the local market was $0.07) to paying $2,000 a month to provide office space to an engineer on the construction site.","1.

The China Eximbank loan that supported this project is not included in the Overseas Development Finance Dataset that Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center published in December 2020. 4. The borrower of the loan is not explicitly identified in any of the underlying sources that underpin this project record. However, EDL-Generation Company Limited (EDL-Gen) — a subsidiary of Électricité du Laos (EDL) — is identified as the project owner, so AidData assumes that the Government of Laos (or an entity owned by the Government of Laos) is the borrower. 5. Électricité du Laos (EDL) is the state corporation of Laos that owns and operates the country's electricity generation, electricity transmission and electricity distribution assets. The company also manages the import and export of electricity from the national electricity grid of the country. EDL-Generation Company Limited (EDL-Gen) was incorporated in 2010 and operates as a subsidiary of EDL.6.  The face value of the loan is unknown. For the time being, AidData assumes that the loan was provided in the form of a buyer's credit and it financed 85% of the $177.07 million commercial (EPC) contract cost. This issue warrants further investigation.","# Sector

# Title
China Eximbank provides loan for 80MW Nam Ngum 1 Hydropower Expansion Project (Units 7 & 8)

# Description
In 2015, China Eximbank issued a loan to the Government of Laos for the 80MW Nam Ngum 1 Hydropower Expansion Project (Units 7 & 8). The face value and borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance a $177.07 million engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract that Dongfang Electric Group (DEC) and Electricite du Laos (EDL) signed in 2013.   The purpose of the project was to install two additional power generation units (40MW each) — known as Unit 7 and Unit 8 —at the Nam Ngum 1 Hydropower Plant (HPP) in Keo-Oudom district within Vientiane province. The locational coordinates of the project site are 18.531068°N 102.547577°E. DEC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. However, it appears to have hired Sinohydro Corporation Engineering Bureau 15 Co. Ltd. as a subcontractor.   Construction commenced in May 2015. The first power generation unit (Unit 7) and second power generation unit (Unit 8) successfully passed a 72-hour trial operation on April 10, 2018. The project was completed and the power plant was officially inaugurated on May 28, 2018.",TRUE,NA,GREEN,HIGH,Hydropower,"Primary purpose is expansion of hydropower capacity, a renewable energy source","80MW hydropower expansion project, installation of two 40MW power generation units at existing hydropower plant"
