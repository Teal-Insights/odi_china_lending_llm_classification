40983,HEALTH,Chinese Government provides $10.8 million interest-free loan for Prince Hussein Bin Abdullah II Hospital Construction Project,"In 2008, the Chinese Government and the Government of Jordan signed a $10,800,000 interest-free loan agreement for the Prince Hussein Bin Abdullah II Hospital Construction Project. The loan proceeds were apparently drawn from two Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) that the two governments signed on December 6, 1999 (worth RMB 50 million) and December 15, 2003 (worth RMB 30 million).   The project involved the construction of a 100-bed hospital (Prince Hussein Bin Abdullah II Hospital) in the district of Ein Al Basha and the Governorate of Balqa (Balqā). The ultimate purpose of the project was to provide upgraded health facilities to the Governorate of Balqa where as many as 300,000 people (including 180,000 Palestinian refugees) could benefit from the hospital's services. Prior to the hospital's construction, there was no major medical facility within Governorate of Balqa. The hospital's location was designed to travel times for emergency patients.   China Chongqing International Construction Corporation (CICO) was the contractor responsible for implementation. A project design contract was issued on December 18, 2003. Then, on November 29, 2007, a project implementation contract was issued. On April 23, 2008, project implementation commenced and a commencement ceremony took place at the project site. On September 14, 2010, the hospital construction project was completed and officially inaugurated by King Abdullah II and Queen Rania of Jordan.","1. This project is also known as the Balqa Hospital Project and the Baqa’a Hospital Project. The Chinese project title is 巴卡医院项目 or 约旦巴卡医院项目. The Arabic project title is مستشفى الأمير حسين الحكومي. 2. According to April 2018 correspondence between AidData’s Executive Director and the Public Debt Department of Jordan’s Ministry of Finance, the two interest-free loans that were signed on December 6, 1999 (Ministry of Finance loan identification #EC22013) and December 15, 2003 (Ministry of Finance loan identification #EC22020) fully disbursed. However, it is unclear if the combined value of these two loans were disbursed in support of the Prince Hussein Bin Abdullah II Hospital Construction Project. This issue merits further investigation.3. Since the borrowing terms of the interest-free loan are unavailable, AidData has set the maturity to 20 years by default and grace period to 10 years by default, per China's Foreign Assistance White Paper (http://www.cidca.gov.cn/2018-08/06/c_129925064_3.htm) which states that the maturity of interest-free loans is 20 years, with a drawdown period of 5 years, grace period of 5 years, and repayment over 10 years. AidData treats the drawdown period as providing 5 years of additional grace.","# Sector

Then, in February 2008, JSC KazTransGas and Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited — a wholly owned subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) — created a special purpose vehicle called Asia Gas Pipeline LLP (AGP) to construct, finance, and operate the Kazakh Section of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline Project. KazTransGas and CNPC each hold a 50% equity stake in AGP.   On October 22, 2008, AGP entered into a $7.5 billion syndicated facility (loan) agreement with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) for the Kazakh Section of Lines A and B of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline Project.  The loan facility bore interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 2.15% margin per annum during the CNPC loan repayment guarantee period and 3-month LIBOR plus a 2.9% margin per annum thereafter. The loan is to be repaid in several installments beginning in March 2013 until December 23, 2023. Therefore, the loan’s implied grace period is 4.5 years and its implied maturity length is 15 years. CNPC issued a loan repayment guarantee that was effective until March 28, 2020 on the condition that borrower would subsequently sign 'ship & pay' agreements with the CNPC group of companies by September 28, 2019. After the expiry of the CNPC repayment guarantee, the loan's margin increased from 2.15% to 2.9%. The amounts due under this loan were secured by (collateralized against) account charges, a pledge over deposit certificate agreement, an insurance assignment, and the repayment guarantee from CNPC. As of December 31, 2017, the loan’s amount outstanding was $4,029,784,000. As of December 31, 2018, the loan’s amount outstanding was $2,700,836,000. The proceeds of the loan were used by the borrower to finance EPC contracts (for pipelines and compressors) with China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Corporation (CPECC), and KazStroyService (KSS).   The purpose of the project was to construct the Kazakh sections of Line A and Line B of the 1873 km Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline. These sections both measure 1300 km in length and they run parallel to each other in Southern Kazakhstan from Shymkent to the Alataw Pass. The pipeline then crosses the Kazakhstan-China border at Horgos (Xinjiang Province), where it connects to the West-East Gas Pipeline 2. The project also involved the construction of compressor stations along the Kazakh Section of Lines A and B. China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Corporation (CPECC), and KazStroyService (KSS) were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. A formal commencement ceremony took place on July 9, 2008. However, construction of the Kazakh section of the pipeline did not commence until August 1, 2008. Line A achieved 'state acceptance' on December 4, 2009. Then, on December 12, 2009, the Kazakh section of Line A was officially inaugurated. Line B achieved 'state acceptance' on October 18, 2010. On February 3, 2011, AGP obtained a general license for the operation of Line A and Line B. By October 20, 2012, all compressor stations along Line A and Line B of the Central Asia–China Gas Pipeline were operational, enabling the pipeline to transmit 30 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually. All of the compressor stations along Line A and Line B achieved ‘state acceptance’ between June 2012 and December 2012.   Then, on December 27, 2012, AGP entered into a $4.7 billion syndicated facility (loan) agreement with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) for the Kazakh Section of Line C of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline Project (captured via Projects ID#39997, #91926). The loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 2.35% margin per annum during the CNPC loan repayment guarantee period and 3-month LIBOR + a 3.45% per annum thereafter. The loan is to be repaid in several installments beginning in June 2017 until December 27, 2027. Therefore, the loan’s implied grace period is 4.5 years and its implied maturity length is 15 years. CNPC issued a loan repayment guarantee that was effective until March 28, 2020 on the condition that borrower would subsequently sign 'ship & pay' agreements with the CNPC group of companies by September 28, 2019. After the expiry of the CNPC repayment guarantee, the loan's margin increased from 2.35% to 3.45%. The loan was secured by (collateralized against) a ‘ship or pay’ transportation agreement pledge, account charges, insurance and reinsurance policies assignments, and the repayment guarantee from CNPC. As of December 31, 2017, the loan’s amount outstanding was $2,923,178,000. As of December 31, 2018, the loan’s amount outstanding was $2,511,324,000.   The purpose of the project was to construct the Kazakh section of Line C of the 1873 km Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline. This section measures 1300 km in length and runs parallel to Lines A and B in Southern Kazakhstan from Shymkent to the Alataw Pass. The pipeline then crosses the Kazakhstan-China border at Horgos (Xinjiang Province), where it connects to the West-East Gas Pipeline 2. The project also involved the construction of compressor stations along the Kazakh Section of Line C. Line C has a designed capacity of 25 billion cubic meters per annum, and its pipe diameter is 1,219 mm, 152 mm larger than Line A/B. Upon completion of all supporting facilities of Line C, the overall delivery capacity of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline was expected to reach 55 billion cubic meters per annum, equaling approximately 20% of China’s annual natural gas consumption while annually substituting 73 million tons of coal and cutting carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions by 78 million tons and 1.21 million tons, respectively.   China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Corporation (CPECC), and KazStroyService (KSS) were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. It was originally envisaged that the construction of Line C would take place between January 2012 and January 2014. However, the construction of Line C did not begin until January 16, 2013. The overall welding work of the pipeline was completed at the end of 2013. Line C went into operation on May 31, 2014. Line C was officially commissioned on June 9, 2015. Its compressor stations achieved ‘state acceptance’ between July 2015 and October 2018. Line C successfully transmitted gas to Khorgas on June 15, 2017. Line C’s Supervisory Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) — a software communication system that allows for various gas production sites to communicate with each other — achieved ‘state acceptance’ in November 2018.","1.

The Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline—also known as the Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline or the Asia Gas Pipeline—is a 1,873-kilometer long gas pipeline connecting Turkmenistan to China via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, which delivers gas equal to approximately 20% of China’s annual natural gas consumption. It consists of 4 lines (A, B, C, and D). Lines A, B, and C run parallel to each other. These three pipelines begin at Gedaim on the Turkmen-Uzbek border, run through central Uzbekistan and southern Kazakhstan, and end at Khorgas in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Roughly 188 kilometers of Lines A-C are in Turkmenistan, roughly 529 (or 530) kilometers of Lines A-C are in Kazakhstan, and roughly 1115 (or 1300) kilometers of of Lines A-C run from Kazakhstan to China. Line D, which is still under construction, will be 966 kilometers in length and connect Galkynysh to western China via Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. It will originate at the Galkynysh gas field in Turkmenistan. Then, in Tajikistan, Line D will run through Tursunzoda, Shahrinav, Hisor, Roudaki, Vahdat, Fayzobod, Nourobod, Rasht and Lakhsh (formerly Jirgatol) to Kyrgyzstan’s border. It will then go through Kyrgyzstan, crossing into China near the village of Irkeshtam on the Kyrgyzstan-China border. The Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline is supplied from the Galkynysh and Dauletabad gas fields, as well as from the Bagtyyarlyk gas field in Turkmenistan, where it originates. The pipeline is also supplied with gas from the Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to which it is linked in Shymkent, Kazakhstan. The Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent Gas Pipeline delivers gas originating in gas fields of Kazakhstan. Line A and Line B connect to the Second West-East Gas Pipeline, while Line C connects to the Third West-East Gas Pipeline. Line D, which is under construction, will connect to the Fifth West-East Gas Pipeline. Line A, B, and C provide 55 billion cubic meters (bcm) of gas to China per annum. Line D is planned to have capacity of 30 bcm/year.6. The construction of the China-Central Asia Gas Pipeline was financed through a series of Chinese loans and equity investments: $7.5 billion syndicated CDB/BoC loan for Kazakh Section of Lines A and B (captured via Projects ID#54489, #91923); $4.7 billion syndicated CDB/BoC loan for the Kazakh Section of Line C (captured via Projects ID#39997, #91926); $3.5 billion syndicated CDB/BoC loan for the Uzbek Sections of Lines A and B (captured via Projects ID#91901, #91917); $1.4 billion syndicated CDB/BoC loan for the Uzbek Section of Line C (captured via Projects ID#54528 #91898); $300 million CNPC Finance loan for Tajik Section of Line D (captured via Project ID#39955); and $300 million equity investment from Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited for Line D of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline Project (captured via Project ID#70616).","# Sector

Then, in February 2008, JSC KazTransGas and Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited — a wholly owned subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) — created a special purpose vehicle called Asia Gas Pipeline LLP (AGP) to construct, finance, and operate the Kazakh Section of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline Project. KazTransGas and CNPC each hold a 50% equity stake in AGP.   On October 22, 2008, AGP entered into a $7.5 billion syndicated facility (loan) agreement with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) for the Kazakh Section of Lines A and B of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline Project.  The loan facility bore interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 2.15% margin per annum during the CNPC loan repayment guarantee period and 3-month LIBOR plus a 2.9% margin per annum thereafter. The loan is to be repaid in several installments beginning in March 2013 until December 23, 2023. Therefore, the loan’s implied grace period is 4.5 years and its implied maturity length is 15 years. CNPC issued a loan repayment guarantee that was effective until March 28, 2020 on the condition that borrower would subsequently sign 'ship & pay' agreements with the CNPC group of companies by September 28, 2019. After the expiry of the CNPC repayment guarantee, the loan's margin increased from 2.15% to 2.9%. The amounts due under this loan were secured by (collateralized against) account charges, a pledge over deposit certificate agreement, an insurance assignment, and the repayment guarantee from CNPC. As of December 31, 2017, the loan’s amount outstanding was $4,029,784,000. As of December 31, 2018, the loan’s amount outstanding was $2,700,836,000. The proceeds of the loan were used by the borrower to finance EPC contracts (for pipelines and compressors) with China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Corporation (CPECC), and KazStroyService (KSS).   The purpose of the project was to construct the Kazakh sections of Line A and Line B of the 1873 km Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline. These sections both measure 1300 km in length and they run parallel to each other in Southern Kazakhstan from Shymkent to the Alataw Pass. The pipeline then crosses the Kazakhstan-China border at Horgos (Xinjiang Province), where it connects to the West-East Gas Pipeline 2. The project also involved the construction of compressor stations along the Kazakh Section of Lines A and B. China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Corporation (CPECC), and KazStroyService (KSS) were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. A formal commencement ceremony took place on July 9, 2008. However, construction of the Kazakh section of the pipeline did not commence until August 1, 2008. Line A achieved 'state acceptance' on December 4, 2009. Then, on December 12, 2009, the Kazakh section of Line A was officially inaugurated. Line B achieved 'state acceptance' on October 18, 2010. On February 3, 2011, AGP obtained a general license for the operation of Line A and Line B. By October 20, 2012, all compressor stations along Line A and Line B of the Central Asia–China Gas Pipeline were operational, enabling the pipeline to transmit 30 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually. All of the compressor stations along Line A and Line B achieved ‘state acceptance’ between June 2012 and December 2012.   Then, on December 27, 2012, AGP entered into a $4.7 billion syndicated facility (loan) agreement with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) for the Kazakh Section of Line C of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline Project (captured via Projects ID#39997, #91926). The loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 2.35% margin per annum during the CNPC loan repayment guarantee period and 3-month LIBOR + a 3.45% per annum thereafter. The loan is to be repaid in several installments beginning in June 2017 until December 27, 2027. Therefore, the loan’s implied grace period is 4.5 years and its implied maturity length is 15 years. CNPC issued a loan repayment guarantee that was effective until March 28, 2020 on the condition that borrower would subsequently sign 'ship & pay' agreements with the CNPC group of companies by September 28, 2019. After the expiry of the CNPC repayment guarantee, the loan's margin increased from 2.35% to 3.45%. The loan was secured by (collateralized against) a ‘ship or pay’ transportation agreement pledge, account charges, insurance and reinsurance policies assignments, and the repayment guarantee from CNPC. As of December 31, 2017, the loan’s amount outstanding was $2,923,178,000. As of December 31, 2018, the loan’s amount outstanding was $2,511,324,000.   The purpose of the project was to construct the Kazakh section of Line C of the 1873 km Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline. This section measures 1300 km in length and runs parallel to Lines A and B in Southern Kazakhstan from Shymkent to the Alataw Pass. The pipeline then crosses the Kazakhstan-China border at Horgos (Xinjiang Province), where it connects to the West-East Gas Pipeline 2. The project also involved the construction of compressor stations along the Kazakh Section of Line C. Line C has a designed capacity of 25 billion cubic meters per annum, and its pipe diameter is 1,219 mm, 152 mm larger than Line A/B. Upon completion of all supporting facilities of Line C, the overall delivery capacity of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline was expected to reach 55 billion cubic meters per annum, equaling approximately 20% of China’s annual natural gas consumption while annually substituting 73 million tons of coal and cutting carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions by 78 million tons and 1.21 million tons, respectively.   China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Corporation (CPECC), and KazStroyService (KSS) were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. It was originally envisaged that the construction of Line C would take place between January 2012 and January 2014. However, the construction of Line C did not begin until January 16, 2013. The overall welding work of the pipeline was completed at the end of 2013. Line C went into operation on May 31, 2014. Line C was officially commissioned on June 9, 2015. Its compressor stations achieved ‘state acceptance’ between July 2015 and October 2018. Line C successfully transmitted gas to Khorgas on June 15, 2017. Line C’s Supervisory Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) — a software communication system that allows for various gas production sites to communicate with each other — achieved ‘state acceptance’ in November 2018.",TRUE,NA,BROWN,HIGH,Oil and Gas Infrastructure,"Project involves construction of natural gas pipelines and related infrastructure, which primarily supports fossil fuel transportation and use","Construction of 1300 km gas pipeline sections (Lines A, B, and C), compressor stations, and connection to West-East Gas Pipeline 2 for natural gas transmission"

KCP had the right to draw down the loan in four tranches. It drew down three tranches in 2008 in an aggregate principal amount of $1 billion. The availability period of this credit facility expired at the end of 2011. The borrowed funds bore an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2% margin per annum until February 2013 and 6-month LIBOR plus a 4% margin per annum thereafter. CNPC provided a guarantee for the loan. The borrower also purchased credit insurance from Sinosure. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this facility was $403.9 million USD (including the capitalized interest) (₸134.3 billion KZT). The borrower was responsible for repaying the loan with profit (net income) from the Kenkiyak-Kumkol Section of the Kazakhstan-China Oil Pipeline.   JSC KazTransOil (KTO) and China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Corporation (CNODC) formed a joint venture Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) called Kazakhstan-China Pipeline LLP (KCP) on July 6, 2004, each with a 50% stake. KCP was created to construct and operate the Atasu-Alashankou Pipeline and the Kenkiyak-Kumkol Pipeline. These pipelines are two of three pipeline systems of the Kazakhstan-China Pipeline Network, which was built to create a transport corridor for the export of Kazakhstani oil to China.   The purpose of the $1.18 billion loan facility was to finance the construction the Kenkiyak–Kumkol pipeline section, which was intended to transport oil from West Kazakhstan and Aktobe oilfields. It began in Kenkiyak and ended in Kumkol. The pipeline was 794.263 km long and it had a maximum capacity of 10 million tons a year. It included relay pump stations to increase the volume of oil transported. The pipe had diameters ranging between 0.5 and 1.8 meters. The Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline passed through the Aktobe, Kyzylorda and Karaganda regions, with its oil destined for the Chinese market.   JSC OGCC KazStroyService was responsible for the construction of the 483 km section from Kenkiyak to Aralsk, while China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering Co., Ltd. (CPPE) was responsible for the construction of a 311 km section to Kumkol. Construction of the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline began on December 11, 2007. The pipeline went into operation on October 6, 2009. As of December 31, 2017, the pipeline had a throughput capacity of 9.2 million tonnes of crude oil per year. In 2017, 5.2 million tonnes of crude oil were transported through the pipeline.   Pursuant to an agreement between the KTO and CNODC, the capacity of the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline was increased from 10.0 million tonnes of crude oil per year to 20.0 million tonnes in 2015 so as to take advantage of expected increased production at Tengiz Field and Kashagan Field. Ten companies supply oil to the pipeline, which KCP has continued to own.   The Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network is comprised of three systems: (i) the Kenkiyak-Atyrau pipeline, from Kenkiyak in western Kazakhstan to Atyrau on the Caspian Sea (see Project ID#54523); (ii) the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline, from Atasu in eastern Kazakhstan to Alashankou in western China (see Project ID#39605); and (iii) the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline, from Kenkiyak to Kumkol in south Kazakhstan (see Project ID#54524). All three systems are operational.","1. The breakdown of loan amounts between the 2 financiers (ICBC and ING Bank N.V) is not known. For the time being, AidData has estimated the contribution of ICBC by assuming that the two lenders contributed equal amounts ($590 million) to the loan syndicate. 2. Some sources refer to the face value of the August 2008 loan as $1,033,098,000. This issue warrants further investigation. 3. Based on the information provided in the project description and the underlying sources, AidData has coded the maturity length as 10 years and the grace period as zero. The all-in interest rate (5.108%) was estimated by adding 2% to average 6-Month LIBOR in August 2008 (3.108%). 4.
