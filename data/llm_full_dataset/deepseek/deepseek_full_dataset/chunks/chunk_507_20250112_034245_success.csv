89467,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,"Sinohydro provides $93.8 million — via deferred payment agreement — for Accra Inner City Roads (Phase 1, Lot 1) Project (Linked to Project ID#60154)","On May 16, 2018, the Government of Ghana signed a master project support agreement (MPSA) with Sinohydro Corporation Limited (‘SInohydro’) for an amount of up to $2 billion for the construction of priority infrastructure projects. The MPSA was then approved by Ghana’s Parliament on July 28, 2018. All borrowings that takes place under the MPSA carry a maturity of 15 years, a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.80% margin, a 2% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.70% management fee, a 0.50% commitment fee, and a lump sum Sinosure insurance premium of 7%. Loan repayments will be made with the proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite (after the Government of Ghana establishes a bauxite processing plant), with repayments starting approximately three years after the effective date of the agreement. The proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite will be placed in an offshore escrow account by the offtaker for the benefit of Ghana Integrated Aluminium Development Corporation (GIADC) and Sinohydro.  If the value of bauxite decreases, or if bauxite reserves are lower than expected, the Government of Ghana may have to deliver higher volumes of bauxite than anticipated or find alternative means of repayment. While the Government of Ghana does not currently treat borrowings (via deferred payment agreements or DPAs) under the Sinohydro MPSA as external debt, depending on various factors and events and as a result of the deferred payment structure, they could in the future become repayment obligations of the Government of Ghana. The agreement structure seeks to ensure that the obligations of GIADC (the obligor) will not add to the Government of Ghana’s debt stock. If GIADC fails to comply with its collateral or repayment obligations, Sinohydro is entitled to prepayment of outstanding loan balances and may seize the full balance of the escrow account. Sinohydro, which is itself borrowing from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) to finance infrastructure projects under the MPSA, decided to approve funding for infrastructure projects under the MPSA in phases.   The first phase consists of 10 road projects (underpinning by 10 EPC contracts) that are collectively worth $646,637,879.74: Accra Inner City Roads Project (Phase 1, Lot 1 Project), Kumasi Inner City Roads Project (Phase 1, Lot 2), Tamale Interchange Project, PTC Interchange Takoradi Project (also known as PTC Roundabout Interchange Project, Takoradi), Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway Project (also known as Construction of 14 km Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway Project), Sunyani Inner City Roads Project, Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads Project, Upgrading of Selected Feeder Roads in Ashanti and Western Region Project, Rehabilitation of Oda Ofoase-Abirem Road Project (also known as 38 km Rehabilitation of New Abirem-Afoasekuma-Akim Oda Road), and Hohoe-Jasikan-Dodi Pepesu Road Project (also known as 56.40 km Construction of Hohoe-Jasikan-Dodo Pepesu Road Project).   Each of these projects is being financed through a separate DPA. Under the terms of the MPSA, 'deferred payments' refer to payments due to Sinohydro under a given EPC contract to be made by Ghana's Ministry of Finance using the proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite that have been deferred up to the repayment dates stipulated in the repayment schedules of the DPAs. The DPA for the Accra Inner City Roads Project (Phase 1, Lot 1 Project) was signed by Ghana’s Ministry of Roads and Highways, Ghana’s Ministry of Finance, and Sinohydro on September 1, 2018. Under this DPA, which is captured via Project ID#89467, Sinohydro provided $93,897,686.91 of financing to cover 85% of the total cost of the EPC contract ($72,837,698.14) plus the cost of accrued interest and fees during the 30-month construction period.   The scope of the Accra Inner City Roads Project (Phase 1, Lot 1 Project) covers a set of roads measuring 85 km in length in 5 municipal assemblies across the Greater Accra Region: a 19.03 km road from Ga North to Trobu, a 23.97 km road from Ga Central to Anyaa Sowutoum, a 21.70 km road from Ga East to Dome Kwabenya, an 11.3 m road from Ledzokuku to Teshie, and an 8 km road from Adenta to Santeo via Nanakrom. The project, which was originally expected to be completed within a period of 30 months (beginning during the first quarter of 2019), involves (1) road works which involve earthworks, provision of sub-base and base works, surface dressing and road line markings; (2) drainage works involving the construction of roadside drain, culvert, and storm drains; (3) construction of pedestrian and public transport walk ways and laybys; and (4) the provision of services like road safety audits and pedestrian facilities.

Sinohydro provides $46.2 million — via deferred payment agreement — for Tamale Interchange (Phase 1, Lot 3) Project (Linked to Project ID#60154)

# Description
On May 16, 2018, the Government of Ghana signed a master project support agreement (MPSA) with Sinohydro Corporation Limited (‘Sinohydro’) for an amount of up to $2 billion for the construction of priority infrastructure projects. The MPSA was then approved by Ghana’s Parliament on July 28, 2018. All borrowings that take place under the MPSA carry a maturity of 15 years, a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.80% margin, a 2% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.70% management fee, a 0.50% commitment fee, and a lump sum Sinosure insurance premium of 7%. Loan repayments will be made with the proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite (after the Government of Ghana establishes a bauxite processing plant), with repayments starting approximately three years after the effective date of the agreement. The proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite will be placed in an offshore escrow account by the offtaker for the benefit of Ghana Integrated Aluminium Development Corporation (GIADC) and Sinohydro.    If the value of bauxite decreases, or if bauxite reserves are lower than expected, the Government of Ghana may have to deliver higher volumes of bauxite than anticipated or find alternative means of repayment. While the Government of Ghana does not currently treat borrowings (via deferred payment agreements or DPAs) under the Sinohydro MPSA as external debt, depending on various factors and events and as a result of the deferred payment structure, they could in the future become repayment obligations of the Government of Ghana. The agreement structure seeks to ensure that the obligations of GIADC (the obligor) will not add to the Government of Ghana’s debt stock. If GIADC fails to comply with its collateral or repayment obligations, Sinohydro is entitled to prepayment of outstanding loan balances and may seize the full balance of the escrow account.

Sinohydro provides $83.8 million — via deferred payment agreement — for Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway (Phase 1, Lot 5) Project (Linked to Project ID#60154)

# Description
On May 16, 2018, the Government of Ghana signed a master project support agreement (MPSA) with Sinohydro Corporation Limited (‘SInohydro’) for an amount of up to $2 billion for the construction of priority infrastructure projects. The MPSA was then approved by Ghana’s Parliament on July 28, 2018. All borrowings that take place under the MPSA carry a maturity of 15 years, a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.80% margin, a 2% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.70% management fee, a 0.50% commitment fee, and a lump sum Sinosure insurance premium of 7%. Loan repayments will be made with the proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite (after the Government of Ghana establishes a bauxite processing plant), with repayments starting approximately three years after the effective date of the agreement. The proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite will be placed in an offshore escrow account by the offtaker for the benefit of Ghana Integrated Aluminium Development Corporation (GIADC) and Sinohydro.    If the value of bauxite decreases, or if bauxite reserves are lower than expected, the Government of Ghana may have to deliver higher volumes of bauxite than anticipated or find alternative means of repayment. While the Government of Ghana does not currently treat borrowings (via deferred payment agreements or DPAs) under the Sinohydro MPSA as external debt, depending on various factors and events and as a result of the deferred payment structure, they could in the future become repayment obligations of the Government of Ghana. The agreement structure seeks to ensure that the obligations of GIADC (the obligor) will not add to the Government of Ghana’s debt stock. If GIADC fails to comply with its collateral or repayment obligations, Sinohydro is entitled to prepayment of outstanding loan balances and may seize the full balance of the escrow account.   Sinohydro, which is itself borrowing from China Construction Bank to finance infrastructure projects under the MPSA, decided to approve funding for infrastructure projects under the MPSA in phases. The first phase consists of 10 road projects (underpinned by 10 EPC contracts) that are collectively worth $646,637,879.74: Accra Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 1 Project), Kumasi Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 2 Project), Tamale Interchange Project (or Phase 1, Lot 3 Project), PTC Interchange Takoradi Project (or Phase 1, Lot 4 Project and the PTC Roundabout Interchange Project, Takoradi), Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway Project (or Phase 1, Lot 5 Project and the Construction of 14 km Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway Project), Sunyani Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 6 Project), Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 7 Project), Upgrading of Selected Feeder Roads in Ashanti and Western Region Project (or Phase 1, Lot 8 Project, Rehabilitation of Oda Ofoase-Abirem Road Project (or Phase 1, Lot 9 Project and 38 km Rehabilitation of New Abirem-Afoasekuma-Akim Oda Road project), and Hohoe-Jasikan-Dodi Pepesu Road Project (or Phase 1, Lot 10 Project and 56.40 km Construction of Hohoe-Jasikan-Dodo Pepesu Road Project). Each of these projects is being financed through a separate DPA. Under the terms of the MPSA, 'deferred payments' refer to payments due to Sinohydro under a given EPC contract to be made by Ghana's Ministry of Finance using the proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite that have been deferred up to the repayment dates stipulated in the repayment schedules of the DPAs.

Sinohydro provides $46.8 million — via deferred payment agreement — for Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads (Phase 1, Lot 7) Project (Linked to Project ID#60154)

# Description
On May 16, 2018, the Government of Ghana signed a master project support agreement (MPSA) with Sinohydro Corporation Limited (‘Sinohydro’) for an amount of up to $2 billion for the construction of priority infrastructure projects. The MPSA was then approved by Ghana’s Parliament on July 28, 2018. All borrowings that take place under the MPSA carry a maturity of 15 years, a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.80% margin, a 2% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.70% management fee, a 0.50% commitment fee, and a lump sum Sinosure insurance premium of 7%. Loan repayments will be made with the proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite (after the Government of Ghana establishes a bauxite processing plant), with repayments starting approximately three years after the effective date of the agreement. The proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite will be placed in an offshore escrow account by the offtaker for the benefit of Ghana Integrated Aluminium Development Corporation (GIADC) and Sinohydro.    If the value of bauxite decreases, or if bauxite reserves are lower than expected, the Government of Ghana may have to deliver higher volumes of bauxite than anticipated or find alternative means of repayment. While the Government of Ghana does not currently treat borrowings (via deferred payment agreements or DPAs) under the Sinohydro MPSA as external debt, depending on various factors and events and as a result of the deferred payment structure, they could in the future become repayment obligations of the Government of Ghana. The agreement structure seeks to ensure that the obligations of GIADC (the obligor) will not add to the Government of Ghana’s debt stock. If GIADC fails to comply with its collateral or repayment obligations, Sinohydro is entitled to prepayment of outstanding loan balances and may seize the full balance of the escrow account.   Sinohydro, which is itself borrowing from China Construction Bank to finance infrastructure projects under the MPSA, decided to approve funding for infrastructure projects under the MPSA in phases. The first phase consists of 10 road projects (underpinned by 10 EPC contracts) that are collectively worth $646,637,879.74: Accra Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 1 Project), Kumasi Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 2 Project), Tamale Interchange Project (or Phase 1, Lot 3 Project), PTC Interchange Takoradi Project (or Phase 1, Lot 4 Project and the PTC Roundabout Interchange Project, Takoradi), Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway Project (or Phase 1, Lot 5 Project and the Construction of 14 km Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway Project), Sunyani Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 6 Project), Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 7 Project), Upgrading of Selected Feeder Roads in Ashanti and Western Region Project (or Phase 1, Lot 8 Project, Rehabilitation of Oda Ofoase-Abirem Road Project (or Phase 1, Lot 9 Project and 38 km Rehabilitation of New Abirem-Afoasekuma-Akim Oda Road project), and Hohoe-Jasikan-Dodi Pepesu Road Project (or Phase 1, Lot 10 Project and 56.40 km Construction of Hohoe-Jasikan-Dodo Pepesu Road Project).    Each of these projects is being financed through a separate DPA. Under the terms of the MPSA, 'deferred payments' refer to payments due to Sinohydro under a given EPC contract to be made by Ghana's Ministry of Finance using the proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite that have been deferred up to the repayment dates stipulated in the repayment schedules of the DPAs. The DPA for the Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads (Phase 1, Lot 7) Project was signed by Ghana’s Ministry of Roads and Highways, Ghana’s Ministry of Finance, and Sinohydro on September 1, 2018. Under this DPA, which is captured via Project ID#89473, Sinohydro provided $46,852,015.86 of financing to cover 85% of the total cost of the EPC contract ($35,817,641.64) plus the cost of accrued interest and fees during the 30-month construction period.    The scope of the Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads (Phase 1, Lot 7) Project covers construction of the roads in the Western Region and Central Region (specifically, Cape Coast and Prestea inner city roads). The project, which was originally expected to be completed within a period of 30 months, involves 22 km of Cape Coast roads, 3 km of Akotokyir Area roads, 7 km of Abura New Community Area Roads, 3 km of Polytechnic Area Roads, 3 km of Apawusika Roads and Links, and 10.19 km of Prestea Town Roads.

Under this DPA, which is captured via Project ID#89475, Sinohydro provided $39,879,855.47 of financing to cover 85% of the total cost of the EPC contract ($30,368,871.65) plus the cost of accrued interest and fees during the 30-month construction period.    The scope of this project covers the rehabilitation of the 38 km Akim Oda/Ofoase road (also known as the Akim Oda/Ofoase/Abirem road), which passes through several rural communities that connect Oda to Ofoase. This road is part of the trunk road network (IR3) of Ghana. The works scope involves earthworks, the provision of sub-based and base double surface dressing with road line markings and signs. Sinohydro is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. This project was originally expected to be completed within a period 30 months. However, as of September 2021, project implementation had not yet commenced.","1.

Sinohydro provides $39.8 million — via deferred payment agreement — for Rehabilitation of Oda Ofoase-Abirem Road (Phase 1, Lot 9) Project (Linked to Project ID#60154)

# Description
On May 16, 2018, the Government of Ghana signed a master project support agreement (MPSA) with Sinohydro Corporation Limited (‘SInohydro’) for an amount of up to $2 billion for the construction of priority infrastructure projects. The MPSA was then approved by Ghana’s Parliament on July 28, 2018. All borrowings that take place under the MPSA carry a maturity of 15 years, a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.80% margin, a 2% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.70% management fee, a 0.50% commitment fee, and a lump sum Sinosure insurance premium of 7%. Loan repayments will be made with the proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite (after the Government of Ghana establishes a bauxite processing plant), with repayments starting approximately three years after the effective date of the agreement. The proceeds from the sale of refined bauxite will be placed in an offshore escrow account by the offtaker for the benefit of Ghana Integrated Aluminium Development Corporation (GIADC) and Sinohydro.    If the value of bauxite decreases, or if bauxite reserves are lower than expected, the Government of Ghana may have to deliver higher volumes of bauxite than anticipated or find alternative means of repayment. While the Government of Ghana does not currently treat borrowings (via deferred payment agreements or DPAs) under the Sinohydro MPSA as external debt, depending on various factors and events and as a result of the deferred payment structure, they could in the future become repayment obligations of the Government of Ghana. The agreement structure seeks to ensure that the obligations of GIADC (the obligor) will not add to the Government of Ghana’s debt stock. If GIADC fails to comply with its collateral or repayment obligations, Sinohydro is entitled to prepayment of outstanding loan balances and may seize the full balance of the escrow account. Sinohydro, which is itself borrowing from China Construction Bank to finance infrastructure projects under the MPSA, decided to approve funding for infrastructure projects under the MPSA in phases. The first phase consists of 10 road projects (underpinned by 10 EPC contracts) that are collectively worth $646,637,879.74: Accra Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 1 Project), Kumasi Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 2 Project), Tamale Interchange Project (or Phase 1, Lot 3 Project), PTC Interchange Takoradi Project (or Phase 1, Lot 4 Project and the PTC Roundabout Interchange Project, Takoradi), Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway Project (or Phase 1, Lot 5 Project and the Construction of 14 km Adenta-Dodowa Dual Carriageway Project), Sunyani Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 6 Project), Western Region and Cape Coast Inner City Roads Project (or Phase 1, Lot 7 Project), Upgrading of Selected Feeder Roads in Ashanti and Western Region Project (or Phase 1, Lot 8 Project, Rehabilitation of Oda Ofoase-Abirem Road Project (or Phase 1, Lot 9 Project and 38 km Rehabilitation of New Abirem-Afoasekuma-Akim Oda Road project), and Hohoe-Jasikan-Dodi Pepesu Road Project (or Phase 1, Lot 10 Project and 56.40 km Construction of Hohoe-Jasikan-Dodo Pepesu Road Project).
