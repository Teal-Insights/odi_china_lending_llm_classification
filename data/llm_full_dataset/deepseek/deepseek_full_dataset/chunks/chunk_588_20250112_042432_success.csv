96437,BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES,CBVS makes RMB 952.7 million drawdown under currency swap agreement with PBOC in 2018,"On March 18, 2015, the Central Bank of Suriname (CBVS) and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) signed an RMB 1 billion (SRG 520 million) bilateral currency swap agreement to facilitate trade and improve foreign currency liquidity in Suriname. CBVS made three (gross) drawdowns under this currency swap agreement in 2015 and 2016: an RMB 800,000,000 drawdown (Tranche 1) between April 30, 2015 and May 2, 2016, an RMB 150,000,000 drawdown (Tranche 2) between June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2016, and an RMB 50,000,000 drawdown (Tranche 3) between October 23, 2015 and October 24, 2016. The interest rate that applied to these borrowings is unknown. However, it is known that the maturity of each borrowing was approximately 1 year (12 months).  Tranche 1 is captured via ID#89431. Tranche 2 is captured via Project ID#89432. Tranche 3 is captured via Project ID#89433. CBVS made at least one additional (gross) drawdown worth RMB 1 billion in 2016 (captured via Project ID#96416). The interest rate that applied to this borrowing is unknown. However, it is known that the maturity of the borrowing was approximately 1 year (12 months).   Then, the RMB 1 billion swap agreement between CBVS and the PBOC was ‘extended’ in 2017 and CBVS made three additional (gross) drawdowns under the extended agreement: an RMB 800,000,000 drawdown (Tranche 1) between May 11, 2017 to May 11, 2018, an RMB 150,000,000 drawdown (Tranche 2) between July 11, 2017 to July 11, 2018, and an RMB 50,000,000 drawdown (Tranche 3) between November 6, 2017 to February 6, 2018.

Then, on February 11, 2019, the CBVS and the PBOC renewed their RMB 1 billion (SRG 520 million) bilateral currency swap for another three years. CBVS made at least one additional (gross) drawdown worth RMB 983,449,719 million in 2019.   The interest rate that applied to this borrowing is unknown.

The 2020 drawdown is captured via Project ID#96434 and the 2021 drawdown is captured via Project ID#96435.   Then, in the first quarter of 2022, CBVS repaid approximately $155 million in outstanding swap debt to the PBOC.  The currency swap facility’s amount outstanding (outstanding balance) was RMB 1 billion as of December 21, 2015, RMB 1 billion as of December 21, 2016, RMB 1 billion as of December 21, 2017, RMB 952,718,000 as of December 31, 2018, RMB 983,449,719 as of December 31, 2019, RMB 1 billion as of December 31, 2020, RMB 1 billion as of December 31, 2021, and RMB 0 as of December 31, 2022.","1. A bilateral currency swap (BCS) agreement — also known as a central bank liquidity swap agreement — is an agreement between the central banks of two countries to exchange cash flows in different currencies at predetermined rates over a specified period of time. Central banks participate in these agreements to facilitate bilateral trade settlements using their national currencies (rather than relying upon on a third-party currency such as the U.S. dollar), manage demands from their local banks, and provide liquidity support to financial markets. The party that draws down on the swap line becomes the borrower and the other party becomes lender. During the term of the swap, the party that draws down on the swap line makes either fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amount. If both parties draw down on the swap line, then both parties exchange fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amounts. The 5-step process of drawing upon a currency swap line with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) can described from the perspective of an importer in a given country (‘Country X’) seeking to settle trade with a Chinese firm in RMB. Step 1: The central bank of Country X and the PBOC activate their currency swap in advance, at which point each party deposits a specific amount of its currency in an account controlled by the other party (i.e. the central bank of Country X deposits local currency in an account controlled by the PBOC, and the PBOC deposits an equivalent amount in RMB in an account controlled by the central bank of Country X). Step 2: A firm in Country X that imports goods from China applies for an RMB-denominated loan from a domestic bank. Step 3: The domestic bank in Country X that receives the loan application then applies to its central bank for an RMB-denominated loan. After a review process, the central bank of Country X notifies the domestic bank applicant that its loan application was approved. The central bank of Country X subsequently requests that the PBOC transfer RMB funds from the central bank of Country X’s swap account within the PBOC to the loan applicant’s account with a corresponding bank in China. Step 4: The domestic bank in Country X directs the corresponding bank in China to transfer RMB funds into a Chinese exporter’s account, and the corresponding bank in China provides RMB funds to the Chinese exporter. Step 5: The importer in Country X repays the RMB-denominated loan at its maturity date. The domestic bank notifies the central bank of Country X of the repayment, and transfers RMB into the central bank’s account within the PBOC through the corresponding bank in China. For the central bank of Country X, the RMB deposit is an asset that should be recorded on its balance sheet as an official reserve asset denominated in RMB. The contra entry of this asset is the liability in the local currency of Country X that represents China’s claims in the central bank of Country X. This should be also recorded on the balance sheet of the central bank of Country X. At the time of the exchange of currencies, it should be recorded as an increase in assets and an increase in liabilities of the monetary authorities in the balance of payments. The reason why the PBOC uses this mechanism to provide renminbi liquidity to other central bank is to increase the speed, convenience, and volume of transactions between the two countries. More detailed information about currency swaps with the PBOC can be found at https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021210-print-pdf.ashx and https://thechinaguys.com/the-rise-of-the-renminbi-the-reality-of-bilateral-swap-agreements/ and https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2017/pdf/17-25a.pdf.   2. AidData treats drawdowns under BCS agreements with the PBOC as collateralized loans because, in a BCS arrangement, the currency of the borrower is held as collateral while the lender receives interest on the amount drawn down by the borrower until repayment is made.   3. A 2017 Financial Note published by Suriname’s Ministry of Finance indicates that CBVS’s foreign liabilities increased by $155 million due to one or more drawdowns on its currency swap with the PBC between April 2015 and June 2015.  4. Most central banks publish their end-of-year outstanding PBOC swap debt, but only a few report detailed transaction-level data on drawdowns during the year. Therefore, if no information on drawings is available, AidData assumes that total drawdowns during the reporting period equal the amount outstanding at the end of the reporting period (and vice versa). Since the (de jure) maturities of PBOC swap drawings are 12 months or less, this creates a lower bound estimate for actual drawdowns under the PBOC swap line.   5. PBOC swap debt is frequently rolled over. In central bank reports where one can only observe the year-end outstanding amount, no distinction between rollovers and drawdowns is possible. In these cases, one can derive (new) drawdowns as the difference between the current and last year’s outstanding swap debt stock. This measure essentially captures net lending through the PBOC swap line.  6. As of January 2023, the CBVS had not published annual reports for years 2020 and 2021 on its website. AidData treats RMB 1 billion as the gross drawdown value and amount outstanding in 2020 and 2021 given reporting of outstanding PBOC swap debt in IMF country reports and BOP statistics. A 2022 report by CBVS confirms that approximately $155 million in swap drawings were repaid in February 2022 (https://web.archive.org/web/20221004005835/https://sdmo.org/images/verslagen/Macro/Macrodata%202022-ENG.pdf).","# Sector

70442,GOVERNMENT AND CIVIL SOCIETY,Chinese Government provides EUR 10 million grant for Phase 1 of Safe City Project (Linked to Project ID#55437),"From June 8, 2017 to July 6, 2017, an 8-member delegation from China’s Radio Film & Television Design & Research Institute (DRFT) conducted a feasibility study for the Road Monitoring Project (also known as the Safe City Project) in Suriname. The Chinese Government subsequently issued a grant worth EUR 10 million in 2018 to facilitate the implementation of the first phase of the project. The purpose of Phase 1 was to (a) install 300 closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance cameras in the city of Paramaribo to monitor road safety and identify traffic crime, and (b) connect these cameras to a Command Center run by the Suriname National Security Directorate (DNVS). The software on all of the CCTV cameras was expected to be customized with license plate recognition and sound recording. Then, in 2019, the Chinese Government provided a $5 million grant for Phase 2 of the Safe City Project.  The purpose of Phase 2 was to install cameras in twenty locations in Wanica district, two locations in Albina, and three locations in Nieuwe Haven to monitor road safety and identify traffic crime. A key goal of Phase 2 was to connect these additional cameras to the Command Center by November 25, 2019. Then, on January 19, 2023, the Chinese Government and the Government of Suriname signed a $15 million grant agreement for Phase 3 of the Safe City Project. The agreement was signed by Suriname’s Minister of Justice and Police Kenneth Amoksi and China’s Ambassador to Suriname, Han Jing. The purpose of Phase 3 is to install CCTV surveillance cameras in all of the country’s other districts, with the exception of Sipaliwini district in the interior of Suriname. Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. is the contractor responsible for implementation of all phases of the Safe City Project.  Phase 1 was completed when the Command Center became operational at the end of December 2018. Phase 2 was completed when 60 CCTV cameras were put into use at 20 locations in Wanica district on February 21, 2020.  By July 2022, 378 CCTV cameras had been installed through the capital city and various districts through the Safe City Project. As of February 2023, Phase 3 had not yet commenced. The Safe City Project has become a source of local debate and controversy. Allegations have arisen that the project is not being implemented in a way that is consistent with the original agreement. There is also a lawsuit pending concerning the Safe City Project. The lawsuit was filed by a human rights organization called 'Foundation December 8, 1982' against the Government of Suriname. According to 'Foundation December 8, 1982', there is no legal basis for recording the movement of citizens nor any official oversight of the CCTV surveillance program.","1. An initial set of 300 CCTV cameras was installed in Paramaribo through the Safe City Project (see Project ID#55437), which was launched on December 28, 2018. 2. This project is also known as the Road Monitoring Project and the Traffic Safety Monitoring System Project and the Paramaribo Traffic Monitoring and Surveillance System Project. The Chinese project title is 苏里南交通安全监控系统项目. The Dutch project title is road monitoringsproject or Safe City-project or China camera surveillancesysteem or camera-surveillancesysteem project. 3.

From June 8, 2017 to July 6, 2017, an 8-member delegation from China’s Radio Film & Television Design & Research Institute (DRFT) conducted a feasibility study for the Road Monitoring Project (also known as the Safe City Project) in Suriname. The Chinese Government subsequently issued a grant worth EUR 10 million in 2018 to facilitate the implementation of the first phase of the project. The purpose of Phase 1 was to (a) install 300 closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance cameras in the city of Paramaribo to monitor road safety and identify traffic crime, and (b) connect these cameras to a Command Center run by the Suriname National Security Directorate (DNVS). The software on all of the CCTV cameras was expected to be customized with license plate recognition and sound recording. Then, in 2019, the Chinese Government provided a $5 million grant for Phase 2 of the Safe City Project.  The purpose of Phase 2 was to install cameras in twenty locations in Wanica district, two locations in Albina, and three locations in Nieuwe Haven to monitor road safety and identify traffic crime. A key goal of Phase 2 was to connect these additional cameras to the Command Center by November 25, 2019. Then, on January 19, 2023, the Chinese Government and the Government of Suriname signed a $15 million grant agreement for Phase 3 of the Safe City Project. The agreement was signed by Suriname’s Minister of Justice and Police Kenneth Amoksi and China’s Ambassador to Suriname, Han Jing. The purpose of Phase 3 is to install CCTV surveillance cameras in all of the country’s other districts, with the exception of Sipaliwini district in the interior of Suriname. Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. is the contractor responsible for implementation of all phases of the Safe City Project.  Phase 1 was completed when the Command Center became operational at the end of December 2018. Phase 2 was completed when 60 CCTV cameras were put into use at 20 locations in Wanica district on February 21, 2020.  By July 2022, 378 CCTV cameras had been installed through the capital city and various districts through the Safe City Project. As of February 2023, Phase 3 had not yet commenced. The Safe City Project has become a source of local debate and controversy. Allegations have arisen that the project is not being implemented in a way that is consistent with the original agreement. There is also a lawsuit pending concerning the Safe City Project. The lawsuit was filed by a human rights organization called 'Foundation December 8, 1982' against the Government of Suriname. According to 'Foundation December 8, 1982', there is no legal basis for recording the movement of citizens nor any official oversight of the CCTV surveillance program.",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,General Infrastructure,"Project focuses on surveillance infrastructure for public safety, with no direct environmental or energy transition impact","Installation of CCTV cameras, connection to Command Center, focus on road safety and traffic crime monitoring"
