59753,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides RMB 1.26 billion loan for Phase 1 of Entebbe International Airport Upgrading and Expansion Project,"On March 31, 2015, the Chinese Government and the Government of Uganda signed a preferential loan framework agreement for Phase 1 of the Entebbe International Airport Upgrading and Expansion Project. On the same day, China Eximbank and the Government of Uganda signed an RMB 1,260,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) loan agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2015) 6 TOTAL NO. (545)] for Phase 1 of the Entebbe International Airport Upgrading and Expansion Project.  Uganda’s Parliament then ratified the loan agreement on July 29, 2015. Several months later, on November 17, 2015, the Government of Uganda entered into a subsidiary, on-lending agreement with Uganda Civil Aviation Authority (UCAA). The borrowing terms of the GCL are as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.25% (RMB 3,150,000) management fee, and a 0.25% commitment fee. The first scheduled loan repayment date is April 1, 2022.   The GCL is secured by (collateralized against) airport revenues deposited in a lender-controlled bank account with a minimum cash balance requirement. A December 3, 2015 escrow account agreement between the Government of Uganda's Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development, Stanbic Bank Uganda Limited, UCAA, and China Eximbank specifies that the borrower must maintain a minimum cash balance in the repayment reserve account of RMB 25,200,000 during the loan’s grace period (equivalent to total payable interest for one year during the loan’s grace period) and RMB 98,870,000 during the loan’s repayment period (equivalent to total payable principal and interest for one year during the loan’s repayment period). The GCL agreement also specifies that the 'all the revenues (proceeds) of Entebbe International Airport (including but not limited to revenues generated from the Project) shall be applied in priority to payment of any and all amounts due and payable [to the lender].' Under the terms of an Escrow Account Agreement, UCAA also agreed to (a) seek secure advance approval from China Eximbank for any use of the airport revenues that it deposits in the escrow account; and (b) grant China Eximbank approval authority over the airport’s annual budgets.   The ultimate borrower/end-user (UCAA) is expected to use the GCL proceeds to finance a $200,000,000 commercial (EPC) contract between UCAA and China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), which was signed on October 8, 2014 and amended on January 12, 2015.   According to the Government of Uganda’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), this loan achieved a 78% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 26 loan disbursements (worth $156,639,169.44) between 2015 and 2021: a $60,124,334.71 disbursement on December 24, 2015, a $9,822,292.39 disbursement on November 15, 2016, a $4,473,339.53 disbursement on December 14, 2016, a $5,272,753.02 disbursement on March 29, 2017, a $2,363,019.84 disbursement on April 20, 2017, a $1,336,370.91 disbursement on May 25, 2017, a $1,237,900.78 disbursement on August 10, 2017, a $5,492,164.36 disbursement on November 21, 2017, a $3,445,536.22 disbursement on December 27, 2017, a $21,668,252.97 disbursement on April 19, 2019, a $3,032,693.76 disbursement on May 30, 2019, a $3,743,156.53 disbursement on August 22, 2019, a $3,074,851.76 disbursement on October 31, 2019, a $2,911,749.34 disbursement on November 25, 2019, a $2,683,403.29 disbursement on March 31, 2020, a $1,275,590.33 disbursement on April 27, 2020, a $3,197,241.55 disbursement on May 27, 2020, a $1,758,890.15 disbursement on July 24, 2020, a $1,831,735.75 disbursement on August 7, 2020, a $1,944,401.91 disbursement on September 28, 2020, a $3,835,965.97 disbursement on December 18, 2020, a $4,414,162.60 disbursement on November 24, 2021, a $3,128,465.91 disbursement on March 30, 2022, a $2,110,577.92 disbursement on August 17, 2022, a $1,314,054.62 disbursement on November 17, 2022, and a $1,146,263.31 disbursement on December 13, 2022.  According to the Uganda Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development's Report on Public Debt, Grants, Guarantees and Other Financial Liabilities for Financial Year 2021/2022, as of December 31, 2021, total loan disbursements amounted to $155,982,698.23 and the loan’s amount outstanding (including arrears) was $155,982,698.23.   The purpose of the project’s first phase is to upgrade and expand Entebbe International Airport. The airport is located at 5 minutes from the main campus of Kampala International University, near the town of Entebbe, on the shores of Lake Victoria, and approximately 40.5 kilometers (25 mi) by road south-west of the central business district of Kampala, the capital and largest city of Uganda. Its exact locational coordinates are 00°02′41″N 032°26′35″E”. Phase 1 activities include constructing a new cargo terminal, resurfacing the main runway with new lighting, constructing a new terminal building (that is adjacent and connected to the existing terminal and with aerobridges), repairing, strengthening and expanding the main apron serving the existing terminal and the new terminal, repairing the second runway and associated taxiways, repairing Apron 2 (which serves VVIPs or Very Very Important Persons), strengthening Apron 4 (which serves general aviation and cargo aircraft), replacing aging navigation aids, and constructing a multi-story car park. The total cost of Phase 1 is $200 million and the total cost of Phase 2 is $125 million. These two phases were originally expected to take 5 years to implement. It is expected that, upon completion, the expanded and upgraded airport will increase annual passenger output at the airport from 1.5 million to 3.5 million and freight volume of the completed freight center from 55,000 tons to 100,000 tons CCCC is the contractor responsible for project implementation. Dar Al-Handasah (Shair & Partners) is responsible for project supervision. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on August 29, 2015. Construction began on May 10, 2016. As of June 2019, the project had achieved a 52% completion rate. As of October 26, 2021, the Government of Uganda’s Aid Management Platform summarized the status of the project in the following manner: ‘Physical Progress: The overall performance of the civil works currently stands at 50%. One runway is complete; works on the runway apron are halfway and 80% of the works on the cargo building have been achieved. Challenges: Overdue IPC Payments which have led to accrual of interest charges e.g accrued interest for [Interim Payment Certificate]# 1 up to [Interim Payment Certificate] #23 as of July 11th 2019 stood at USD 951,368.49. This increases by the month. Progress of the Cargo Terminal and Airfield Works continues but require intense supervision to ensure acceptable workmanship and approved materials are employed. Some [overdue] approved materials for the Cargo Complex are not yet delivered to [the project site], meaning that delays encountered so far will not be recovered. The project still reports approximately Eleven Months delay and the Contractor [CCCC] is still reluctant to [reprogram its] work in accordance with Clause 8.3 of the General Conditions of Contract, to include measures intended to recover lost time. It is also evident that project completion cannot be achieved by May 2021. In addition, challenges for construction include coordination difficulties with the extensive fuel network (by Tristar) and with Airport Operations, Safety and Security, due to the naturally intrusive nature of construction within an operational environment. Runway 17/35 and Apron 1 Works are particularly noted in this respect.  By November 2021, the project had achieved an overall completion rate or 75.1%. Then, in March 2022, construction of the cargo terminal was completed. Li Qinpu, a project manager of the CCCC, said at the peak of the construction of the cargo terminal, the project employed 80 Chinese workers and more than 900 local workers at different skills levels. Phase 1 was originally expected to reach completion by May 9, 2021. However, this date was subsequently pushed out to December 5, 2022. The expected completion date of the project’s second phase (which had not yet secured financing as of March 2022) is March 2024. The Entebbe International Airport Upgrading and Expansion Project has become a source of local and international controversy. One set of concerns relate to the potentially inflated cost of the underlying commercial contract. CCCC (the EPC contractor) pre-financed the feasibility study for the design and implementation of project. The feasibility study report submitted to CAA in December 2013 costed Phase 1 of the project at $200,000,000, which paved the way for the signing of a $200,000,000 commercial contract between CAA and CCCC on October 2014. There was, however, no independent review of the feasibility estimates by UCAA during the procurement stage which would have informed the Government of Uganda on the reasonableness and accuracy of the cost estimates prior to agreeing to CCCC securing the funds from China Eximbank.   Additionally, the UCAA contracts committee approved the project cost in the feasibility study on September 23, 2014 without undertaking an independent evaluation of these costs. Another set of concerns relate to the collateralization arrangement that underpins the China Eximbank loan agreement and an Escrow Account Agreement in which UCAA reportedly granted China Eximbank approval authority over the Entebbe International Airport’s annual budgets and UCAA’s use of revenues from the airport in the escrow account. The loan agreement states that repayment of the China Eximbank loan is the responsibility of the “end user” (CAA) and the escrow account (established as a requirement of the loan agreement to facilitate repayment) should be funded using airport revenues. However, in January 2019, Uganda’s Auditor General revealed that the Government of Uganda’s Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development had made interest payments on the loan and but not deposited airport revenues in the escrow account. The Auditor General also noted that “inconsistencies in the operationalization of the agreements and the involved parties’ deemed actions represent non-compliance/ breach of contract that could result in penalties and even cancellation of the [loan] facility.” By March 2019, China Eximbank responded to the borrower’s non-compliance with escrow account conditions by halting loan disbursements, which in turn led to the Government of Uganda falling behind on payments to CCCC (the EPC contractor). This resulted in major construction delays. CCCC’s payment certificates 11-23 (worth $24.5 million) for work performed between December 2017 and February 2019 were not paid, which led to a project implementation standstill that lasted for 361 days. UCAA later told a parliamentary oversight body that “[t]hese [escrow account] conditions were not palatable for an international airport of a sovereign state whose operations are dynamic and sometimes unpredictable.” The Government of Uganda responded on March 6, 2019 by dispatching an 11-member delegation (consisting of CAA officials, Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development officials, the Deputy Solicitor General, and Uganda’s Ambassador to China, H.E. Dr. Crispus C.W. Kiyonga) to Beijing to renegotiate so-called ‘toxic clauses’ in the loan agreement with China Eximbank. According to an internal Government of Uganda record (a September 5, 2019 memo/letter from Finance Minister Matia Kasaija to Public Works Minister Monica Azuba Ntege), “[w]hile the initial agenda was to cause a re-negotiation of specific clauses in the original financing agreement that seemed very unsuitable to [the Government of Uganda] and therefore to the end user (UCAA), the [China Eximbank] officials made it clear from the onset that re-negotiation and amendment of the loan agreement were not agreeable to them. The Bank proposed, which the [Government of Uganda delegation] found plausible, that rather than having a re-negotiation, we could have a ‘clarification’ of the contentious clauses with a view of having a workable interpretation. It was the understanding of all parties that to achieve a win-win situation, the contentious clauses would be interpreted with a view of having a balanced effect that would enable resumption of disbursement without necessarily amending the agreement. The Bank’s view was that such an amendment if allowed would set a bad precedent and more so, they saw no cause to warrant the amendment.   In that regard, it was agreed that: i) The Bank resumes financing through disbursements and makes flexible the conditions set around the Escrow Account Agreement clauses especially the provision requiring UCAA to deposit all airport revenues [in] this account. The Bank clarified that the objective of the sales collection account was to see [UCAA’s] inflows and outflows for this account and that since the minimum reserve amount was already available on the debt reserve payment account, the funds would henceforth be available for [UCAA’s] operations. It was agreed that the Borrower [the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development] shares proof of the banking on the sales collection account as a trigger for the Bank to unlock disbursements. This has since been implemented. ii) Another contentious matter that the delegation wanted to be varied was the provision requiring UCAA to submit for approval all their operational budgets to [China Eximbank]. The Bank clarified that they were interested in the project budget but since this budget was subsumed in other UCAA operational activities, UCAA was henceforth required to share approved budgets with the Bank for review only and not for approval.” China Eximbank and the Government of Uganda delegation also reportedly agreed to keep the details of their meeting (‘minutes of the meeting’) confidential. Then, on December 20, 2019, Uganda’s Office of the Auditor General publish a report that criticized Uganda’s Ministry of Finance for the borrowing terms in the Entebbe airport loan agreement and several other loan agreements with China Eximbank: “A review of the various facility agreements for issued [China Eximbank] loans revealed that the [Government of Uganda] was obliged to open escrow accounts where the government was expected to make advance deposit of funds over the tenure of the loan required for the repayment of the loan. It was observed that some of the escrow bank accounts are held with local commercial banks while others are held in the Lenders countries. […] The funds are deposited on commercial bank accounts upfront and the creditors have access to them before even the loans are disbursed. Government of Uganda has no control over these accounts. The practice causes financial strain to the cash flows of the country and maybe as a result of weaknesses in negotiations that are undertaken by the government of Uganda and the lenders. These funds could have been used as advance to start the implementation of the projects for which the financing is required. The practice distorts the Government [of Uganda]s] cash flows and monetary control policy. The [Government of Uganda’s] Accounting Officer promised to improve on the way [the Government] negotiate[s] loans with escrow conditionalities. [Uganda’s Auditor General] advised the Accounting [Officer] to in future avoid loans with such unfavourable terms or negotiate to have such terms softened.”   Then, in October 2021, a parliamentary panel led by opposition politicians revealed that the Government of Uganda’s arrangement with China Eximbank requires that all of UCAA’s revenues and expenditures pass through accounts controlled by China Eximbank at a Kampala branch of South Africa’s Standard Bank Group Ltd. (Stanbic Bank), which is itself partly owned by Beijing’s biggest state-owned bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). Members of Parliament’s Committee on Commissions, Statutory Authorities and State Enterprise (Cosase) raised questions and concerns about the wisdom of granting financial oversight power (and influence over which creditors get paid first) — normally reserved for the country’s treasury and parliament — to a Chinese state-owned bank. They also questioned the wisdom of the Ugandan Government limiting its own ability to tap into revenue from rapidly expanding tourism and exports. [Note: Entebbe International Airport is a regional hub airport. Traffic has soared over the past decade and is expected to grow more amid a $15 billion crude-oil development project along Uganda’s border with the Democratic Republic of Congo.] Joel Ssenyonyi, a member of parliament who led the panel, said “It’s appalling. […] that [China Eximbank] now has to approve any budget spending [of UCAA].” On October 28, 2021, Uganda's Finance Minister Matia Kasaija was called before the parliamentary panel and questioned over the terms of the loan. He apologized to the lawmakers, noting that “we shouldn’t have accepted some of the clauses. [...] But they told you . . . either you take it or leave it.” He also said the loan would be repaid and there was no chance that the airport would be seized by the lender. Then, on November 25, 2021, a local newspaper in Uganda (The Daily Monitor) published a report, which suggested that the China Eximbank loan agreement “if not amended, [could] expose Uganda's sovereign assets to attachments and take-over upon arbitration awards in Beijing.” Two days later, on November 27, 2021, UCAA Spokesperson Vianney M Luggya tweeted that “It is true that @UgandaCAA opened up a Sales Collection Account in @stanbicug where all the [UCAA’s] revenues are deposited in line with the Escrow Account Agreement terms, but it does not mean that anyone is to control our finances.” Luggya also tweeted that “The [UCAA] enjoys the freedom & liberty of spending what is collected (as per the budget). The lender’s monitoring of the account is only similar to what happens when one gets a salary loan or any other loan, & the bank requests that the salary is channeled through their bank. It does not mean that lending bank takes over your salary.” In late 2021, internal disagreements within the executive branch of the Ugandan Government also spilled into public view. Uganda's Finance Minister Matia Kasaija reportedly advocated for adherence to the agreement that the Government of Uganda struck with China Eximbank in March 2019 (as codified in the ‘minutes of the meeting’). However, UCAA and the Ministry of Public Works reportedly treated Kasaija’s position ‘with disdain for allegedly blind-spotting a deal that presents real risks to Uganda's sovereign assets.’ UCAA officials reportedly flagged up to 13 clauses in the China Eximbank agreement as ""unfair” or a threat to “the sovereignty of Uganda.” A confidential source told the a local newspaper in Uganda that “it’s clear that [U]CAA will lose its rights of use and control over its revenues […] as a self-financing institution with limited funding. Such provisions would expose the [organization] to risk of failure in service delivery and bankruptcy.” In June 2020, David Kakuba, who was the Director General of UCAA at that time, warned that granting China Eximbank approval authority over UCAA’s budgeting and planning decisions “exposes UCAA to risk of failure to deliver its mandate, and infringes on State's effective control over UCAA.” After Kakuba’s retirement, the Acting UCAA Director General Fred Bamwesigye wrote to Works Minister Gen Edward Katumba Wamala on September 8, 2021 and reminded him of the importance of renegotiating the loan agreement with China Eximbank. He also asked him to remind Minister of Finance Matia Kasaija to notify China Eximbank of the need to amend the agreement to make it consistent with Ugandan law and international law. He wrote that “whereas some of the provisions referred to were alluded to in the Minutes of the Negotiations, the unfair clauses remain embedded in the agreements, while in some cases, they were not dealt with at all. […] There is, therefore, an urgent need to start the review and renegotiation of the Government Concession Loan Agreement... in order to reduce the intentions of the parties into a legally-binding agreement.” Then, on December 11, 2019, David Kakuba warned Minister of Finance Matia Kasaija that “any seeming delay or any form of understanding that is not reduced into an amended agreement of the signed ones, would maintain the enforceability by [China Eximbank] of the disputed agreement.” He also noted that Section 10.3 of the Repayment Mechanism Agreement provides for a waiver of immunity and states that ‘each obligor hereby irrevocably waives any immunity on grounds of sovereign or other immunity for itself or any of its property in connection with any arbitration proceeding or with enforcement of any arbitral awards any court judgement.' Such a provision, if not amended, David Kakuba argues ""exposes government assets to attachments and take-over upon arbitration awards in China.” Around the same time, Uganda’s Ministry of Public Works reportedly asked the Ministry of Finance to seek a speedy revision and resolution of the ‘problematic clauses’ in the China Eximbank loan agreement. However, in December 2021, Bloomberg reported that “Uganda’s chief legal officer urged the Finance Ministry to refrain from renegotiating the terms of [the China Eximbank loan agreement] as it is able to meet its debt obligations.”","1.

The collateralization arrangement that governs the PBC is described in detail in Article 6.12 of the PBC agreement. The PBC agreement defines the ‘security document’ as ‘each of the agreements and legal documents signed by the relevant parties for the purposes of creating security interests in favor of the Lender and enhancing the credit of the Borrower as stipulated in Article 6.12, including without limitation the On-lending Agreement(s), the Repayment Mechanism Agreement and the Escrow Account Agreement.’ Article 6.12 reads as follows: ‘The borrower undertakes that a Repayment Mechanism will be established for the Project and the repayment of principal and payment of interest and fees under this Agreement shall be credit enhanced and secured by the Repayment Mechanism Agreement, Escrow Account Agreement and the following arrangements: (1) After this Agreement has been signed by the Borrower and the Lender, the On-Lending Agreement shall be duly signed by the Borrower and End-User [UCAA], in form and substance acceptable to the Lender. (2) The Repayment Reserve Account and the Sales Collection Account shall be opened and maintained with the Escrow Account Bank and be subject to the escrow arrangement under the the Escrow Account Agreement. The Repayment Reserve Account shall be used to maintain the minimum amount of balance as a debt service reserve as required by the Lender and the Lender shall be entitled to utilized the funds in the Repayment Reserve Account. The Sales Collection Account shall be used to collect the revenues of Entebbe International Airport (including but not limited to revenues generated from the Project) and the required amount of funds in the Sales Collection Account shall be transferred to the Repayment Reserve Account as required by the Lender. (3) All the revenues (proceeds) of Entebbe International Airport (including but not limited to revenues generated from the Project) shall be applied in priority to payment of any and all amounts due and payable under this Agreement. (4) The Borrower undertakes to ensure that the successors or permitted assignees and transferee of the parties of the Security Documents shall abide by the provisions of the relevant Security Documents. (5) Notwithstanding the existence of the Security Document, the Borrower shall be fully liable for the payment and repayment obligations under this Agreement. The Borrower’s obligations under this Agreement shall not be affected or undermined by the execution, delivery and performance by the relevant parties of such Security Documents.’ The PBC defines the ‘End-User’ as ‘the Civil Aviation Authority of the Republic of Uganda.’ The PBC defines ‘Escrow Accounts’ as ‘each or both (as the context may require) of the Repayment Reserve Account and the Sales Collection Account.’ The PBC defines the ‘Escrow Account Agreement’ as the ‘escrow account agreement entered into to or to be entered into among the Lender, the Borrower, the End-User and the Escrow Account Bank, and other relevant parties, as agreed by the Borrower and the Lender, in respect of opening, maintenance and control of the Escrow Accounts and in form and substance acceptable to the Lender. The PBC defines the ‘Escrow Account Bank’ as the ‘Export-Import Bank of China and/or such other reputable international bank registered in Uganda and acceptable to the lender.’ The PBC defines the ‘On-Lending Agreement(s)’ as the ‘loan agreement entered into between the Borrower and the End-User, whereby the Facility is on-lent by the Borrower to the End-User to implement the Project.’ The PBC defines the ‘Repayment Reserve Account’ as ‘the account in the name of the Borrower with the Escrow Account Bank and for the purpose of maintaining the minimum amount of the funds as debt service reserve pursuant to the Escrow Account Agreement.’ The PBC defines the ‘Repayment Mechanism Agreement’ as ‘the repayment mechanism agreement entered into or to be entered into among the Lender, the Borrower, the End-User n form and substance acceptable to the Lender, under which the parties agree to, among others, enter into (or procure the relevant parties to enter into) the Escrow Account Agreement and ensure all revenues of Entebbe International Airport (including but not limited to the revenues generated from the Project) shall be paid into the Sales Collection Account.’ The PBC defines the ‘Sales Collection Account’ as ‘the account in the name of End-User with the Escrow Account Bank and for the purpose of collecting revenues of Entebbe International Airport (including but not limited to revenues generated from the Project) pursuant to the Escrow Account Agreement.’ 3. The revenues generated by this project flow through a ‘cashflow waterfall’ arrangement (usefully described via https://pivotal180.com/project-finance-cash-flow-waterfall/ and https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=26f2629e-2040-4dda-a6d8-6600e478cf7f). 4.

This agreement has several important terms, definitions, clauses, and conditions that merit attention:(i) ‘Airport Revenues’ are defined as ‘all the revenues, proceeds, incomes and any other amounts of whatever nature (whether directly or indirectly) generated from or relating to operation of the Entebbe International Airport by the End-Users from the date of a written notice issued by the Lender under Clause 16 herein, including but not limited to all revenues generated from the Project.’(ii) The agreement identifies two different escrow accounts: the Sales Collection Account and the Repayment Reserve Account. The Sales Collection Account is defined as ‘a Uganda Shillings denominated account of End-user [UCAA] for the purpose of collecting Airport Revenues’. The Repayment Reserve Account is defined as ‘a Dollar denominated account of the Borrower on which the Minimum Reserve Amount must be maintained’.(iii) The agreement specifies that ‘(a) The End-user shall prepare, and provide to the Borrower and the Lender, budget of operation, maintenance and other expenditures prior to last week of December every year for the next calendar year. Such budget shall be subject to the Borrower and the Lender’s review and approval. Such budget shall be prepared in a form that has been previously approved by the Borrower and the Lender. It shall record the project operating amount for each calendar month (Monthly Figure) and the aggregate amount of the budget for the whole calendar year (Aggregate Yearly Figure). The End-user shall provide the first such budget within sixty (60) days after the date of the first Disbursement under the Loan Agreement, (b) The Lender (acting reasonably) has the right to approve or reject some or all of such pro forma budget provided that if the Lender rejects part or all of such budget, it shall within thirty (30) days given reasons for such rejection.

If there is a conflict between the notice provided by the End-user and the notice provided by the Lender, the Lender’s notice shall prevail. […] The End-user shall prepare, and provide to the Borrower and the Escrow Account Bank, a monthly operating budget prior to the 28th day of each month for the next calendar month. The monthly operating budget shall be prepared in accordance with a form previously approved by the Borrower and the Lender.

# Title
China Eximbank provides RMB 1.26 billion loan for Phase 1 of Entebbe International Airport Upgrading and Expansion Project

# Description
On March 31, 2015, the Chinese Government and the Government of Uganda signed a preferential loan framework agreement for Phase 1 of the Entebbe International Airport Upgrading and Expansion Project. On the same day, China Eximbank and the Government of Uganda signed an RMB 1,260,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) loan agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2015) 6 TOTAL NO. (545)] for Phase 1 of the Entebbe International Airport Upgrading and Expansion Project.  Uganda’s Parliament then ratified the loan agreement on July 29, 2015. Several months later, on November 17, 2015, the Government of Uganda entered into a subsidiary, on-lending agreement with Uganda Civil Aviation Authority (UCAA). The borrowing terms of the GCL are as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.25% (RMB 3,150,000) management fee, and a 0.25% commitment fee. The first scheduled loan repayment date is April 1, 2022.   The GCL is secured by (collateralized against) airport revenues deposited in a lender-controlled bank account with a minimum cash balance requirement. A December 3, 2015 escrow account agreement between the Government of Uganda's Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development, Stanbic Bank Uganda Limited, UCAA, and China Eximbank specifies that the borrower must maintain a minimum cash balance in the repayment reserve account of RMB 25,200,000 during the loan’s grace period (equivalent to total payable interest for one year during the loan’s grace period) and RMB 98,870,000 during the loan’s repayment period (equivalent to total payable principal and interest for one year during the loan’s repayment period). The GCL agreement also specifies that the 'all the revenues (proceeds) of Entebbe International Airport (including but not limited to revenues generated from the Project) shall be applied in priority to payment of any and all amounts due and payable [to the lender].' Under the terms of an Escrow Account Agreement, UCAA also agreed to (a) seek secure advance approval from China Eximbank for any use of the airport revenues that it deposits in the escrow account; and (b) grant China Eximbank approval authority over the airport’s annual budgets.   The ultimate borrower/end-user (UCAA) is expected to use the GCL proceeds to finance a $200,000,000 commercial (EPC) contract between UCAA and China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), which was signed on October 8, 2014 and amended on January 12, 2015.   According to the Government of Uganda’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), this loan achieved a 78% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 26 loan disbursements (worth $156,639,169.44) between 2015 and 2021: a $60,124,334.71 disbursement on December 24, 2015, a $9,822,292.39 disbursement on November 15, 2016, a $4,473,339.53 disbursement on December 14, 2016, a $5,272,753.02 disbursement on March 29, 2017, a $2,363,019.84 disbursement on April 20, 2017, a $1,336,370.91 disbursement on May 25, 2017, a $1,237,900.78 disbursement on August 10, 2017, a $5,492,164.36 disbursement on November 21, 2017, a $3,445,536.22 disbursement on December 27, 2017, a $21,668,252.97 disbursement on April 19, 2019, a $3,032,693.76 disbursement on May 30, 2019, a $3,743,156.53 disbursement on August 22, 2019, a $3,074,851.76 disbursement on October 31, 2019, a $2,911,749.34 disbursement on November 25, 2019, a $2,683,403.29 disbursement on March 31, 2020, a $1,275,590.33 disbursement on April 27, 2020, a $3,197,241.55 disbursement on May 27, 2020, a $1,758,890.15 disbursement on July 24, 2020, a $1,831,735.75 disbursement on August 7, 2020, a $1,944,401.91 disbursement on September 28, 2020, a $3,835,965.97 disbursement on December 18, 2020, a $4,414,162.60 disbursement on November 24, 2021, a $3,128,465.91 disbursement on March 30, 2022, a $2,110,577.92 disbursement on August 17, 2022, a $1,314,054.62 disbursement on November 17, 2022, and a $1,146,263.31 disbursement on December 13, 2022.  According to the Uganda Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development's Report on Public Debt, Grants, Guarantees and Other Financial Liabilities for Financial Year 2021/2022, as of December 31, 2021, total loan disbursements amounted to $155,982,698.23 and the loan’s amount outstanding (including arrears) was $155,982,698.23.   The purpose of the project’s first phase is to upgrade and expand Entebbe International Airport. The airport is located at 5 minutes from the main campus of Kampala International University, near the town of Entebbe, on the shores of Lake Victoria, and approximately 40.5 kilometers (25 mi) by road south-west of the central business district of Kampala, the capital and largest city of Uganda. Its exact locational coordinates are 00°02′41″N 032°26′35″E”. Phase 1 activities include constructing a new cargo terminal, resurfacing the main runway with new lighting, constructing a new terminal building (that is adjacent and connected to the existing terminal and with aerobridges), repairing, strengthening and expanding the main apron serving the existing terminal and the new terminal, repairing the second runway and associated taxiways, repairing Apron 2 (which serves VVIPs or Very Very Important Persons), strengthening Apron 4 (which serves general aviation and cargo aircraft), replacing aging navigation aids, and constructing a multi-story car park. The total cost of Phase 1 is $200 million and the total cost of Phase 2 is $125 million. These two phases were originally expected to take 5 years to implement. It is expected that, upon completion, the expanded and upgraded airport will increase annual passenger output at the airport from 1.5 million to 3.5 million and freight volume of the completed freight center from 55,000 tons to 100,000 tons CCCC is the contractor responsible for project implementation. Dar Al-Handasah (Shair & Partners) is responsible for project supervision. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on August 29, 2015. Construction began on May 10, 2016. As of June 2019, the project had achieved a 52% completion rate. As of October 26, 2021, the Government of Uganda’s Aid Management Platform summarized the status of the project in the following manner: ‘Physical Progress: The overall performance of the civil works currently stands at 50%. One runway is complete; works on the runway apron are halfway and 80% of the works on the cargo building have been achieved. Challenges: Overdue IPC Payments which have led to accrual of interest charges e.g accrued interest for [Interim Payment Certificate]# 1 up to [Interim Payment Certificate] #23 as of July 11th 2019 stood at USD 951,368.49. This increases by the month. Progress of the Cargo Terminal and Airfield Works continues but require intense supervision to ensure acceptable workmanship and approved materials are employed. Some [overdue] approved materials for the Cargo Complex are not yet delivered to [the project site], meaning that delays encountered so far will not be recovered. The project still reports approximately Eleven Months delay and the Contractor [CCCC] is still reluctant to [reprogram its] work in accordance with Clause 8.3 of the General Conditions of Contract, to include measures intended to recover lost time. It is also evident that project completion cannot be achieved by May 2021. In addition, challenges for construction include coordination difficulties with the extensive fuel network (by Tristar) and with Airport Operations, Safety and Security, due to the naturally intrusive nature of construction within an operational environment. Runway 17/35 and Apron 1 Works are particularly noted in this respect.  By November 2021, the project had achieved an overall completion rate or 75.1%. Then, in March 2022, construction of the cargo terminal was completed. Li Qinpu, a project manager of the CCCC, said at the peak of the construction of the cargo terminal, the project employed 80 Chinese workers and more than 900 local workers at different skills levels. Phase 1 was originally expected to reach completion by May 9, 2021. However, this date was subsequently pushed out to December 5, 2022. The expected completion date of the project’s second phase (which had not yet secured financing as of March 2022) is March 2024. The Entebbe International Airport Upgrading and Expansion Project has become a source of local and international controversy. One set of concerns relate to the potentially inflated cost of the underlying commercial contract. CCCC (the EPC contractor) pre-financed the feasibility study for the design and implementation of project. The feasibility study report submitted to CAA in December 2013 costed Phase 1 of the project at $200,000,000, which paved the way for the signing of a $200,000,000 commercial contract between CAA and CCCC on October 2014. There was, however, no independent review of the feasibility estimates by UCAA during the procurement stage which would have informed the Government of Uganda on the reasonableness and accuracy of the cost estimates prior to agreeing to CCCC securing the funds from China Eximbank.   Additionally, the UCAA contracts committee approved the project cost in the feasibility study on September 23, 2014 without undertaking an independent evaluation of these costs. Another set of concerns relate to the collateralization arrangement that underpins the China Eximbank loan agreement and an Escrow Account Agreement in which UCAA reportedly granted China Eximbank approval authority over the Entebbe International Airport’s annual budgets and UCAA’s use of revenues from the airport in the escrow account. The loan agreement states that repayment of the China Eximbank loan is the responsibility of the “end user” (CAA) and the escrow account (established as a requirement of the loan agreement to facilitate repayment) should be funded using airport revenues. However, in January 2019, Uganda’s Auditor General revealed that the Government of Uganda’s Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development had made interest payments on the loan and but not deposited airport revenues in the escrow account. The Auditor General also noted that “inconsistencies in the operationalization of the agreements and the involved parties’ deemed actions represent non-compliance/ breach of contract that could result in penalties and even cancellation of the [loan] facility.” By March 2019, China Eximbank responded to the borrower’s non-compliance with escrow account conditions by halting loan disbursements, which in turn led to the Government of Uganda falling behind on payments to CCCC (the EPC contractor). This resulted in major construction delays. CCCC’s payment certificates 11-23 (worth $24.5 million) for work performed between December 2017 and February 2019 were not paid, which led to a project implementation standstill that lasted for 361 days. UCAA later told a parliamentary oversight body that “[t]hese [escrow account] conditions were not palatable for an international airport of a sovereign state whose operations are dynamic and sometimes unpredictable.” The Government of Uganda responded on March 6, 2019 by dispatching an 11-member delegation (consisting of CAA officials, Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development officials, the Deputy Solicitor General, and Uganda’s Ambassador to China, H.E. Dr. Crispus C.W. Kiyonga) to Beijing to renegotiate so-called ‘toxic clauses’ in the loan agreement with China Eximbank. According to an internal Government of Uganda record (a September 5, 2019 memo/letter from Finance Minister Matia Kasaija to Public Works Minister Monica Azuba Ntege), “[w]hile the initial agenda was to cause a re-negotiation of specific clauses in the original financing agreement that seemed very unsuitable to [the Government of Uganda] and therefore to the end user (UCAA), the [China Eximbank] officials made it clear from the onset that re-negotiation and amendment of the loan agreement were not agreeable to them. The Bank proposed, which the [Government of Uganda delegation] found plausible, that rather than having a re-negotiation, we could have a ‘clarification’ of the contentious clauses with a view of having a workable interpretation. It was the understanding of all parties that to achieve a win-win situation, the contentious clauses would be interpreted with a view of having a balanced effect that would enable resumption of disbursement without necessarily amending the agreement. The Bank’s view was that such an amendment if allowed would set a bad precedent and more so, they saw no cause to warrant the amendment.   In that regard, it was agreed that: i) The Bank resumes financing through disbursements and makes flexible the conditions set around the Escrow Account Agreement clauses especially the provision requiring UCAA to deposit all airport revenues [in] this account. The Bank clarified that the objective of the sales collection account was to see [UCAA’s] inflows and outflows for this account and that since the minimum reserve amount was already available on the debt reserve payment account, the funds would henceforth be available for [UCAA’s] operations. It was agreed that the Borrower [the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development] shares proof of the banking on the sales collection account as a trigger for the Bank to unlock disbursements. This has since been implemented. ii) Another contentious matter that the delegation wanted to be varied was the provision requiring UCAA to submit for approval all their operational budgets to [China Eximbank]. The Bank clarified that they were interested in the project budget but since this budget was subsumed in other UCAA operational activities, UCAA was henceforth required to share approved budgets with the Bank for review only and not for approval.” China Eximbank and the Government of Uganda delegation also reportedly agreed to keep the details of their meeting (‘minutes of the meeting’) confidential. Then, on December 20, 2019, Uganda’s Office of the Auditor General publish a report that criticized Uganda’s Ministry of Finance for the borrowing terms in the Entebbe airport loan agreement and several other loan agreements with China Eximbank: “A review of the various facility agreements for issued [China Eximbank] loans revealed that the [Government of Uganda] was obliged to open escrow accounts where the government was expected to make advance deposit of funds over the tenure of the loan required for the repayment of the loan. It was observed that some of the escrow bank accounts are held with local commercial banks while others are held in the Lenders countries. […] The funds are deposited on commercial bank accounts upfront and the creditors have access to them before even the loans are disbursed. Government of Uganda has no control over these accounts. The practice causes financial strain to the cash flows of the country and maybe as a result of weaknesses in negotiations that are undertaken by the government of Uganda and the lenders. These funds could have been used as advance to start the implementation of the projects for which the financing is required. The practice distorts the Government [of Uganda]s] cash flows and monetary control policy. The [Government of Uganda’s] Accounting Officer promised to improve on the way [the Government] negotiate[s] loans with escrow conditionalities. [Uganda’s Auditor General] advised the Accounting [Officer] to in future avoid loans with such unfavourable terms or negotiate to have such terms softened.”   Then, in October 2021, a parliamentary panel led by opposition politicians revealed that the Government of Uganda’s arrangement with China Eximbank requires that all of UCAA’s revenues and expenditures pass through accounts controlled by China Eximbank at a Kampala branch of South Africa’s Standard Bank Group Ltd. (Stanbic Bank), which is itself partly owned by Beijing’s biggest state-owned bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). Members of Parliament’s Committee on Commissions, Statutory Authorities and State Enterprise (Cosase) raised questions and concerns about the wisdom of granting financial oversight power (and influence over which creditors get paid first) — normally reserved for the country’s treasury and parliament — to a Chinese state-owned bank. They also questioned the wisdom of the Ugandan Government limiting its own ability to tap into revenue from rapidly expanding tourism and exports. [Note: Entebbe International Airport is a regional hub airport. Traffic has soared over the past decade and is expected to grow more amid a $15 billion crude-oil development project along Uganda’s border with the Democratic Republic of Congo.] Joel Ssenyonyi, a member of parliament who led the panel, said “It’s appalling. […] that [China Eximbank] now has to approve any budget spending [of UCAA].” On October 28, 2021, Uganda's Finance Minister Matia Kasaija was called before the parliamentary panel and questioned over the terms of the loan. He apologized to the lawmakers, noting that “we shouldn’t have accepted some of the clauses. [...] But they told you . . . either you take it or leave it.” He also said the loan would be repaid and there was no chance that the airport would be seized by the lender. Then, on November 25, 2021, a local newspaper in Uganda (The Daily Monitor) published a report, which suggested that the China Eximbank loan agreement “if not amended, [could] expose Uganda's sovereign assets to attachments and take-over upon arbitration awards in Beijing.” Two days later, on November 27, 2021, UCAA Spokesperson Vianney M Luggya tweeted that “It is true that @UgandaCAA opened up a Sales Collection Account in @stanbicug where all the [UCAA’s] revenues are deposited in line with the Escrow Account Agreement terms, but it does not mean that anyone is to control our finances.” Luggya also tweeted that “The [UCAA] enjoys the freedom & liberty of spending what is collected (as per the budget). The lender’s monitoring of the account is only similar to what happens when one gets a salary loan or any other loan, & the bank requests that the salary is channeled through their bank. It does not mean that lending bank takes over your salary.” In late 2021, internal disagreements within the executive branch of the Ugandan Government also spilled into public view. Uganda's Finance Minister Matia Kasaija reportedly advocated for adherence to the agreement that the Government of Uganda struck with China Eximbank in March 2019 (as codified in the ‘minutes of the meeting’). However, UCAA and the Ministry of Public Works reportedly treated Kasaija’s position ‘with disdain for allegedly blind-spotting a deal that presents real risks to Uganda's sovereign assets.’ UCAA officials reportedly flagged up to 13 clauses in the China Eximbank agreement as ""unfair” or a threat to “the sovereignty of Uganda.” A confidential source told the a local newspaper in Uganda that “it’s clear that [U]CAA will lose its rights of use and control over its revenues […] as a self-financing institution with limited funding. Such provisions would expose the [organization] to risk of failure in service delivery and bankruptcy.” In June 2020, David Kakuba, who was the Director General of UCAA at that time, warned that granting China Eximbank approval authority over UCAA’s budgeting and planning decisions “exposes UCAA to risk of failure to deliver its mandate, and infringes on State's effective control over UCAA.” After Kakuba’s retirement, the Acting UCAA Director General Fred Bamwesigye wrote to Works Minister Gen Edward Katumba Wamala on September 8, 2021 and reminded him of the importance of renegotiating the loan agreement with China Eximbank. He also asked him to remind Minister of Finance Matia Kasaija to notify China Eximbank of the need to amend the agreement to make it consistent with Ugandan law and international law. He wrote that “whereas some of the provisions referred to were alluded to in the Minutes of the Negotiations, the unfair clauses remain embedded in the agreements, while in some cases, they were not dealt with at all. […] There is, therefore, an urgent need to start the review and renegotiation of the Government Concession Loan Agreement... in order to reduce the intentions of the parties into a legally-binding agreement.” Then, on December 11, 2019, David Kakuba warned Minister of Finance Matia Kasaija that “any seeming delay or any form of understanding that is not reduced into an amended agreement of the signed ones, would maintain the enforceability by [China Eximbank] of the disputed agreement.” He also noted that Section 10.3 of the Repayment Mechanism Agreement provides for a waiver of immunity and states that ‘each obligor hereby irrevocably waives any immunity on grounds of sovereign or other immunity for itself or any of its property in connection with any arbitration proceeding or with enforcement of any arbitral awards any court judgement.' Such a provision, if not amended, David Kakuba argues ""exposes government assets to attachments and take-over upon arbitration awards in China.” Around the same time, Uganda’s Ministry of Public Works reportedly asked the Ministry of Finance to seek a speedy revision and resolution of the ‘problematic clauses’ in the China Eximbank loan agreement. However, in December 2021, Bloomberg reported that “Uganda’s chief legal officer urged the Finance Ministry to refrain from renegotiating the terms of [the China Eximbank loan agreement] as it is able to meet its debt obligations.”",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,General Infrastructure,"The project focuses on upgrading and expanding an international airport, which is general infrastructure with no direct environmental or energy transition impact.","Construction of new cargo terminal, terminal building, runway resurfacing, and other airport infrastructure improvements without specific energy transition or environmental focus"

60236,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",ICBC provides $240 million loan for Sukulu Phosphate Comprehensive Industrial Development Project (Linked to Project ID#31123),"On August 1, 2013, the Government of Uganda granted an exploration license to Guangzhou Dong Song Energy Group (U) Co., Limited to develop the phosphates and rare earth minerals at Sukulu. Then, on December 4, 2015, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) signed a $240 million loan agreement (project financing facility agreement) with Guangzhou Dong Song Energy Group (U) Co., Limited for the Sukulu Phosphate Comprehensive Industrial Development Project. Sinosure provided credit insurance for the loan. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance a commercial contract with the 23rd Metallurgical Construction Group Company Limited. The project involved the construction of a phosphate fertilizer production plant. It was part of a larger $620 million investment in the Osukuru industrial complex that was expected to include a steel manufacturing factory, a sulphuric acid manufacturing factory, (a rare earth minerals mining plant), the Osukuru Thermal Power Station (with capacity generation of 12 megawatts), and the largest organic fertilizer factory in East Africa (with capacity of 300,000 metric tonnes of organic fertilizer annually). The project site is located in Sukulu village in Eastern Uganda’s Tororo District. It is about 11 km outside Tororo town -- 5 km along the Busia-Tororo road -- near the Uganda-Kenya border. 23rd Metallurgical Construction Group Company Limited was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Project implementation commenced on October 16, 2015 and the phosphate fertilizer production plant was officially commissioned/completed on October 24, 2018. After the plant’s commissioning, it produced 50,000 tons of bio-organic fertilizer, which was distributed to tea, sugarcane and other commercial farms, for one planting season to test its effectiveness. The trial test was successful and commercial fertilizer production was expected to commence in January 2020. However, commercial fertilizer production was halted because of a legal dispute (due to alleged fraudulent acquisition and ownership of a multi-million dollar mineral deposit that led to the cancellation of Guangzhou Dong Song Energy Group (U) Co., Limited’s mining lease). Guangzhou Dong Song Energy Group (U) Co., Limited originally expected to commission a steel plant, sheet glass factory and slag cement plant in June 2019, but ICBC withheld loan disbursements because of legal challenges facing the company. ICBC also notified Guangzhou Dong Song Energy Group (U) Co., Limited in 2019 that it was withholding $60 million, at least part of which was the undisbursed balance of the $240 million loan, due to the introduction of a new policy that required ICBC to lower its overseas loan centralization ratio. The COVID-19 pandemic also affected project implementation, as many staff were either laid off or unable to return to the project site. The Sukulu Phosphate Comprehensive Industrial Development Project was also plagued by corruption. In April 2019, two former senior officials at Uganda’s Ministry of Finance who had previously been arrested for soliciting a bribe a Chinese investors were sentenced to two years in prison. The Anti-Corruption Court at Kololo also banned the two officers who were interdicted in 2017, from holding any public office for 10 years. Presiding Judge Lawrence Gidudu convicted former principal finance officer, John Ogol Charles Ogol and Geoffrey Turyamuhika alias Tumwine (senior economist) for receiving and accepting a $50,000 bribe from Hassan Sserunjogi on March 27, 2017. According to evidence in court, the convicted persons received the money in exchange for expediting documentation for financing the construction of a power substation and transmission line at the Sukulu Phosphate Comprehensive Industrial Development Project in Tororo. In addition to the jail punishment, Justice Gidudu ordered Ogol and Turyamuhika to pay a fine of Shs 4.8 million each. Then, in September 2022, President Museveni lamented the fact that Ugandan Ministry of Finance officials had cheated the project owner.

89456,BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES,NBU makes RMB 5.1 billion drawdown under currency swap agreement with PBOC in 2015,"On May 15, 2015, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) signed an RMB 15 billion (UAH 54 billion), three-year bilateral currency swap agreement to facilitate trade and improve foreign currency liquidity in Ukraine. The agreement entered into force on June 23, 2015. Then, according to the NBU, it made one or more (gross) drawdowns under the currency swap agreement equivalent to approximately RMB 5,180,694,107 during calendar year 2015. The borrowing carried a 1-year maturity length and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unknown margin. According to the IMF, the NBU activated its PBOC currency swap in order to address a shortfall in foreign exchange reserves that resulted from ‘lower export receipts in the second half of 2015 and delays in the disbursement in official financing.’","1. A bilateral currency swap (BCS) agreement — also known as a central bank liquidity swap agreement — is an agreement between the central banks of two countries to exchange cash flows in different currencies at predetermined rates over a specified period of time. Central banks participate in these agreements to facilitate bilateral trade settlements using their national currencies (rather than relying upon on a third-party currency such as the U.S. dollar), manage demands from their local banks, and provide liquidity support to financial markets. The party that draws down on the swap line becomes the borrower and the other party becomes lender. During the term of the swap, the party that draws down on the swap line makes either fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amount. If both parties draw down on the swap line, then both parties exchange fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amounts.  The 5-step process of drawing upon a currency swap line with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) can described from the perspective of an importer in a given country (‘Country X’) seeking to settle trade with a Chinese firm in RMB. Step 1: The central bank of Country X and the PBOC activate their currency swap in advance, at which point each party deposits a specific amount of its currency in an account controlled by the other party (i.e. the central bank of Country X deposits local currency in an account controlled by the PBOC, and the PBOC deposits an equivalent amount in RMB in an account controlled by the central bank of Country X). Step 2: A firm in Country X that imports goods from China applies for an RMB-denominated loan from a domestic bank. Step 3: The domestic bank in Country X that receives the loan application then applies to its central bank for an RMB-denominated loan. After a review process, the central bank of Country X notifies the domestic bank applicant that its loan application was approved. The central bank of Country X subsequently requests that the PBOC transfer RMB funds from the central bank of Country X’s swap account within the PBOC to the loan applicant’s account with a corresponding bank in China. Step 4:  The domestic bank in Country X directs the corresponding bank in China to transfer RMB funds into a Chinese exporter’s account, and the corresponding bank in China provides RMB funds to the Chinese exporter. Step 5: The importer in Country X repays the RMB-denominated loan at its maturity date. The domestic bank notifies the central bank of Country X of the repayment, and transfers RMB into the central bank’s account within the PBOC through the corresponding bank in China. For the central bank of Country X, the RMB deposit is an asset that should be recorded on its balance sheet as an official reserve asset denominated in RMB. The contra entry of this asset is the liability in the local currency of Country X that represents China’s claims in the central bank of Country X. This should be also recorded on the balance sheet of the central bank of Country X. At the time of the exchange of currencies, it should be recorded as an increase in assets and an increase in liabilities of the monetary authorities in the balance of payments. The reason why the PBOC uses this mechanism to provide renminbi liquidity to other central bank is to increase the speed, convenience, and volume of transactions between the two countries. More detailed information about currency swaps with the PBOC can be found at https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021210-print-pdf.ashx and https://thechinaguys.com/the-rise-of-the-renminbi-the-reality-of-bilateral-swap-agreements/ and https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2017/pdf/17-25a.pdf. 2. AidData treats drawdowns under BCS agreements with the PBOC as collateralized loans because, in a BCS arrangement, the currency of the borrower is held as collateral while the lender receives interest on the amount drawn down by the borrower until repayment is made. 3. NBU’s 2015 Annual Report reports joint drawdowns from swap lines by China and Sweden. Note 30 presents a 'geographic' risk analysis of borrowing. It shows that UAH 12,003 million was received from an OECD country (Sweden). UAH 19,280 million was received from an non-OECD country (China). This is also confirmed in note 31, which has a currency breakdown (the swap line with Sweden is USD denominated), so China (PBOC) accounts for the entire 'other currency' category.4.  Most central banks publish their end-of-year outstanding PBOC swap debt, but only a few report detailed transaction-level data on drawdowns during the year. Therefore, if no information on drawings is available, AidData assumes that total drawdowns during the reporting period equal the amount outstanding at the end of the reporting period (and vice versa). Since the (de jure) maturities of PBOC swap drawings are 12 months or less, this creates a lower bound estimate for actual drawdowns under the PBOC swap line. 5. PBOC swap debt is frequently rolled over. In central bank reports where one can only observe the year-end outstanding amount, no distinction between rollovers and drawdowns is possible. In these cases, one can derive (new) drawdowns as the difference between the current and last year’s outstanding swap debt stock. This measure essentially captures net lending through the PBOC swap line","# Sector

66480,COMMUNICATIONS,CDB provides $50 million loan to Ukrtelecom to modernize its technological infrastructure,"In July 2015, China Development Bank (CDB) and Ukrtelecom JSC (also known as Ukrtelecom, Укртелеком, or PFTS: UTLM) signed a $50 million loan agreement to modernize Ukrtelecom’s technological infrastructure. The loan has no grace period, a maturity period of 7 years, and an interest rate of 9.34%. Ukrtelecom pledged some of its properties as collateral for the loan. The proceeds of the loan were used by the borrower to finance a contract with Huawei Technologies Ltd. As of December 31, 2018, the undrawn balance under the CDB loan amounted to $18,489,000.   The purpose of the project (supported by the CDB loan) was to modernize Ukrtelecom’s technological infrastructure in the six largest cities of Ukraine (Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Dnipro, Donetsk, and Zaporizhzhia); construct a management center in Kyiv; and support a fiber optic network roll-out in rural areas. The ultimate goal of this project was for Ukrtelecom to provide its customers with broadband internet services with an access speed of up to 50 Mb/s using VDSL and up to 1 Gb/s using FTTH/GPON technologies. Implementation commenced in 2016. However, it appears to have stalled because Ukrtelecom was deeply in debt and engaged in various debt-related litigations.   In February 2018, Ukrtelecom received from CDB a waiver of its rights to claim early repayment of the loan that arose as a result of these litigations. This waiver was to remain in force as long as (a) court authorities did not take any adverse decisions related to the litigations; and (b) any amicable settlements resulting from the litigations did not have a significant negative impact on Ukrtelecom (in the creditor’s opinion). Taking into account that all court decisions in the litigations that caused the failure to honor obligations under the agreement with CDB were made in favor of Ukrtelecom, CDB’s waiver of the rights to claim early repayment of the loan granted in February 2018 remained valid as at December 31, 2018. In addition, in 2018, Ukrtelecom received a separate letter by which CDB confirmed its waiver of the right to claim early repayment due to untimely payment of interest and the availability of qualifications in an auditor’s report.",1. Ukrtelecom was governed by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications of Ukraine with 92.9% of its shares belonging to the Government of Ukraine until an Austrian investment firm (EPIC) bought a 92.79 percent stake in the company for $1.3 billion in 2011.,"# Sector

In July 2015, China Development Bank (CDB) and Ukrtelecom JSC (also known as Ukrtelecom, Укртелеком, or PFTS: UTLM) signed a $50 million loan agreement to modernize Ukrtelecom’s technological infrastructure. The loan has no grace period, a maturity period of 7 years, and an interest rate of 9.34%. Ukrtelecom pledged some of its properties as collateral for the loan. The proceeds of the loan were used by the borrower to finance a contract with Huawei Technologies Ltd. As of December 31, 2018, the undrawn balance under the CDB loan amounted to $18,489,000.   The purpose of the project (supported by the CDB loan) was to modernize Ukrtelecom’s technological infrastructure in the six largest cities of Ukraine (Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Dnipro, Donetsk, and Zaporizhzhia); construct a management center in Kyiv; and support a fiber optic network roll-out in rural areas. The ultimate goal of this project was for Ukrtelecom to provide its customers with broadband internet services with an access speed of up to 50 Mb/s using VDSL and up to 1 Gb/s using FTTH/GPON technologies. Implementation commenced in 2016. However, it appears to have stalled because Ukrtelecom was deeply in debt and engaged in various debt-related litigations.   In February 2018, Ukrtelecom received from CDB a waiver of its rights to claim early repayment of the loan that arose as a result of these litigations. This waiver was to remain in force as long as (a) court authorities did not take any adverse decisions related to the litigations; and (b) any amicable settlements resulting from the litigations did not have a significant negative impact on Ukrtelecom (in the creditor’s opinion). Taking into account that all court decisions in the litigations that caused the failure to honor obligations under the agreement with CDB were made in favor of Ukrtelecom, CDB’s waiver of the rights to claim early repayment of the loan granted in February 2018 remained valid as at December 31, 2018. In addition, in 2018, Ukrtelecom received a separate letter by which CDB confirmed its waiver of the right to claim early repayment due to untimely payment of interest and the availability of qualifications in an auditor’s report.",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,General Infrastructure,Project focuses on telecommunications infrastructure modernization without clear environmental or energy transition impacts,"Modernization of technological infrastructure, broadband internet services, fiber optic network roll-out"
