The project's goal was to construct a new pavilion at the Arzobispo Loayza National Hospital in Lima that would house a new Intensive Care Unit, Intermediate Care Unit, Blood Bank, Central Sterilization Unit, and Nutrition Center. The building was to occupy 1964 square meters of a 4205 square meter area and include two floors and a basement. The purpose of the expansion was to better provide medical service to Lima and the general population of Peru, according to the 2009 Peruvian Minister of Health. The expansion was also part of a greater push by the Peruvian government to invest in new infrastructure and health equipment in 2009 and 2010.  The Chinese government first agreed to the hospital expansion project in Letters of Exchange signed with the Peruvian International Cooperation Agency of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Agencia Peruana de Cooperación Internacional/APCI) on March 30, 2007. On February 13, 2008, the design contract was signed with the Beijing Institute of Architectural Design (see project #46985). On July 7, 2009, the construction contract was signed. The groundbreaking ceremony took place December 28, 2009. The Chinese government, through the construction contract, sent a team of technicians to assist with the construction. A project to install a vapor network system and other additions was approved on February 7, 2011. It was funded through the Peruvian Ministry of Health and was installed between the end of construction and the inauguration ceremony. Construction ended on March 28, 2011, and the inauguration and handover ceremony took place May 13, 2011.   There is evidence that preparation for the execution of this project began prior to the signing of the Letters of Exchange on March 30, 2007. See comments for more information.

It may be that this project captures the construction of the building itself, while 56274 captures the installation of the units inside the building (such as the Blood Bank, etc.)Project 46995 captures what may either be a duplicate of this project, an earlier version of the same intensive care pavilion captured in this project that was subsequently suspended and replaced, or a precursor to this project. On June 2, 2005, an agreement to install an intensive care unit at the Archbishop Loayza Hospital was signed. The construction of an intensive care pavilion to be funded by the Chinese government is listed as a not-yet-executed cooperation project in a 2005 APCI document. A design team from China arrived in Peru on a protocol visit regarding the architectural design of a pavilion within the hospital on March 13, 2006 (see 'Memoria Anual 2006'). The relationship between the pavilions committed in June 2005 (captured in 46995) and March 2007 (captured here) is unclear. It is possible it is a separate project altogether. More likely, it is (1) a suspended, earlier version of this project; or (2) these pre-2007 steps were part of the implementation of this project, and were simply taken prior to funds being officially committed on March 30, 2007.","# Sector

The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: 20 year maturity, 5 year grace period, 2% interest rate. The final maturity date of the loan is March 21, 2026.

The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: 20 year maturity, 5 year grace period, 2% interest rate, and 0.3% management fee. The final maturity date of the loan is September 21, 2026. The GCL that was signed on May 11, 2006 is captured in Project ID#49079. The GCL that was signed on January 15, 2007 is captured in Project ID#49078.   The proceeds of both GCLs were to be used to be the borrower to finance a commercial contract between the Philippines' Bureau of Customs and Nuctech Company Limited. The purpose of the NCISP was to purchase and install x-ray scanners for use in the country’s major customs collection districts, including the Port of Manila, Manila International Container Port, Port of Subic, Port of Clark, Port of Batangas, Port of Cebu, Port of Davao, Port of Cagayan de Oro, Sub-Port of General Santos, Port of Zamboanga. Each of these scanners was capable of inspecting at least 20 forty-foot containers or 17 forty-foot containers per hour.   The objectives of the project included improving accuracy and correctness of assessment and collection of duties and taxes; combatting smuggling and the illegal entry of drugs and hazardous materials; and improving the inflow and outflow of containers through the country’s ports. Phase 1 supported the acquisition and installation of 10 x-ray scanners for use in the country’s major customs collection districts. Phase 2 supported the acquisition and installation of 20 x-ray scanners. Under Phase 2, three scanners each were earmarked for use in the South Harbor Port and the Manila International Container Port; two scanners were earmarked for use at the NAIA airport; and one scanner each was earmarked for use in the Cebu City, Subic, Clark, Batangas, San Fernando, Legaspi, Iloilo, Tacloban, Surigao, Cagayan de Oro, Zamboanga and Davao Ports.   Nuctech Company Limited was the contractor responsible for the implementation of both phases, and its work was overseen by the Philippines' Bureau of Customs. After President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed Executive Order No. 592 on December 16, 2006 and imposed the mandatory payment of a Container Security Fee to support the NCISP, Commissioner Morales issued Customs Memorandum Order No. 6-2007 on March 28, 2007 and created an x-ray committee to carry out effectively the mandate of the Project. CMO No. 6-2007 enumerated guidelines for the conduct of x-ray inspection on containerized shipments and established an X-Ray Inspection Project (XIP) as a specialized and technical unit that would oversee the administrative and operational control of all x-ray scanning equipment. This container inspection system was put into effect in July 2007 and it reportedly led to a reduction in the number of shipments subjected to actual physical inspection (due to the fact that the scanners clearly demonstrated which cargoes needed to be examined physically).   However, this project was also plagued by controversy due to allegations of artificially inflated costs. In 2016, the Philippines’ Commission on Audit (COA) asked the Bureau of Customs (BOC) to review the 2006 commercial contract with Nuctech Company Limited and the China Eximbank loan agreements that were used to finance the commercial contract (after COA found that the mobile X-ray machines purchased in 2006 were exorbitantly overpriced’ (by PHP 4.215 billion). The Government of the Philippines paid PHP 7.953 billion to Nuctech Company Limited for 30 units of mobile X-ray equipment. But when COA asked for a quotation from another international supplier of non-intrusive container inspection scanners, it found that the Government of the Philippines could have purchased the X-ray machines at a lower price for even better performance. COA's quotation from the said supplier showed that an X-ray machine ‘with vastly superior performance’ would only cost PHP 124.6 million each, for a total of PHP 3.738 billion for thirty units. A special COA audit noted that these x-ray machines could ‘be utilized at sea ports that can scan trucks and containers five times the speed of the mobile X-rays that BOC have’.  Aside from overpriced nature of the x-ray machines, the COA audit found that the maintenance cost of the X-ray machines from Nuctech Company Limited was substantially higher (by PHP 3.264 million) compared to other suppliers.","1. The Government of Philippines loan identification number for the China Eximbank loan that supported Phase 2 of the Non-Intrusive Container Inspection System Project is CHI-4. Its loan identification number in the Debt Management and Financial Analysis System (DMFAS) is 29607000. 2. During a November 7, 2007 budget hearing, Bureau of Customs Commissioner Napoleon Morales reported that each x-ray scanner from Nuctech Company Limited would cost $2.5 million. However, in the public biddings of the Los Angeles Harbor Department and the Iceland State Trading Centre, the average cost of an x-ray scanner from Nuctech Company Limited is identified as $1.9 million. 3.
