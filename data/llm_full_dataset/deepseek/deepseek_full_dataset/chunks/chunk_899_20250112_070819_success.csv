The PBC carries the following terms: 20 year maturity, 5 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The proceeds from this loan will be used to finance a commercial contract between Avic International Holding Corporation (AVIC) and Gabon’s Ministry of Vocational Training, which was signed on June 15, 2013.   The purpose of this project is to build and equip three vocational training and development centers in the cities of Owendo, Port-Gentil and M'Vengué (Franceville). Each center will be equipped with materials, technology, appliances, and furniture. Each center will provide training in up to 10 different industries and accommodate up to 600 students who will live onsite. These centers are being created to improve the country’s employment situation, especially among young people.   AVIC was the contractor responsible for project implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on August 11, 2017. However, the first China Eximbank loan disbursement did not take place until June 2018. An inauguration ceremony for the three vocational centers (including the Multisectoral International Center for Vocational Training and Education in the special economic zone of N’kok) took place on April 9, 2021.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Construction and Equipping of Vocational Training and Development Centers Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In mid-2014, a decline in international oil prices generated sharp reductions in Gabon’s oil exports and fiscal revenues. The country’s rising fiscal deficit led to the accumulation of arrears to external creditors. By 2017, the stock of the Government of Gabon’s external arrears stood at $115 million, including arrears to China, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Israel, and South Korea. All of these arrears were successfully cleared by 2020. However, the Government of Gabon accumulated $3 million of additional arrears to Chinese creditors in 2020.  By the end of May 2021, ‘the stock of [the Government of] Gabon’s external arrears stood at CFAF 98.03 billion (US$182.1 million), including CFAF 23.8 billion (US$44.2 million) vis-à-vis multilaterals and CFAF 21.05 billion (US$39.1 million) vis-à-vis government agencies and private creditors insured with companies from Paris Club member countries and from China [ICBC and China Construction Bank] CFAF 1.3 billion (US$2.42 million). The Government's strategy for the clearance of existing external arrears consists of focusing primarily on multilateral debt, bilateral debt, insured commercial commitments and seeking agreements with other creditors prior to the IMF Board meeting. Accordingly, we will clear the arrears vis-à-vis the multilaterals. We will also clear bilateral and commercial-insured arrears as follows: (i) Austria CFAF 6.83 billion (US$12.69 million); (ii) France CFAF 11.9 billion (US$22.11 million); (iii) Israel CFAF 2.23 billion (US$4.13 million); and Spain CFAF 0.09 billion (US$0.17 million).

China Eximbank provides loan for Libreville Municipal Road Renovation Project (Linked to Project ID#60353)

# Description
In 2015, the Government of Gabon signed a loan agreement with China Construction Bank for the Libreville Municipal Road Renovation Project. In the same year, the Government of Gabon signed a loan agreement with China Eximbank for the Libreville Municipal Road Renovation Project. The precise face values and borrowing terms of these loans are unknown. Project ID#60353 captures the China Construction Bank loan. Project ID#60350 captures the China Eximbank loan. The loan proceeds were to be used by the borrower to finance an $80 million (CFA 40 billion) commercial contract between the Government of Gabon and China Construction 5th Engineering Division Corp., Ltd. (CCFED) (中建五局土木工程有限公司).   The project involved the renovation of 81 municipal roads scattered in densely populated districts of Libreville, Ndoum, Akanda, and Owendo (measuring 108 km in length).   Wuhan Comprehensive Transportation Research Institute Co. Ltd. was the contractor responsible for project design, and CCFED — a subsidiary of CSCEC — was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Wuhan Comprehensive Transportation Research Institute Co. Ltd. was commissioned to undertake the design of the project in February 2016. Then, on May 20, 2016, a groundbreaking ceremony took place in the town of Okala. The commercial contract with CCFED specified an 10 month implementation period and the project was expected to reach completion by March 9, 2017. It was ultimately completed, but its precise completion date is unknown.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank and China Construction Bank loans for the Construction and Libreville Municipal Road Renovation Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In mid-2014, a decline in international oil prices generated sharp reductions in Gabon’s oil exports and fiscal revenues. The country’s rising fiscal deficit led to the accumulation of arrears to external creditors. By 2017, the stock of the Government of Gabon’s external arrears stood at $115 million, including arrears to China, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Israel, and South Korea. All of these arrears were successfully cleared by 2020. However, the Government of Gabon accumulated $3 million of additional arrears to Chinese creditors in 2020.  By the end of May 2021, ‘the stock of [the Government of] Gabon’s external arrears stood at CFAF 98.03 billion (US$182.1 million), including CFAF 23.8 billion (US$44.2 million) vis-à-vis multilaterals and CFAF 21.05 billion (US$39.1 million) vis-à-vis government agencies and private creditors insured with companies from Paris Club member countries and from China [ICBC and China Construction Bank] CFAF 1.3 billion (US$2.42 million). The Government's strategy for the clearance of existing external arrears consists of focusing primarily on multilateral debt, bilateral debt, insured commercial commitments and seeking agreements with other creditors prior to the IMF Board meeting. Accordingly, we will clear the arrears vis-à-vis the multilaterals. We will also clear bilateral and commercial-insured arrears as follows: (i) Austria CFAF 6.83 billion (US$12.69 million); (ii) France CFAF 11.9 billion (US$22.11 million); (iii) Israel CFAF 2.23 billion (US$4.13 million); and Spain CFAF 0.09 billion (US$0.17 million).
