67325,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,ICBC contributes to $4.435 billion syndicated debt financing package for Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge (Kurtköy-Akyazı Section) Refinancing Project (Linked to Project ID#67331),"On May 29, 2012, Turkey's Ministry of Transport granted a 10-year concession agreement to ICA IC İçtaş Astaldi Üçüncü Boğaz Köprüsü ve Kuzey Marmara Otoyolu Yatırım ve İşletme A.Ş. (IC Ictas-Astaldi or ICA) — a joint venture between an Italian construction company called Astaldi S.P.A (33.33% ownership stake) and a Turkish construction company called IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S. (66.66% ownership stake) — for the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project (also known as the Third Bosphorus Bridge PPP Project and the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge PPP Project). 30 months of the 10-year concession is for bridge construction activities and the remaining period is for bridge management activities. The public-private partnership (PPP) project was implemented on a BOT (Build, Operate, Transfer) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. The original, non-recourse $2.67 billion debt financing package consisted of two syndicated loan agreements with two different special purpose vehicles (project companies): a $1.04 billion loan with Avrupa Otoyolu Yatirim ve Iletme A.S. for the 171 km Kurtköy-Akyazı Section (“Asia Section” or “NMM Asia”) of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project and a $1.63 billion loan with KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. for the 90 km Kınalı-Odayeri Section (“Europe Section” or “NMM Europe”) of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project. The loan agreements were signed in September 2013 and financial close was achieved May 2014. The loan were issued by six local banks, including Turkish banks (Türkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Is Bankasi A.S., QNB Finansbank A.S., T.C. Ziraat Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. and Türkiye Vakiflar Bankasi T.A.O.). One loan will mature in December 2022 (with a fixed interest rate of 7.6%) and the other will mature in June 2024 (with a floating interest rate of LIBOR + 550 basis points).   Additionally, $600 million of equity financing was provided by Astaldi S.P.A and IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S.: $387.33 million IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S. and $193.67 million from Astaldi S.P.A. The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee, agreeing to repay the debt incurred by borrower/project company (IC Ictas-Astaldi) in the event that it defaulted on its repayment obligations. The Government of Turkey’s General Directorate of Highways (KGM) also provided a minimum traffic guarantee to the project company (to secure the payback of the debt and equity if the generated revenue was insufficient).   Then, in 2018, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's branch in Turkey (ICBC Turkey) was mandated by IC Ictas-Astaldi to lead and arrange syndication for the refinancing of $2.67 billion of debt used to construct the Third Bosphorus Bridge (or Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge) and North Marmara Motorway PPP Project. A letter of authorization for the refinancing was signed at the One Belt, One Road Investment and Financial Cooperation Summit in Ankara on July 26, 2018. Under the agreement, ICBC Turkey agreed in principle to facilitate the refinancing of the project, previously funded by the Turkish banking system, on more favorable terms.   Then, in September 2019, two syndicated loan agreements worth $4.435 billion were signed (with ICBC serving as the lead arranger) for the Kurtköy-Akyazı and Kınalı-Odayeri sections of the project: a $2,840,000,000 loan agreement was signed by KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. and a group of ten lenders (ICBC Turkey, Bank of China, Kuveyt Türk Katilim Bankasi A.S., Albaraka Türk Katılım Bankası A.Ş., Türkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Is Bankasi A.S., QNB Finansbank A.S., T.C. Ziraat Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. and Türkiye Vakiflar Bankasi T.A.O.) to refinance the $1.04 billion loan that was issued in September 2013 for the 171 km Kurtköy-Akyazı Section of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project and finance new/additional capex requirements as a result of changes in the project scope (that increased the total cost of the project’s 171 km Kurtköy-Akyazı Section to $3.646 billion); and a $1,595,000,000 loan was signed by KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. and a group of ten lenders (ICBC Turkey, Bank of China, Kuveyt Türk Katilim Bankasi A.S., Albaraka Türk Katılım Bankası A.Ş., Türkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Is Bankasi A.S., QNB Finansbank A.S., T.C. Ziraat Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. and Türkiye Vakiflar Bankasi T.A.O.) to refinance the $1.63 billion loan that was issued in September 2013 for the 90 km Kınalı-Odayeri Section of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project and finance new/additional capex requirements as a result of changes in the project scope (that increased the total cost of the project’s 90 km Kınalı-Odayeri Section to $2.077 billion). The two loans have two different maturity lengths, reflecting the different concession lengths of the two sponsors. The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee for both loans on September 16, 2019. The total amount that was reportedly provided (across both loans) by ICBC Turkey was $1 billion (as captured via Project ID#67325). Bank of China’s estimated contribution to both loans ($381,666,666) is captured via Project ID#67331.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 1.408 kilometer long-span bridge to be used by road vehicles and trains to cross the Bosphorus Strait from Poyrazkoy in Asia to Garipce in Europe, as well as the construction of a section of the North Marmara Highway along the Odayeri-Pasakoy route. The bridge is 59 meters long and it stretches 1,408 meters over the Bosporus, linking the European and Asian sides of Istanbul. It has eight highway lanes (4 in each direction), divided by two high-speed rail corridors of 1,048 meters. The bridge is a critical part of the larger Northern Marmara Highway (Motorway) Project, linking to the Odayeri-Pasaköy route of the Motorway. The 261 km km Northern Marmara Highway was intended to increase economic efficiency in Turkey, allow for greater access to Istanbul Airport, provide alternate routes to going through Istanbul, and start on the western side of Istanbul and end in the eastern Marmara province of Sakarya. ICA IC İçtaş Astaldi Üçüncü Boğaz Köprüsü ve Kuzey Marmara Otoyolu Yatırım ve İşletme A.Ş. (IC Ictas-Astaldi) was responsible for project implementation. Construction began in September 2012 using the SPV's equity, and was originally expected to take 36 months. The Odayeri-Paşaköy section of the motorway was completed August 26, 2016. The Kurtköy-Akyazı section of the project was completed and opened to traffic on December 19, 2020.   On December 23, 2019, China Merchants Expressway Network & Technology Holdings Co. Ltd, China Merchants Union (BVI) Limited, Jiangsu Expressway Company Limited, Zhejiang Expressway Co. Ltd., Anhui Expressway Company Limited and Sichuan Expressway Co announced that it had entered an agreement and jointly set up a consortium company (“Consortium Company”) to acquire: (1) 51% equity stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi (the SPV responsible for the Third Bosphorus Bridge PPP Project); (2) 51% of a related shareholder loan of IC Ictas-Astaldi; and (3) 51% equity stake in Eurasia Motorway Maintenance and Operations Limited (“IC Maintenance”), a company engages in the operations and maintenance of projects operated by IC Ictas-Astaldi.

# Title
ICBC contributes to $4.435 billion syndicated debt financing package for Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge (Kurtköy-Akyazı Section) Refinancing Project (Linked to Project ID#67331)

# Description
On May 29, 2012, Turkey's Ministry of Transport granted a 10-year concession agreement to ICA IC İçtaş Astaldi Üçüncü Boğaz Köprüsü ve Kuzey Marmara Otoyolu Yatırım ve İşletme A.Ş. (IC Ictas-Astaldi or ICA) — a joint venture between an Italian construction company called Astaldi S.P.A (33.33% ownership stake) and a Turkish construction company called IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S. (66.66% ownership stake) — for the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project (also known as the Third Bosphorus Bridge PPP Project and the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge PPP Project). 30 months of the 10-year concession is for bridge construction activities and the remaining period is for bridge management activities. The public-private partnership (PPP) project was implemented on a BOT (Build, Operate, Transfer) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. The original, non-recourse $2.67 billion debt financing package consisted of two syndicated loan agreements with two different special purpose vehicles (project companies): a $1.04 billion loan with Avrupa Otoyolu Yatirim ve Iletme A.S. for the 171 km Kurtköy-Akyazı Section (“Asia Section” or “NMM Asia”) of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project and a $1.63 billion loan with KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. for the 90 km Kınalı-Odayeri Section (“Europe Section” or “NMM Europe”) of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project. The loan agreements were signed in September 2013 and financial close was achieved May 2014. The loan were issued by six local banks, including Turkish banks (Türkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Is Bankasi A.S., QNB Finansbank A.S., T.C. Ziraat Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. and Türkiye Vakiflar Bankasi T.A.O.). One loan will mature in December 2022 (with a fixed interest rate of 7.6%) and the other will mature in June 2024 (with a floating interest rate of LIBOR + 550 basis points).   Additionally, $600 million of equity financing was provided by Astaldi S.P.A and IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S.: $387.33 million IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S. and $193.67 million from Astaldi S.P.A. The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee, agreeing to repay the debt incurred by borrower/project company (IC Ictas-Astaldi) in the event that it defaulted on its repayment obligations. The Government of Turkey’s General Directorate of Highways (KGM) also provided a minimum traffic guarantee to the project company (to secure the payback of the debt and equity if the generated revenue was insufficient).   Then, in 2018, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's branch in Turkey (ICBC Turkey) was mandated by IC Ictas-Astaldi to lead and arrange syndication for the refinancing of $2.67 billion of debt used to construct the Third Bosphorus Bridge (or Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge) and North Marmara Motorway PPP Project. A letter of authorization for the refinancing was signed at the One Belt, One Road Investment and Financial Cooperation Summit in Ankara on July 26, 2018. Under the agreement, ICBC Turkey agreed in principle to facilitate the refinancing of the project, previously funded by the Turkish banking system, on more favorable terms.   Then, in September 2019, two syndicated loan agreements worth $4.435 billion were signed (with ICBC serving as the lead arranger) for the Kurtköy-Akyazı and Kınalı-Odayeri sections of the project: a $2,840,000,000 loan agreement was signed by KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. and a group of ten lenders (ICBC Turkey, Bank of China, Kuveyt Türk Katilim Bankasi A.S., Albaraka Türk Katılım Bankası A.Ş., Türkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Is Bankasi A.S., QNB Finansbank A.S., T.C. Ziraat Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. and Türkiye Vakiflar Bankasi T.A.O.) to refinance the $1.04 billion loan that was issued in September 2013 for the 171 km Kurtköy-Akyazı Section of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project and finance new/additional capex requirements as a result of changes in the project scope (that increased the total cost of the project’s 171 km Kurtköy-Akyazı Section to $3.646 billion); and a $1,595,000,000 loan was signed by KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. and a group of ten lenders (ICBC Turkey, Bank of China, Kuveyt Türk Katilim Bankasi A.S., Albaraka Türk Katılım Bankası A.Ş., Türkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Is Bankasi A.S., QNB Finansbank A.S., T.C. Ziraat Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. and Türkiye Vakiflar Bankasi T.A.O.) to refinance the $1.63 billion loan that was issued in September 2013 for the 90 km Kınalı-Odayeri Section of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project and finance new/additional capex requirements as a result of changes in the project scope (that increased the total cost of the project’s 90 km Kınalı-Odayeri Section to $2.077 billion). The two loans have two different maturity lengths, reflecting the different concession lengths of the two sponsors. The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee for both loans on September 16, 2019. The total amount that was reportedly provided (across both loans) by ICBC Turkey was $1 billion (as captured via Project ID#67325). Bank of China’s estimated contribution to both loans ($381,666,666) is captured via Project ID#67331.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 1.408 kilometer long-span bridge to be used by road vehicles and trains to cross the Bosphorus Strait from Poyrazkoy in Asia to Garipce in Europe, as well as the construction of a section of the North Marmara Highway along the Odayeri-Pasakoy route. The bridge is 59 meters long and it stretches 1,408 meters over the Bosporus, linking the European and Asian sides of Istanbul. It has eight highway lanes (4 in each direction), divided by two high-speed rail corridors of 1,048 meters. The bridge is a critical part of the larger Northern Marmara Highway (Motorway) Project, linking to the Odayeri-Pasaköy route of the Motorway. The 261 km km Northern Marmara Highway was intended to increase economic efficiency in Turkey, allow for greater access to Istanbul Airport, provide alternate routes to going through Istanbul, and start on the western side of Istanbul and end in the eastern Marmara province of Sakarya. ICA IC İçtaş Astaldi Üçüncü Boğaz Köprüsü ve Kuzey Marmara Otoyolu Yatırım ve İşletme A.Ş. (IC Ictas-Astaldi) was responsible for project implementation. Construction began in September 2012 using the SPV's equity, and was originally expected to take 36 months. The Odayeri-Paşaköy section of the motorway was completed August 26, 2016. The Kurtköy-Akyazı section of the project was completed and opened to traffic on December 19, 2020.   On December 23, 2019, China Merchants Expressway Network & Technology Holdings Co. Ltd, China Merchants Union (BVI) Limited, Jiangsu Expressway Company Limited, Zhejiang Expressway Co. Ltd., Anhui Expressway Company Limited and Sichuan Expressway Co announced that it had entered an agreement and jointly set up a consortium company (“Consortium Company”) to acquire: (1) 51% equity stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi (the SPV responsible for the Third Bosphorus Bridge PPP Project); (2) 51% of a related shareholder loan of IC Ictas-Astaldi; and (3) 51% equity stake in Eurasia Motorway Maintenance and Operations Limited (“IC Maintenance”), a company engages in the operations and maintenance of projects operated by IC Ictas-Astaldi.

The total amount that was reportedly provided (across both loans) by ICBC Turkey was $1 billion (as captured via Project ID#67325). Bank of China’s estimated contribution to both loans ($381,666,666) is captured via Project ID#67331.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 1.408 kilometer long-span bridge to be used by road vehicles and trains to cross the Bosphorus Strait from Poyrazkoy in Asia to Garipce in Europe, as well as the construction of a section of the North Marmara Highway along the Odayeri-Pasakoy route. The bridge is 59 meters long and it stretches 1,408 meters over the Bosporus, linking the European and Asian sides of Istanbul. It has eight highway lanes (4 in each direction), divided by two high-speed rail corridors of 1,048 meters. The bridge is a critical part of the larger Northern Marmara Highway (Motorway) Project, linking to the Odayeri-Pasaköy route of the Motorway. The 261 km km Northern Marmara Highway was intended to increase economic efficiency in Turkey, allow for greater access to Istanbul Airport, provide alternate routes to going through Istanbul, and start on the western side of Istanbul and end in the eastern Marmara province of Sakarya. ICA IC İçtaş Astaldi Üçüncü Boğaz Köprüsü ve Kuzey Marmara Otoyolu Yatırım ve İşletme A.Ş. (IC Ictas-Astaldi) was responsible for project implementation. Construction began in September 2012 using the SPV's equity, and was originally expected to take 36 months. The Odayeri-Paşaköy section of the motorway was completed August 26, 2016. The Kurtköy-Akyazı section of the project was completed and opened to traffic on December 19, 2020.   On December 23, 2019, China Merchants Expressway Network & Technology Holdings Co. Ltd, China Merchants Union (BVI) Limited, Jiangsu Expressway Company Limited, Zhejiang Expressway Co. Ltd., Anhui Expressway Company Limited and Sichuan Expressway Co announced that it had entered an agreement and jointly set up a consortium company (“Consortium Company”) to acquire: (1) 51% equity stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi (the SPV responsible for the Third Bosphorus Bridge PPP Project); (2) 51% of a related shareholder loan of IC Ictas-Astaldi; and (3) 51% equity stake in Eurasia Motorway Maintenance and Operations Limited (“IC Maintenance”), a company engages in the operations and maintenance of projects operated by IC Ictas-Astaldi. Shareholders of the Consortium Company expected to invest up to $688.5 million. As a part of the acquisition, China Merchants, China Merchants United, Zhejiang Expressway, Jiangsu Expressway, Sichuan Expressway and Anhui Expressway held 31%, 20%, 17.5%, 17.5%, 7% and 7% equity stakes in the Consortium Company, respectively. Upon completion of the acquisition, the Zhejiang Expressway Co., Ltd. would indirectly hold an 8.925% equity stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi, 8.925% of the related shareholder loan of IC Ictas-Astaldi, and an 8.925% equity stake in IC Maintenance, respectively. However, the preliminary agreement that was signed on December 23, 2019 was interrupted due to the Covid-19 pandemic. ICBC, Bank of China, and China Merchants Bank subsequently indicated that they were willing to issue a $1.6 billion loan to the Consortium Company in 2021 to facilitate their acquisition of a 51% ownership stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi for $688.5 million. Their loan would mature in 2027, just before the project company’s concession expired. Sinosure would provide credit insurance. However, IJ Global reported in August 2021 that the Chinese companies in the Consortium Company requested to enter into negotiations to terminate the acquisition agreement. Then, in March 2020, Astaldi sold its stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi (the SPV) to IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S., with the latter becoming the sole owner.",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,General Infrastructure,"The project primarily involves the construction of a bridge and motorway, which are general infrastructure projects without clear environmental or energy transition impacts","Construction of a 1.408 km bridge and a section of the North Marmara Highway, focus on transportation infrastructure"
67340,ENERGY,CDB contributes $460 million to $1.381 billion syndicated buyer’s credit for 1320 MW Coal-Fired Emba Hunutlu Power Station Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#91516 and #91517),"In June 2012, Emba Elektrik Üretim applied to build a 1200 MW coal-fired power plant in Yumurtalık district, where numerous other proposed coal-fired power plant projects are located. An environmental permitting meeting held in Sugözü in September 2012 was met with protests from locals and environmentalists. There was no news on the project for several years, and it seemed possible that it had been abandoned. Along with numerous other proposals, the proposal was revived in 2014 as the 1,200-MW, two-unit Hunutlu plant. The project began the public comment period for environmental permitting in June 2014. In 2015, the land was expropriated, with the price being set at 100 lira per square meter. The Turkish Energy Market Regulation Authority (EPDK) finally permitted the project construction and issued a 49-year generation license on July 9, 2015. Then, on June 29, 2016, Adana Bar, Turkish Bar Associations, Medical Chamber of Adana, Agriculture and Engineers Chamber of Adana and Doğu Akdeniz Çevre Dernekleri (East Mediterranean Environment Associations) filed a lawsuit against seven coal-fired power plant projects in the region, including the Emba Hunutlu power plant. Eighteen months later, on January 30, 2018, the expert report for the court case filed by Adana Bar, Turkish Bar Associations, Medical Chamber of Adana, Agriculture and Engineers Chamber of Adana and Doğu Akdeniz Çevre Dernekleri (East Mediterranean Environment Associations) was published, acknowledging that the Emba Hunutlu power plant would harm the public health and agricultural production in the area. Then, on October 30, 2018, the hearing of the court case by Adana Bar, Turkish Bar Associations, Medical Chamber of Adana, Agriculture and Engineers Chamber of Adana Doğu Akdeniz Çevre Dernekleri (East Mediterranean Environment Associations) was held in Ankara. Despite the expert report, which stated the harmful effects of the plant, the Ankara District Administrative Court decided not to cancel the permit of the Emba Hunutlu power plant.   In April 2019, China Development Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China signed a $1.381 billion syndicated buyer’s credit facility (loan) agreement with EMBA Elektrik Üretim A.S. (also known as ‘EMBA Electricity Production’) — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of Shanghai Electric Power (SEP, 50.01%), AVIC International Project Engineering (2.99%), and two local Turkish investors (47%) — for the 1320 MW Coal-Fired Emba Hunutlu Power Station Construction Project. All three banks acted as joint-lead managers and bookrunners and each bank contributed USD 460 million to the overall syndicated loan. See #91516 for ICBC’s contribution and #91517 for Bank of China’s contribution. The loan carries a 15-year maturity. It is a senior secured amortizing term loan that matures on March 29, 2034. Sinosure provided two overseas investment (equity and debt) insurance policies, with a maximum underwritten amount of $280 million for the equity component and $2.04 billion for the debt component (covering the loan’s principal and interest). Both insurance policies covered the risks of inconvertibility and transfer restrictions, expropriation, war and political violence, with an insurance liability period of 180 months. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $1.7 billion commercial (EPC) contract between EMBA Elektrik Uretim A.S., CLP Power Engineering Co., Ltd (CPIPEC or 上海能源科技发展有限公司), and AVIC-INTL Project Engineering Company, which was initially signed on October 26, 2017 and subsequently revised and updated on April 25, 2019. The 1320 MW Coal-Fired Emba Hunutlu Power Station Construction Project is being financed as an independent power project (IPP) and financed with a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20.   The purpose of the project is to construct a 1200MW supercritical coal-fired power plant — with two 660MW power generation units (‘Unit 1’ and ‘Unit 2’) — in the village of Sugözü village, the district of Yumurtalık, and the province of Adana near the Syrian border. The project will feature two seawater desalination systems to provide 7,320m³ of desalinated water per day for the plant’s operations. A selective catalytic reduction (SCR) DeNOx system will be installed at the plant for the efficient conversion of harmful oxides of nitrogen into N2 and H2O using ammonia. Additionally, facilities such as flue gas desulphurization unit along with dry and wet electrostatic precipitator system will be installed to minimize the dust and particulate emissions from the plant.   The primary infrastructure at the project site will include a turbine building, a crusher house platform, a comprehensive building platform, and an intake platform. In addition, the plant will feature a jetty and associated facilities, and a trestle with a connected road. The power generated by the Hunutlu thermal power plant will be evacuated through 380kV transmission lines and transmitted to the national grid operated by Turkish Electricity Transmission Corporation (TEIAS). The plant will be connected to the electricity transmission line between the Mersin 380 substation and the İsken TPP. A transmission line connecting Hunutlu TPP and Adana 380kV substation will be constructed as part of the project, in addition to three feeder displacement works at Adana 380kV substation. The project also includes the construction a port to receive coal. Upon completion, the plant will reportedly be capable of delivering up to 11.5 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity to the country’s national grid annually. It is expected to contribute an estimated 3% of all electricity supplied across Turkey. The project also expected to provide employment opportunities for 4,000 employees during construction and 500 employees during production phase.   CLP Power Engineering Co., Ltd (CPIPEC or 上海能源科技发展有限公司) and AVIC-INTL Project Engineering Company are the general EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. However, several subcontractors are also involved, including Anhui No.1 Electric Power Construction Co., Ltd. (a subsidiary of China Energy Engineering Group), Ilk Construction, Hyflux Newspring Construction Engineering (Shanghai), ÇİMTEK Mühendislik Mimarlık, HNM Zemin Yapı, and ESI Eurosilo. Preliminary excavation works began in July 2018. Then, a logistical voyage ceremony took place in Shanghai on August 25, 2019, but on-site construction activities did not begin until September 22, 2019. In 2020, Turkey was the worst-hit country by COVID-19 in the MENA region, with over 1.8 million infections. However, altogether 1,831 Chinese and Turkish personnel chose to stay and continue working on the project. In August 2020, to speed up the construction, 455 Chinese staff members flew to Turkey and joined the project, despite the health risks. On February 17, 2020, the project’s first truss gantry crane was successfully hoisted into place. On March 21, 2020, the first steel structure of the Unit 2 boiler was successfully hoisted into place. On July 22, 2020, the power plant’s Unit 1 boiler was successfully hoisted into place. On March 10, 2021, the power plant’s Unit 2 boiler water storage tank furnace was successfully hoisted in place.

Under the financing arrangement, AIIB, EBRD, and BSTDB issued loans worth $100 million, $60 million, and $20 million, respectively. Isbank issued a $90 million loan, while ICBC Turkey issued a $30 million loan and Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) issued a $50 million loan. These loans carried maturity lengths of 11.5 years.   The purpose of the project is to finance the expansion of a 97 MW geothermal power project located in the region of Aydin, Western part of Turkey. The expansion involves the construction of three additional binary GPP units — namely, the 22.6MW Efe-6, the 25MW Efe-7, and the 50MW Efe-8 — along with associated transmission lines, boreholes (22 production wells and 20 reinjection wells), and a pipeline network interconnecting the powerhouse and production wells. The primary infrastructure of the project includes the power plant units consisting of conventional steam turbines, borewells, pipelines, and emergency ponds to collect the geothermal fluids during a crisis. The electricity generated by Efe-6 is fed to the national grid via the existing 3.9km-long 154kV overhead transmission line of the Gürmat-1 GPP, while Efe-8 will use the existing 154kV Gürmat-2 transmission line. Interconnection with the transmission grid requires the construction of two new switchyards adjacent to the Efe-6 and Efe-8 site. Efe-7 is interconnected to the grid without any switchyard using a 31.5kV underground cable system that is 0.9km-long. The project is expected to help Turkey achieve a stable baseload geothermal power generation capacity of 810 gigawatt-hours (GWh) a year in 2022.   Dse Enerji was responsible for project implementation. The project was prepared in accordance with the EBRD Environmental and Social Policy (EBRD E&S Policy) and the EBRD Performance Requirements (EBRD PRs). The Project was placed in Category “A"", in accordance with the EBRD E&S Policy, due to risks associated with the over-ground network of connecting pipelines, their location near populated areas and agricultural land, cumulative land take of the project company’s geothermal power plants and operational carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) emissions. The project was subject to a national Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) procedure and permits were granted by the MoEU for Efe-6, Efe-7 and Efe-8 Geothermal Power Plants (GPPs). The MoEU's approval of the Efe-8 EIA was challenged by a local CSO in Aydin in July 2017 in the local Administrative Court, which revoked the approval in September 2018. An appeal decision by the Chamber of the Council of State reversed the lower court's decision in December 2018, thus rendering the initial granting of the EIA approval valid and in effect while sending back the case to the lower court for re-examination and rendering of a further decision. With this Council of State decision, the project company could proceed with the construction of Efe-8 on the ground of the initial EIA approval; however, the approval needed to be reconfirmed by the Administrative Court. The ESIA prepared in accordance with EBRD’s standards for the original Gürmat-2 project and an ESIA Addendum for the expansion project were disclosed on the EBRD’s website respectively on September 24, 2014 and November 13, 2018. Additional due diligence was undertaken in 2019 following stakeholder concerns and updates on the project permitting resulting in additional mitigation measures. As required by the Lenders, an independent consultant was retained by the project company in 2019 to conduct an Environmental and Social Due Diligence (ESDD) of the project and prepare an Environmental and Social Assessment (ESA), Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP), and Non-Technical Summary (NTS). The ESDD confirmed that the project’s existing and anticipated environmental and social risks and impacts have not materially changed since the ESIA Addendum disclosure in November 2018, but the scrutiny on the industry across Turkey and challenges to geothermal operations in the Germencik region had heightened. It also confirmed that the project was not expected to have any impacts on any protected areas, and it was not expected to be associated with any resettlement. The project was structured to comply with the EBRD's PRs and national requirements. The ESDD also confirmed the project company’s track record in implementing an Environmental, Health, Safety and Social Management System (EHSSMS) in line with the national legislation and familiarity with good international industry practice. However, additional areas for improvement were identified during the ESDD and an updated Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) were developed and disclosed to ensure that the project and operations followed the EBRD's PRs. Measures to mitigate environmental and social impacts during construction, operation, and in case of incidents such as leakage of geothermal fluids, and to strengthen stakeholder outreach were included in the design of the project and relevant 2019 E&S documentation disclosed on the EBRD’s and Company’s website in English and Turkish. As per the 2018 ESIA addendum and confirmed by the 2019 ESA, land acquisition for the project was completed on a willing-buyer/willing-seller basis, and no direct/indirect physical displacement or disruptions in livelihood occurred. Compensation was assessed by the EBRD to have been satisfactory. Outstanding land acquisition for Efe-8's transmission line by the national power distribution company will be monitored by the Company for compliance with PR1 and PR5.   The Efe-6 unit came online in August 2017, followed by the Efe-7, which began commercial operations in October 2018. The environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the Efe-8 was approved after reconsideration by the Turkish government in December 2018. EMRA issued the license for the final unit in 2019. The expansion was originally expected to reach completion with the commissioning of Efe-8 in October 2020. Efe-8 ultimately came online in January 2021.","1.

With this Council of State decision, the project company could proceed with the construction of Efe-8 on the ground of the initial EIA approval; however, the approval needed to be reconfirmed by the Administrative Court. The ESIA prepared in accordance with EBRD’s standards for the original Gürmat-2 project and an ESIA Addendum for the expansion project were disclosed on the EBRD’s website respectively on September 24, 2014 and November 13, 2018. Additional due diligence was undertaken in 2019 following stakeholder concerns and updates on the project permitting resulting in additional mitigation measures. As required by the Lenders, an independent consultant was retained by the project company in 2019 to conduct an Environmental and Social Due Diligence (ESDD) of the project and prepare an Environmental and Social Assessment (ESA), Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP), and Non-Technical Summary (NTS). The ESDD confirmed that the project’s existing and anticipated environmental and social risks and impacts have not materially changed since the ESIA Addendum disclosure in November 2018, but the scrutiny on the industry across Turkey and challenges to geothermal operations in the Germencik region had heightened. It also confirmed that the project was not expected to have any impacts on any protected areas, and it was not expected to be associated with any resettlement. The project was structured to comply with the EBRD's PRs and national requirements. The ESDD also confirmed the project company’s track record in implementing an Environmental, Health, Safety and Social Management System (EHSSMS) in line with the national legislation and familiarity with good international industry practice. However, additional areas for improvement were identified during the ESDD and an updated Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) were developed and disclosed to ensure that the project and operations followed the EBRD's PRs. Measures to mitigate environmental and social impacts during construction, operation, and in case of incidents such as leakage of geothermal fluids, and to strengthen stakeholder outreach were included in the design of the project and relevant 2019 E&S documentation disclosed on the EBRD’s and Company’s website in English and Turkish. As per the 2018 ESIA addendum and confirmed by the 2019 ESA, land acquisition for the project was completed on a willing-buyer/willing-seller basis, and no direct/indirect physical displacement or disruptions in livelihood occurred. Compensation was assessed by the EBRD to have been satisfactory. Outstanding land acquisition for Efe-8's transmission line by the national power distribution company will be monitored by the Company for compliance with PR1 and PR5.   The Efe-6 unit came online in August 2017, followed by the Efe-7, which began commercial operations in October 2018. The environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the Efe-8 was approved after reconsideration by the Turkish government in December 2018. EMRA issued the license for the final unit in 2019. The expansion was originally expected to reach completion with the commissioning of Efe-8 in October 2020.
