37646,EMERGENCY RESPONSE,"China Eximbank provides RMB 440 million government concessional loan for Nuku'alofa Central Business District (CBD) Reconstruction Project (Linked to Project ID#64926, #73428)","After riots and fires in November 2006, the Central Business District (CBD) of the city of Nuku'alofa experienced significant damage. Up to 80% of the CBD was destroyed. In response to these riots on November 19, 2007, China Eximbank and the Government of Tonga signed an RMB 440 million (TOP 118,624,000) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Nuku'alofa Central Business District (CBD) Reconstruction Project. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 2%, a grace period of 5.8333 years, a maturity of 20.8333 years, a management fee of 1%, and a commitment fee of 0.75%. The borrower was expected to use the loan proceeds to finance a November 19, 2007 commercial contract with China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC).

Approximately 60 percent of the proceeds of the loan were earmarked for direct government capital spending while the remaining 40 percent was earmarked for on-lending to the private sector for office, residential, and retail construction activities in the CBD. The Government of Tonga on-lent to private sector entities at an interest rate of 5%.    The purpose of the project was to reconstruct the Central Business District (CBD) of the city of Nuku'alofa. It involved the (a) rehabilitation of the storm water drainage; (b) resurfacing of streets; (c) renovation of sidewalks; (d) landscaping work of the central city park with streetlights; (e) installation of new power supply, including some underground power supply; (f) construction of a soakway for effluent water from septic tanks; (g) extension of the Royal Palace; (h) construction of a new wharf (‘Vuna Wharf’) to attract cruise ships; and (i) reconstruction of office, residential, and retail space (including the Tungi Colonnade, Taumoepeau Building, O.G. Sanft Building, Molisi Tonga Building, and Royco Building).   CCECC was the general contractor responsible for implementation, alongside China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC).  Construction began on November 18, 2008. Phase 1 of the project (including the reconstruction of the Tungi Colonnade, Taumoepeau Building, O.G. Sanft Building, Molisi Tonga Building, the Royco Building, and the Royal Palace) was officially completed on November 19, 2010. Phase 2 (which included the establishment of a “Central Park"" at the corner of Taufa’ahau road and Wellington road, improvements to sidewalks, roads and drainage systems, the reconstruction of Tungi Arcade, and the construction of Vuna Wharf) commenced on January 10, 2011. All Phase 2 activities, excluding the construction of Vuna Wharf, were completed on or around August 14, 2012. The construction of Vuna Wharf was officially completed and handed over to the local authorities on August 12, 2014.   However, this project was controversial in that it contributed to debt sustainability problems for the Government of Tonga. According to a Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis that was published in 2011, the combined face value of the RMB-denominated China Eximbank loan for the Nuku'alofa Central Business District (CBD) Reconstruction Project (captured via Project ID#37646) and the RMB-denominated China Eximbank loan for Phase 3 of the National Road Improvement Project (captured via Project ID#39199) was equivalent to 30% of Tonga’s GDP. Then, In May 2012, the IMF published a report which concluded that “Tonga remains at a high risk of debt distress based on the joint IMF-WB low-income country debt sustainability assessment (LIC DSA). Scheduled repayments on the two loans … from the China EXIM Bank may pose a fiscal challenge unless sufficient cash reserves are built up by improving tax collections and reining in current expenses. [The Government of Tonga’s] balance sheet also faces a currency risk as about 61 percent of the outstanding external debt is denominated in Chinese renminbi.” Due to concerns about Tonga’s public debt levels, the repayment terms of the China Eximbank loan for the Nuku'alofa Central Business District (CBD) Reconstruction Project (via grace period extensions) were rescheduled two times: once in 2013 and again in 2018 (as recorded in Project ID#64926 and Project ID#73428). A September 2013 debt rescheduling agreement between China Eximbank and the Government of Tonga amended the original borrowing terms by extending the grace period from 5 years to 10 years. All other borrowing terms (maturity, interest rate, and fees) were left untouched. The loan was thus rescheduled for semi-annual repayment between September 21, 2018 and September 21, 2028.  Then, in November 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Tonga signed a second debt rescheduling agreement, which amended the original borrowing terms by extending the grace period from 5 years to 15 years. All other borrowing terms (maturity, interest rate, and fees) were left untouched. The loan was thus rescheduled for semi-annual repayment between September 21, 2023 and September 21, 2028. As a result of these reschedulings, the borrower agreed to repay the lion’s share of the loan’s principal (in semi-annual installments) over a 5-year period (September 21, 2023 and September 21, 2028) rather that a 15-year period (September 21, 2013 and September 21, 2028).","1. The Chinese project title is 的汤加努库阿洛法中央商务区（CBD）重建项目 or 汤加首都商务中心区重建项目.2. The main sub-borrowers (private sector entities to which the Government of Tonga on-lent) during Phase 1 were are Janfull IDH Ltd, Tungi Colonnade Ltd, OG Sanft Ltd., MF Taumoepeau Ltd., City Assets Ltd. The main sub-borrower during Phase 2 were Tungi Colonnade Ltd and City Assets Ltd. The Government of Tonga expected to start receiving repayments from these private borrowers after the completion of their office, residential, and retail construction projects. As of March 2012, only one private borrower had started repaying the government. At the end of the Government of Tonga’s 2012 fiscal year, Royco owed TOP 2.2 million, Tungi Collonade owed TOP 16.6 million, Taumoepeau owed TOP 7.2 million, and O.G. Sanft owed TOP 10.2 million. 3. 38% of the China Eximbank loan was reportedly used for the construction of Vuna Wharf (TOP $33.9 million), a project overseen by the Ports Authority of Tonga.
