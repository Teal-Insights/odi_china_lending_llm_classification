65181,ENERGY,Bank of China provides USD 114 million to syndicated loan for 1320 MW Vân Phong 1 Supercritical Coal-Fired Power Plant Project,"In January 2011, the Vân Phong Economic Zone Management Authority approved a plan from Sumitomo Corporation, a Japanese enterprise, to build a two-unit, 1320 MW, coal-fired power plant in the port-industrial complex in Vân Phong Bay. In May 2017, Sumitomo Corporation signed and investment agreement with the Vietnam Ministry of Industry and Trade for the Vân Phong 1 Supercritical Coal-Fired Power Plant Project. In December 2017, the Sumitomo Corporation received an investment certificate and in March 2018, the environmental impact assessment was approved. Sumitomo Corporation created a special purpose vehicle called Van Phong Power Company Limited (VAN PHONG) to carry out the project. This project was supposed to be financed with about USD 1 billion in equity from Sumitomo Corporation and about USD 2 billion in debt.   On April 19, 2019, a consortium of eight banks signed a USD 1.988 billion syndicated loan agreement with Van Phong Power Company Limited (VAN PHONG) for the 2 x 660 MW Van Phong 1 Supercritical Coal-Fired Power Plant Project. Of that total amount, JBIC, the lead arranger, provided a USD 1.199 billion export credit facility. In addition, seven commercial banks including the Bank of China (BOC) provided a USD 799 million term loan. According to IJGlobal, Bank of China contributed USD 114 million to this co-financed portion. The other co-financiers included Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, MUFG Bank, Limited, Mizuho Bank Limited, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Limited, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited, and DBS Bank Limited. Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI) provided political risk coverage for the USD 799 million commercial facility. The Government of Vietnam provided a sovereign guarantee. The borrowing terms are unknown. According to IJGlobal, the loan agreement reached financial close on August 26, 2019.  In this project, VAN PHONG will build, own and operate a super critical coal-fired power plant with an installed capacity of 1,320 MW (two units of 660 MW each) in Van Phong district, Khánh Hòa Province in southern Vietnam. Each unit will be equipped with a once-through pulverised coal-fired boiler and a steam turbine from Toshiba. Both the units will be fitted with electrostatic precipitators (ESP), flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) and low NOX burners to control emissions. The other components of the project include a coal handling plant, an ash pond area, and a switchyard. The Van Phong I power plant will use supercritical technology, with an expected emission intensity of 750 grams - 850 grams CO2 per kilowatt-hour. The plant provides about 9 billion KWh of electricity to the national grid every year. This amount of electricity is transmitted through the 500 KV Van Phong - Vinh Tan transmission line. Covering more than 350 hectares in Nam Van Phong, Ninh Hoa Town, the project is expected to boost the development of Van Phong Economic Zone. The Van Phong 1 thermal power station is estimated to require 3.4 million tonnes (Mt) of coal a year which will be sourced from Australia and Indonesia. The coal shipments for the project are expected to be started from 2023 onwards. This project is responsible for releasing the capacity of Van Phong Power Center (including Van Phong BOT Thermal Power Plant 1), Bac Ai Storage Hydropower Plant and renewable energy sources in Ninh province. Thuan, Binh Thuan into the national electricity system. The electricity generated from this plant will be sold to Vietnam Electricity (EVN), a state-owned enterprise, for 25 years.   In August 2019, a consortium of four companies-- Toshiba Energy Systems & Solutions Corporations (Toshiba ESS), IHI Corporation, CTCI Corporation, and Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction-- was awarded the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract for this project. Toshiba ESS will be in charge of the design, manufacturing, installation and test operation for the stream turbines and generators (STGs) used in the project. Lilama 18 Joint Stock Company is the sub-contractor in charge of installing 2 boilers, each with capacity of 660 MW, and each with a contract value of USD 28.6 million.   The groundbreaking ceremony took place on October 6, 2019. In April 2021, construction began on the steel structure for Van Phong-1 Unit 1's coal-fired boiler.  According to Vietnam's Power Development Plan 7 (PDP7), Phase I of the project was scheduled for completion in 2022 and 2023. Phase II of the project was cancelled.   The design and procurement work at Van Phong 1 Project was affected when a number of contracts for supplying materials and equipment (especially goods originating from China) were interrupted due to COVID-19. The project has also been protested by anti-coal groups in Japan, and on April 16, responding to Bloomberg, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp said two coal-fired power plants in Vietnam will be the last project that OCBC will finance.  As of May 2022, at Van Phong 500kV substation project and connection, the substation ground has been completed, but the connection line part still has 5/62 foundation positions waiting for handover. According to the local government, because the route corridor passes through a densely populated area, the compensation plan and policy are not consistent, leading to the delay in handing over the site.

Bank of China provides USD 114 million to syndicated loan for 1320 MW Vân Phong 1 Supercritical Coal-Fired Power Plant Project

# Description
In January 2011, the Vân Phong Economic Zone Management Authority approved a plan from Sumitomo Corporation, a Japanese enterprise, to build a two-unit, 1320 MW, coal-fired power plant in the port-industrial complex in Vân Phong Bay. In May 2017, Sumitomo Corporation signed and investment agreement with the Vietnam Ministry of Industry and Trade for the Vân Phong 1 Supercritical Coal-Fired Power Plant Project. In December 2017, the Sumitomo Corporation received an investment certificate and in March 2018, the environmental impact assessment was approved. Sumitomo Corporation created a special purpose vehicle called Van Phong Power Company Limited (VAN PHONG) to carry out the project. This project was supposed to be financed with about USD 1 billion in equity from Sumitomo Corporation and about USD 2 billion in debt.   On April 19, 2019, a consortium of eight banks signed a USD 1.988 billion syndicated loan agreement with Van Phong Power Company Limited (VAN PHONG) for the 2 x 660 MW Van Phong 1 Supercritical Coal-Fired Power Plant Project. Of that total amount, JBIC, the lead arranger, provided a USD 1.199 billion export credit facility. In addition, seven commercial banks including the Bank of China (BOC) provided a USD 799 million term loan. According to IJGlobal, Bank of China contributed USD 114 million to this co-financed portion. The other co-financiers included Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, MUFG Bank, Limited, Mizuho Bank Limited, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Limited, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited, and DBS Bank Limited. Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI) provided political risk coverage for the USD 799 million commercial facility. The Government of Vietnam provided a sovereign guarantee. The borrowing terms are unknown. According to IJGlobal, the loan agreement reached financial close on August 26, 2019.  In this project, VAN PHONG will build, own and operate a super critical coal-fired power plant with an installed capacity of 1,320 MW (two units of 660 MW each) in Van Phong district, Khánh Hòa Province in southern Vietnam. Each unit will be equipped with a once-through pulverised coal-fired boiler and a steam turbine from Toshiba. Both the units will be fitted with electrostatic precipitators (ESP), flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) and low NOX burners to control emissions. The other components of the project include a coal handling plant, an ash pond area, and a switchyard. The Van Phong I power plant will use supercritical technology, with an expected emission intensity of 750 grams - 850 grams CO2 per kilowatt-hour. The plant provides about 9 billion KWh of electricity to the national grid every year. This amount of electricity is transmitted through the 500 KV Van Phong - Vinh Tan transmission line. Covering more than 350 hectares in Nam Van Phong, Ninh Hoa Town, the project is expected to boost the development of Van Phong Economic Zone. The Van Phong 1 thermal power station is estimated to require 3.4 million tonnes (Mt) of coal a year which will be sourced from Australia and Indonesia. The coal shipments for the project are expected to be started from 2023 onwards. This project is responsible for releasing the capacity of Van Phong Power Center (including Van Phong BOT Thermal Power Plant 1), Bac Ai Storage Hydropower Plant and renewable energy sources in Ninh province. Thuan, Binh Thuan into the national electricity system. The electricity generated from this plant will be sold to Vietnam Electricity (EVN), a state-owned enterprise, for 25 years.   In August 2019, a consortium of four companies-- Toshiba Energy Systems & Solutions Corporations (Toshiba ESS), IHI Corporation, CTCI Corporation, and Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction-- was awarded the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract for this project. Toshiba ESS will be in charge of the design, manufacturing, installation and test operation for the stream turbines and generators (STGs) used in the project. Lilama 18 Joint Stock Company is the sub-contractor in charge of installing 2 boilers, each with capacity of 660 MW, and each with a contract value of USD 28.6 million.   The groundbreaking ceremony took place on October 6, 2019. In April 2021, construction began on the steel structure for Van Phong-1 Unit 1's coal-fired boiler.  According to Vietnam's Power Development Plan 7 (PDP7), Phase I of the project was scheduled for completion in 2022 and 2023. Phase II of the project was cancelled.   The design and procurement work at Van Phong 1 Project was affected when a number of contracts for supplying materials and equipment (especially goods originating from China) were interrupted due to COVID-19. The project has also been protested by anti-coal groups in Japan, and on April 16, responding to Bloomberg, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp said two coal-fired power plants in Vietnam will be the last project that OCBC will finance.  As of May 2022, at Van Phong 500kV substation project and connection, the substation ground has been completed, but the connection line part still has 5/62 foundation positions waiting for handover. According to the local government, because the route corridor passes through a densely populated area, the compensation plan and policy are not consistent, leading to the delay in handing over the site. Particularly for the 2nd circuit of the 220kV Krong Buk - Nha Trang transmission line, 89/93 foundation positions have been paid for, the rest of the people have not yet agreed to receive the money for handing over the ground.  EVN said that if the project is behind schedule, the Government of Vietnam has to compensate USD 1 million per day to residents. If this transmission project is 6 months behind schedule, the amount to be compensated is about VND 5,000 billion.

Then, in 2012, Vietnam’s Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) approved the project’s environmental impact assessment (EIA). In October 2014, ACWA Power and Taekwang Power Holdings signed a joint development agreement (JDA) for this project. Then, in January 2016, Vietnam’s Ministry of Industry & Trade signed a build-operate-transfer (BOT) agreement with the Taekwang Power Holdings-ACWA Power consortium. Under the terms of the BOT agreement, the consortium agreed to build and operate the power plant for a period of 25 years and then transfer it to the Government of Vietnam. In April 2017, Vinacomin — a Vietnamese state-owned enterprise — reached a coal supply agreement with the two project sponsors. Vietnam’s Ministry of Planning and Investment subsequently issued an investment registration certificate (IRC) to develop the project to Nam Dinh First Power Holdings, a joint venture incorporated by ACWA Power (50% ownership stake) and Taekwang Power Holdings (50% ownership stake) in Singapore in July 2017.  The total project cost is $2.52 billion and it is being financed according to a 75:25 debt-to-equity ratio. On May 8, 2019, ACWA Power and Bank of China (BOC) signed an memorandum of understanding (MOU) regarding the financing of the project. Then, on December 16, 2019, a syndicate of seven Chinese lenders — Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), Bank of China (BOC), China Construction Bank (CCB), China Development Bank (CDB), the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank), China Minsheng Bank (CMBC), and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) — and Nam Dinh First Power Company Limited — a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of Nam Dinh First Power Holdings— signed a $1.89 billion loan agreement for the 1200 MW Nam Dinh 1 Independent Power Project. The loan carries a 20-year maturity, but its grace period and interest rate is unknown. The borrower purchased credit insurance from Sinosure. The loan proceeds are to be used by the borrower to partially finance an EPC contract between ACWA Power and China Gezhouba Group International Engineering Co., Ltd which was signed in May 2019.  CDB's estimated contribution is captured via Project ID#89169. China Eximbank’s estimated contribution is captured via Project ID#90862. BOC’s estimate contribution is captured via Project ID#90863. CCB’s estimated contribution is captured via Project ID#90864. ICBC’s estimated contribution is captured via Project ID#92280. ABC’s estimated contribution is captured via Project ID#92281. China Minsheng Bank’s estimated contribution is not captured in a separate AidData project record because it is a privately-owned bank.  A $600 million equity contribution to the project company (Nam Dinh First Power Company Limited) was split between the two project sponsors: Taekwang Power Holdings (50% stake), a subsidiary of South Korea's Taekwang Group, and First National Operation & Maintenance Co. (50% stake), a subsidiary of Saudi Arabia's ACWA Power.  The purpose of the project is to construct a 1200 MW coal-fired power plant — with two, 600MW power generation units — in Hai Hau District and Nam Dinh Province. The plant is to be equipped with the new application of clean technologies for coal utilization – Circulating Fluidized Bed Combustion (CFBC) as an alternative to Pulverized Coal Combustion (PCC) for power generation with the coal supplied by Vinacomin, a government owned coal mined company. China Gezhouba Group International Engineering Co., Ltd. — a subsidiary of China Gezhouba Group Corporation (CGGC) — is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation.  The 1200 MW Nam Dinh 1 Independent Power Project has experienced a series of delays and implementation obstacles. In order to create the power plant, roughly 300 households will need to relocated and receive compensation. The local population has also expressed concerns regarding pollution of the farming and fishing industries. Additionally, the project has struggled to maintain momentum because the both the Government of Vietnam and the Government of the People's Republic of China have pledged to stop financing and building new coal-fired power projects.  Construction was originally scheduled to begin in 2014. However, according to the Government of Vietnam’s 2016 Revised Power Development Plan, Phase 1 Unit 1 was rescheduled for completion in 2020 and Phase 1 Unit 2 was rescheduled for 2021. Phase 2 was subsequently cancelled. In June 2019, according to a Vietnam Ministry of Industry & Trade's report on the implementation of the revised seventh Power Development Plan (PDP7), the completion date for Unit 1 was further delayed to 2024 and the completion date for Unit 2 was further delayed to 2025. In February 2020, the Government of Vietnam’s National Steering Committee on Power Development stated that Unit 1 was scheduled to be commissioned in Q1 2025 and Unit 2 in Q3 2025. Commissioning dates are now scheduled for 2025. In September 2020, the Standing Deputy Secretary of the Nam Dinh Provincial Party Committee, announced that the first step toward building the power plant would begin with the construction of a road in the coastal economic zone where the plant will be located.  Then, in October 2020, a project company representative disclosed that the project investor was planning to officially sign the BOT contract with the Government of Vietnam by early November 2020. Following this milestone, the investor would transfer all of the funding needed to implement the project, including compensation funds for local stakeholders. Construction was at that time expected to start by the end of 2020.  However, in 2020, ACWA Power decided not to pursue any new coal projects in line with its commitment to decarbonization. Therefore, they have ‘fully written-off the incurred project development and related costs of the Nam Dinh 1 IPP project in Vietnam, amounting to SAR 80.9 million’. As of July 2022, there was no evidence that construction had commenced. However, site preparation work was reportedly underway.","1.
