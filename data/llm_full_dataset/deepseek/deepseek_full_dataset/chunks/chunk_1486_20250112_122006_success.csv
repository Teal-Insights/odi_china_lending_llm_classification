The payment of the loan and the accumulated interest was scheduled to take place over thirty equal monthly payments, starting on June 1, 2011 and ending on November 1, 2013.

# Title
CBMI Construction Co., Ltd. provides $31.9 million supplier credit for Al Badia Cement Plant Project

# Description
On June 9, 2008, CBMI Construction Co., Ltd and the Al Badia Cement Company (or Al Badia Cement JSC) — a private company — signed an agreement regarding a $31,947,204 supplier credit (loan) for the Al Badia Cement Plant Project. The loan carried a 6.5% interest rate and a maturity length of 6 years. However, its grace period is unknown. The payment of the loan and the accumulated interest was scheduled to take place over thirty equal monthly payments, starting on June 1, 2011 and ending on November 1, 2013. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower for the construction and operation of the Al Badia Cement Plant in Abu Al Shamat — 80 km east of the city of Damascus — as well as the training of staff at the plant. Upon completion, the plant was expected to generate 3.2 millions of cement each year.   Construction began in September 2008 and a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on May 25, 2009. Plant ignition took place on December 23, 2010, 40 days ahead of schedule. Al Badia Cement Company signed a PAC (Provisional Acceptance Certificate) on June 7, 2011, certifying that CBMI Construction Co., Ltd had completed the works at Al Badia Cement Production line #1 and the installations were ready for handover to the project owner (Al Badia Cement Company). Chinese personnel were still involved in the construction process as late as November 6, 2011, when the Chinese Ambassador to Syria visited the construction site. However, due to the deteriorating security situation in Syria, CBMI Construction Co., Ltd abandoned the project in 2011/2012 and it reportedly failed to honor some of its contractual obligations.   CBMI Construction Co., Ltd and the Al Badia Cement Company later negotiated a settlement whereby Al Badia Cement Company would repay CBMI Construction Co., Ltd only $15 million. As of December 31, 2018, the plant was operational despite various obstacles over several years. According to an 2015 Annual Report published by the Al Badia Cement Company, as of December 31, 2015, it had paid CBMI and a second contractor (ASEC) 232,867,983 SYP in exchange for the contracts to build and operate the factory. In 2016, ISIS militants kidnapped 300 workers from the Al Badia Cement Plant.",TRUE,NA,BROWN,HIGH,Other,Cement production is a high-emission industrial process with significant environmental impact,"Construction and operation of cement plant, annual production capacity of 3.2 million tons of cement"

This loan was issued following the signature of two separate preferential loan framework agreements (one worth RMB 100 million and other worth RMB 250 million). The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 4.5833-year grace period, a 12.0833-year maturity, and a 0.5% management fee (RMB 1.75 million).   The borrower (Syrian Petroleum Company) was to use the proceeds of the GCL to finance a $50 million commercial contract that it signed with China Petroleum Technology and Development Corporation (CPTDC) in 2007. According to written correspondence between Mr. Eng. Omar AL HAMAD (General Manager of the Syrian Petroleum Company) and the Concessional Loan Department of China Eximbank on April 1, 2010, the Government of Syria issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan.   The purpose of the project was to purchase seven new oil drilling rigs, four oil drilling repair rigs, and two cement pumping units for use in Deir ez-Zor Governorate (Arabic: مُحافظة دير الزور‎).   On June 1, 2010, China Eximbank notified the Syrian Petroleum Company that the GCL had become effective.
