However, construction for the 'Projecto de Ampliación del Hospital Loayza' also occurred from 2009-2011, with significant evidence of contracts, the beginning of construction, and the end of construction (see project #56926). One potential explanation is that the construction of the building that would house the Intensive Care Unit, Blood Bank, Sterilization, and Kitchen took place from 2009-2011, while the installation of the units themselves took place from 2011-2013, though there is no direct evidence for this.","# Sector
