95747,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",CDB provides $200 million loan for Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project,"In June 2009, China Development Bank (CDB) agreed to provide a $3 billion line of credit to JSC Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna (also known as ‘Samruk-Kazyna’). Borrowings through the line of credit were to be used for the development of infrastructure and resource projects in Kazakhstan. Then, on October 13, 2009, KAZ Minerals PLC (also known as ‘Kazakhmys Corporation LLC’ and ‘Kazakhmys’) announced that it was in discussions with CDB and Samruk-Kazyna regarding a major unsecured loan facility. Following a memorandum of financial cooperation that was signed by Kazakhmys, Samruk-Kazyna and CDB on November 14, 2009, $2.7 billion from the $3 billion line of credit was allocated to various projects of KAZ Minerals PLC. Then, on December 30, 2009, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC (also known as Kazakhmys Finance PLC) — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals PLC — and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $2 billion facility (loan) agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project. On the same day, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $100 million facility (loan) agreement for the Bozymchak Copper and Gold Mine Development Project. Thirteen days later, on January 12, 2010, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project. Then, on June 11, 2012, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed two additional loan agreements: a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All five loan agreements (collectively worth $2.7 billion) were financed by Samruk-Kazyna via borrowings from the $3 billion CDB line of credit.  All of the loans carried the following borrowing terms: maturities of between 12 and 15 years (with final maturity dates falling between January 2022 and August 2025), 3 year grace periods (with the first loan repayment scheduled for January 2013), annual interest rates of LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin, and 1.5% management fees. A separate fee of $3 million was also payable under the loan agreements for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Project and the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All of the loans were also backed by repayment guarantees from KAZ Minerals PLC and a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna. All five loans reportedly disbursed in full by January 2013. The remaining $300 million under the $3 billion CDB line of credit was utilized (drawn down) by Samruk-Kazyna for an unknown purposes and fully repaid in January 2013. In January 2014, KAZ Minerals PLC fully repaid its loans for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project (since the development of these projects was no longer expected to commence in the near future). Then, on December 29, 2014, two of the loan agreements that KAZ Minerals Finance PLC had previously signed with Samruk-Kazyna (via on-lending from the CDB line of credit) were transformed into bilateral loan agreements with CDB: the loan agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project and the loan agreement for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project. At that time, the face value of the loan for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project was $1,844,000,000 (most likely because some repayments were made between January 2013 and December 2014) and the face value of the loan for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project was upsized to $148,500,000 (for an unknown reason). At that time the borrowing, terms of the two loans with outstanding balances were rescheduled.  The interest rate was lowered from LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin to LIBOR plus a 4.50% margin; and an arrangement fee of 0.5% was agreed upon, of which 60% was paid in December 2014 and 40% was paid in January 2016. The maturities and grace periods of the loan were left unchanged. KAZ Minerals PLC continued to serve as a guarantor for the loans. However, as an additional credit enhancement, the borrower pledged a $100,000,000 minimum cash balance in a charge account (collection account) as a source of collateral. The amended, bilateral loan (facility) agreements between CDB and KAZ Minerals also clarified that the loan proceeds were to be used by the borrower ‘principally for the development of the Bozshakol and Bozymchak [mine] projects.’ As of December 31, 2020, $1.0 billion was drawn down by the borrower under the $1,844,000,000 CDB loan agreement and the $148,500,000 CDB loan agreement. During 2020, the borrower made a $183 million repayment. An additional $181 million repayment was due in 2021. Both CDB loans are repayable in semi-annual installments each January and July with final maturity dates in August 2025.

The Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Abyz copper mine and the Nurkazgan copper mine (exact locational coordinates: 50.16861, 73.00333). Stripping works at Abyz mine commenced in January 2014. At that time, it was expected that the mine would recommence production in Q3 of 2014. The Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Akbastau-Kosmurun copper mine (exact locational coordinates: 48.60611,77.78861 and 48.6437, 77.7102). The project commenced on January 30, 2009. Its completion date is unknown. The Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Zhomart copper mine, which exploits the 14 km long Zhaman-Aybat orefield deposits that are located approximately 160 km southeast of Dzhezkazgan. The first stage of the mine’s development was commissioned in 2006 with a planned capacity of around 4 million tons of ore a year.

31023,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides RMB 592.4 million government concessional loan for Olkaria IV Geothermal Production Wells Drilling Project (Linked to Project ID#58350),"On November 16, 2009, the Chinese Government and the Government of Kenya signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the Olkaria Geothermal Field Project. Then, on April 13, 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Kenya signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 670,000,000 ($93 million) for the for Olkaria IV Geothermal Production Wells Drilling Project. The face value of the loan was subsequently revised to RMB 592,436,205.64. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, and a 6-month grace period. The loan was scheduled for semi-annual repayment installments from August 31, 2010 until March 21, 2030.    The Government of Kenya subsequently signed a subsidiary loan agreement with Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen) -- the largest power producing company in Kenya (responsible for about 69% of the electricity consumed in the country). The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the ultimate borrower (KenGen) to finance its commercial contract with Great Wall Drilling Company (中国石油长城钻探工程有限公司), which was signed in December 2006.   The borrower made principal repayments worth RMB 23,697,448 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and RMB 47,394,896.00 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The loan’s amount outstanding was RMB 473,948,964.52 as of June 30, 2020, RMB 426,554,068.06 as of June 30, 2021, and RMB 379,159,171.61 as of June 30, 2022.   The purpose of the project was to drill 26 steam production wells at the Olkaria IV geothermal field, and thereby support the development of a 140 MW geothermal power plant (station).  The Olkaria IV geothermal field is located Naivasha District and Nakuru County. It is situated just inside the Hell’s Gate National Park, on the eastern edge of the Eastern Rift Valley.   The project was implemented by Kenya's Geothermal Development Company (GDC) — a government special purpose vehicle (SPV) for geothermal development — in collaboration with Great Wall Drilling Company, Kenya Electricity Generating Company Ltd (KenGen), and Kenya's Ministry of Energy & Petroleum. Project implementation commenced on July 23, 2012. It was completed on October 17, 2014.   However, there are indications that the project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to a report from Kenya’s Auditor General for the Year Ended June 30, 2021, '[t]he wells were drilled between the year 2011 and 2015 and have never been connected to any plant for generation of power. [Kenya Electricity Generating Company PLC, which is also known as KenGen] has in the meantime continued to pay the principal sum and interest [of the loan] while no corresponding revenue has been realized to date. Further, [KenGen] Management has not given the details of when the wells will likely be utilized in the generation of power. As a result, there is no value for money obtained on the investment [...].'","1. This project is also known as Olkaria IV--140MW Geothermal Field Production Drilling Project.

A report from Kenya’s Auditor General for the Year Ended June 30, 2021 suggests that total disbursements under the China Eximbank loan amounted to 79,324,783,562 Kenyan shillings.
