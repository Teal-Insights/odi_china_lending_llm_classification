This GCL, which was approved by Sierra Leone’s Parliament in September 2011, carried the following terms: a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.5% commitment fee, and a 0.5% management fee. The proceeds from this loan were used to finance a commercial contract that ZTE Corporation signed with Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Internal Affairs on May 5, 2008.    The purpose of this loan was to help the country’s security and emergency services with different authorities and jurisdictions — including the Office of National Security (ONS), Sierra Leone Police, the Military, Anti-Corruption Commission, Fire Force, Prisons Department, Immigration Department, and Hospitals — to communicate electronically via computers, cell phones and vehicle mounted units. It involved the installation of a Dedicated Security Information System (DSIS) based on Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) 2000 technology. The system included 5,500 mobile phones and 1,000 USB modems. All phone calls on this network were free and fully encrypted to guard against bugging and other malicious cellular interceptions.
