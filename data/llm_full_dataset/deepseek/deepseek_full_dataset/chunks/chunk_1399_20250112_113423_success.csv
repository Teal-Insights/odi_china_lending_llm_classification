62991,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides $120 million loan for 230kV Hin Heup-Luangprabang 2 Power Transmission Line Project,"On August 11, 2009, Sinohydro Group Limited and Electricite du Laos signed a $129 million EPC contract for the 230kV Hin Heup-Luangprabang 2 Power Transmission Line Project. China Eximbank subsequently provided a $120 million loan to the Government of Laos to partially finance the EPC contract. The loan carried a 2% interest rate. However, its maturity and grace period are unknown.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 210 km 230kv electricity transmission line between the Hinheup hydroelectric dam in Vientiane province and Luang Prabang. The project also involved the construction of two substations: one in Hin Heup, a district in Vientiane Province and another (known as ‘Luangprabang 2’) in Xieng Ngeun, a district in Luangprabang Province.   Sinohydro Group Limited was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Construction began on November 8, 2010. Then, on October 31, 2013, the Luangprabang 2 substation was successfully put into operation. This project appears to have reached completion. However, its precise implementation end date is unknown.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the 230kV Hin Heup-Luangprabang 2 Power Transmission Line Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. Laos’ gross foreign exchange reserves were dangerously low between 2019 and 2021, hovering between 1.4 and 2.3 months of import cover, and total public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt increased from 68 percent of GDP ($12.5 billion) in 2019 to 88 percent in 2021 of GDP (or $14.5 billion). According to a report published by the World Bank in April 2022, ‘[t]he energy sector, mostly represented by Électricité du Laos (EDL), accounted for over 30 percent of total PPG debt in 2021. […] EDL’s debt service obligations [were] still unsustainable [at the time], with future debt service accounting for about two fifths of EDL’s total operating revenue.’ The Laotian authorities sought and secured debt service payment deferrals from their Chinese creditors in 2020 and 2021; according to the World Bank, ‘[d]ebt service deferrals granted by major lenders in 2020-2021 amounted around 3.6 percent of GDP in 2021’ and ’[a]s a result, actual debt service payments are estimated to have declined to 48 percent of total revenues in 2021, compared to 65 percent in the 2021 [Government of Laos] plan.’  The country’s central bank (Bank of the Lao P.D.R) also made a $300 million drawdown under its currency swap agreement with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in June 2020 — when its gross reserves stood at only 1.5 months of import cover and credit rating agencies warned of a high default probability. Then, in 2021, the short-term emergency loan from the PBOC was ‘rolled over’ for another year. Around the same time, a Chinese state-owned enterprise purchased a major public infrastructure asset in Laos—a large part of the country’s electricity transmission grid—from EDL as part of an apparent debt-for-equity swap. China Southern Power Grid Co. and EDL established a joint venture known as Électricité du Laos Transmission Company Limited (EDLT) in September 2020.  China Southern Power Grid Co. purchased a 90% ownership stake in EDLT in exchange for a $600 million fee (equity infusion). Then, in March 2021, EDLT signed a 25-year concession agreement, which made it responsible for management of the country’s high-voltage transmission network above 230 kilovolts. Independent observers suggested at the time that EDL would likely use the $600 million upfront payment from China Southern Power Grid Co. to service its outstanding debts to Chinese creditors, although this has not been independently confirmed. According to the World Bank’s International Debt Statistics, the Government of Laos was responsible for making average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $232 million between 2019 and 2019 and average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $60 million between 2020 and 2021 (a substantially lower figure due to payment deferrals); however, it expected to make average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth nearly $678 million over the next seven years (2022-2028).","1.

China Eximbank provides $10.55 million government concessional loan for Xayaburi Rural Electrification Project

# Description
On May 18, 2009, China Southern Power Grid Co., Ltd and Electricite du Laos (EDL) signed a $10.55 million commercial (EPC) contract for the Xayaburi Rural Electrification Project. China Eximbank subsequently issued a government concessional loan (GCL) to the Government of Laos to finance the EPC contract.   The purpose of the project was to  build 4 new 22-kV transmission lines measuring 323 kilometers in length, 400-volt transmission lines measuring 86 kilometers in length, and substation capacity of 4330 kVA within Xayaburi Province. China Southern Power Grid Co., Ltd was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. The project was fully operational as of February 21, 2013. It reportedly benefited 51,000 people and 8,000 households in 69 villages within Xayaburi Province.",TRUE,NA,GREY,HIGH,Grid Infrastructure,"Project focuses on building transmission infrastructure without specifying energy source, making its environmental impact dependent on the power sources it connects to","Construction of 22-kV and 400-volt transmission lines, substation capacity expansion, rural electrification focus"

The borrowing terms and face value of the PBC are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was to use the PBC proceeds to partially finance an EPC contract with China-East Resources Import & Export Co. (CERIECO), a subsidiary of China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC).  The purpose of the project was to construct a 69 km 230kV electricity transmission line and a 27 km 500kV electricity transmission line to evacuate power from the Nam Ngum 2 (NN2) Hydroelectric Power Plant.  CERIECO was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. The project was completed in December 2009.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Nam Ngum 2 (NN2) 230/500kV Transmission Line Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. Laos’ gross foreign exchange reserves were dangerously low between 2019 and 2021, hovering between 1.4 and 2.3 months of import cover, and total public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt increased from 68 percent of GDP ($12.5 billion) in 2019 to 88 percent in 2021 of GDP (or $14.5 billion). According to a report published by the World Bank in April 2022, ‘[t]he energy sector, mostly represented by Électricité du Laos (EDL), accounted for over 30 percent of total PPG debt in 2021. […] EDL’s debt service obligations [were] still unsustainable [at the time], with future debt service accounting for about two fifths of EDL’s total operating revenue.’ The Laotian authorities sought and secured debt service payment deferrals from their Chinese creditors in 2020 and 2021; according to the World Bank, ‘[d]ebt service deferrals granted by major lenders in 2020-2021 amounted around 3.6 percent of GDP in 2021’ and ’[a]s a result, actual debt service payments are estimated to have declined to 48 percent of total revenues in 2021, compared to 65 percent in the 2021 [Government of Laos] plan.’  The country’s central bank (Bank of the Lao P.D.R) also made a $300 million drawdown under its currency swap agreement with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in June 2020 — when its gross reserves stood at only 1.5 months of import cover and credit rating agencies warned of a high default probability. Then, in 2021, the short-term emergency loan from the PBOC was ‘rolled over’ for another year. Around the same time, a Chinese state-owned enterprise purchased a major public infrastructure asset in Laos—a large part of the country’s electricity transmission grid—from EDL as part of an apparent debt-for-equity swap. China Southern Power Grid Co. and EDL established a joint venture known as Électricité du Laos Transmission Company Limited (EDLT) in September 2020.  China Southern Power Grid Co. purchased a 90% ownership stake in EDLT in exchange for a $600 million fee (equity infusion). Then, in March 2021, EDLT signed a 25-year concession agreement, which made it responsible for management of the country’s high-voltage transmission network above 230 kilovolts. Independent observers suggested at the time that EDL would likely use the $600 million upfront payment from China Southern Power Grid Co. to service its outstanding debts to Chinese creditors, although this has not been independently confirmed. According to the World Bank’s International Debt Statistics, the Government of Laos was responsible for making average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $232 million between 2019 and 2019 and average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $60 million between 2020 and 2021 (a substantially lower figure due to payment deferrals); however, it expected to make average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth nearly $678 million over the next seven years (2022-2028).","1.
