53037,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,"China Eximbank makes $147 million loan disbursement for 321 km Lusaka-Ndola Dual Carriageway Project (Linked to Project ID#92425, ID#92430)","In 2015, a Restricted Invitation to Tender (Ref: RDA/PPP/CE/001/15) was issued by the Road Development Agency (RDA) of Zambia. It stated that the RDA intended to enter into a Public-Private Partnership Agreement in form of a concession to undertake the upgrading of the Lusaka to Ndola road to dual carriageway. This Request for Proposals (RFP) solicited for financially and technically competent prospective concessionaires to implement the 321 km Lusaka-Ndola Dual Carriageway Project on a ‘Finance, Design, Construct, Operate, Maintain and Toll’ basis. According to the RDA, the Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) for the project was approximately 29 per cent and the cost of construction was estimated at K930 million. However, in December 2016, the Government of Zambia’s PPP Council granted authority to change the procurement method for the project from a PPP model to an Engineering, Procurement, Construction plus Finance (EPC+F) model.   Then, on May 30, 2017, RDA and China Jiangxi Corporation for International Economic and Technical Cooperation (CJIC or 中国江西国际 or 江西国际) signed an EPC+F contract worth $1,245,775,986.98. CJIC reportedly secured loans from Jiangxi Bank Co., Ltd. (Jiangxi Bank) and the Jiangxi Branch of China Eximbank worth $1,245,775,986.98 in 2018 to finance this EPC+F contract. The Government of Zambia reportedly issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loans. The face value of the Jiangxi Bank loan, which is captured via Project ID#92430, was $187,000,000 (i.e approximately 15% of the cost of the commercial contract. Therefore, the estimated value of the loan from the Jiangxi Branch of China Eximbank is $1,058,909,588.93 (i.e. approximately 85% of the cost of the commercial contract). This loan is captured via Project ID#92430. The borrowing terms of the China Eximbank loan and the Jiangxi Bank Co., Ltd. (Jiangxi Bank) are unknown. However, it is known (based on official RDA documentation) that China Eximbank disbursed approximately $147 million by the end of 2018.  It is also known that, as of July 2022, the Jiangxi Bank loan had achieved a 16% disbursement rate ($30,000,000 out of $187,000,000). In a statement to Parliament, Zambia’s Minister of Infrastructure and Housing later revealed that, although the total contract value of $1,245,775,986 (approx. K11.1 billion) was a major increase from the original estimated K930 million), the project’s EIRR had declined to 15%.   The initial specification for the project included two roads (321 km and 45 km), construction of a new carriageway lane road (6.8m wide w/2m shoulders), median separation, service lanes, pedestrian accommodation facilities, 50mm Asphalt concrete on 200mm crushed stone base, 300mm cement stabilized sub-base, bypasses around Kapiri and Kabwe (business districts), drainage works, reconstruction of existing road, and construction of toll sites. However, the final scope of the project included the construction of 321 km of the core Lusaka to Ndola Dual Carriageway, but not the 45 km of the Kafulafuta to Masangano dual road. The core Lusaka-Ndola Dual Carriageway has several interlinks, including the Lusaka/Kabwe road − T002 (144 km), Kabwe/Kapiri Mposhi road − T002 (61 km), Kapiri Mposhi/Ndola road − T003 (116 km) and Kafulafuta/Masangano road − M006 (45 km). CJIC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation.   A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on September 8, 2017. However, work on the project halted in June 2021 due to overdue contractor payments. Zambia’s Ministry of Finance reportedly issued a directive to postpone the construction on the project. Construction had not yet begun in earnest. At that time (June 2021), RDA Public Relations Manager Masuzyo Ndholvu announced that ‘[t]o date, the contractor [CJIC] has carried out several preliminary activities such as setting up the construction camps site that is the preparation of designs, identified project-affected persons (PAPS) and property and services that may require to be relocated to pave way for the construction works on the Lusaka–Ndola dual carnage way on the great north road (GNR).” The RDA also said at the time that project would “only resume once the debt situation improves in the country or funds are sourced.’ This statement implies that the China Eximbank either suspended disbursements for the project.   Then, in January 2022, Zambia’s Minister of Infrastructure, Housing Urban and Development Charles Milupi announced that the New Dawn Government was working hard to ensure that the 321 km Lusaka-Ndola Dual Carriageway Project would recommenced by the end of the rainy season with a revised cost that would be substantially less than that negotiated by the previous Patriotic Front (PF) Government. Several months earlier, Milupi said that ‘[o]verpricing, you have to have a benchmark and we are developing a benchmark which is a standard per unit price. That is why I have said very very categorically that no road will cost $1.2 billion, it won’t! As long as I am Minister, as long as this government is in place, as long as President Hakainde Hichilema is in place, there will be no road costing $1.2 billion per kilometer […].’ Then, in February 2022, local media reported that “the contractor [CJIC] who was picked by the previous PF regime to work on the Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway at a cost of US$1.2 billion is back in Zambia and has agreed to do the works at a 50 per cent lower rate.” In response, Zambia Association of Citizen Contractors (ZACCO) General Secretary Danny Simumba stated ‘that the nation deserves to know what exactly has led to the reduction in the amount from the initial one point two billion dollars to five hundred billion dollars.’ He said that ‘in the absence of such information, people would continue speculating that there was corruption in the initial transaction.’   At the time, William Harrington, a former Zambian Minister of Communications and Transport, also said that “[t[his whole matter smells of corruption in a dubiously awarded contract over which the contractor should be summoned for questioning by the [Anti-Corruption Commission] and to show cause why he should not be arrested for what appears to be a dubious scheme to steal money from the people of Zambia in collusion with the former Patriotic Front regime through overpricing.’ Then, on July 29, 2022, Ministry of Finance & National Planning (MOFNP) of Zambia announced that it was seeking lender approval to formally cancel the Jiangxi Bank loan’s undisbursed balance ($157,000,000); however, it also noted that it had not yet secured formal lender approval for this action. This announcement came approximately 21 months after the Government of Zambia defaulted on its repayment obligations to Eurobond holders and approximately 6 weeks after China, France, and 14 other countries formed a creditor committee to discuss the Zambian authorities’ request for a debt treatment under ‘the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the DSSI’ endorsed by the G20 and the Paris Club.","1. The $147 million loan disbursement from China Eximbank for the 321 km Lusaka-Ndola Dual Carriageway Project is captured via Project ID#53037. China Eximbank’s apparent suspension of the loan for the 321 km Lusaka-Ndola Dual Carriageway Project is captured via Project ID#92425. 2. This project is also known as the Lusaka-Kapiri Mposhi-Ndola Dual Carriageway Project and the Upgrade T2 Road from Lusaka to Ndola, 321 km; Luansha-Fisenge Masangano Road, 45 km; Kabwe and Kapiri-Mposhi bypasses. The Chinese project title is 赞比亚卢萨卡至恩多拉高速公路项目 or 卢萨卡至恩多拉高速公路项目. 3. According to the Annual Work Plans of Zambia Road Development Agency, the source of funding for the project was reported to be  China Eximbank, in 2017, in 2018 and 2019, but in 2020 it was reported to be the Bank of China.  This issue warrants further investigation. 4. The RDA 2018 Approved Road Sector Annual Work Plan (RSAWP) shows a disbursement of K1.4 billion ($147 million) for 86 km worth of works under the Lusaka-Ndola Dual Carriageway Project (for the period covering 2018) and it identifies China Eximbank as the source of funding. 5. The China Eximbank loan is not included is not included the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020. Nor is it included it in the China’s Overseas Development Finance Dataset that Boston University's Global Development Policy Center published in December 2020. 6. In 2019, a Zambian parliamentary committee was informed that ‘the contract [for the Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway] was to be financed using the Contractor Financing Initiative (CFI) model of Financing. However, in order to keep the country’s debt at sustainable levels, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) had granted authority to terminate the aforesaid signed contract. The Road Development Agency shall engage the office of the Attorney General to ensure that any litigation costs were avoided.’ CFI is another term for the EPC+F modality. Under most EPC+F contractual arrangements, a loan is extended to the EPC contractor but with a sovereign guarantee from the host government. 7. Jiangxi Bank Co., Ltd. (Jiangxi Bank) is a state-owned commercial bank in China. 8. The $187 million loan is identified by SAIS-CARI and Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center as supporting the ‘Chalala Barracks’ Project (also known as the 6th Regiment Chalala Barracks Project). However, the 6th Regiment Chalala Barracks Project was supported by a $181 million buyer's credit from China Eximbank, which was used to partially finance a $201,391,650 commercial contract between the Ministry of Defense of the Government of Zambia and Jiangxi Zhongmei Engineering Construction Co., Ltd. (as captured via AidData via Project ID#88394). In July 2022, the Ministry of Finance & National Planning (MOFNP) of Zambia disclosed that the $187 million Jiangxi Bank loan was issued to finance approximately 15% of the $1,245,775,986.98 cost of the commercial contract for the 321 km Lusaka-Ndola Dual Carriageway Project between RDA and China Jiangxi Corporation for International Economic and Technical Cooperation, which was signed on May 30, 2017.","# Sector

The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was expected to use the loan proceeds to finance 85% of the cost of a $225 million commercial (EPC) contract between Zambia’s Ministry of Higher Education and China Energy Engineering Group (CEEG), which was signed in August 2017. As of July 2022, the loan from ICBC had achieved a 0% disbursement rate ($0 out of $191,250,000).   The purpose of the project is to construct facilities at two locations of Frederick Titus Jacob (FTJ) Chiluba University (formerly named Luapula University) in the cities of Mansa and Kasama.  China Energy Engineering Group (CEEG) is the general (EPC) contractor responsible for implementation. However, 15 MCC Africa and Ndilia Associates are also involved in the project. In November 2013, the then-President of Zambia, Michael Sata, laid a foundation stone for the construction of the Luapula University which President Edgar Lungu later renamed after late second Republican President Fredrick Titus Jacob Chiluba.   The Government of Zambia handed over the project site in Mansa to contractors in November 2015.  It was originally anticipated that construction would take place between March 2016 and March 2018. However, this project encountered several implementation challenges and delays. Chief among them was the fact that the Government of Zambia decided to suspend construction projects that had achieved a completion rate of 80% or less due to its public financial management problems. However, between July 2019 and December 2019, the Zambian Government undertook an exercise to determine which projects should be canceled or postponed. It was decided at that time that the FTJ Luapula University Construction Project would proceed. However, in April 2020, project implementation stalled again due to funding problems. At that time, the project had only achieved a 5% completion rate.    On April 21, 2020, Zambia’s Minister of Foreign Affairs Joe Malanji wrote to the Chinese Ambassador to Zambia to ask for loan disbursements to be expedited. Joe Malanji emphasized in his letter that the Government of Zambia had already honored its commitment to finance 15% of the total cost of the commercial contract with CEEG (through an advance payment to the contractor). By June 9, 2021, the project component in Mansa had still only achieved a 20% completion rate. According to a 2021 report to Parliament, Zambia’s Ministry of Finance was in negotiations with the contractor to re-scope the project as this would enable the release of the funds by the financier [ICBC]. Then, on July 29, 2022, the Ministry of Finance & National Planning (MOFNP) of Zambia announced that it was seeking lender approval to formally cancel the ICBC loan’s undisbursed balance ($191,250,000); however, it also noted that it had not yet secured formal lender approval for this action.

Then, on July 29, 2022, the Ministry of Finance & National Planning (MOFNP) of Zambia announced that it was seeking lender approval to formally cancel the ICBC loan’s undisbursed balance ($191,250,000); however, it also noted that it had not yet secured formal lender approval for this action. This announcement came approximately 21 months after the Government of Zambia defaulted on its repayment obligations to Eurobond holders and approximately 6 weeks after China, France, and 14 other countries formed a creditor committee to discuss the Zambian authorities’ request for a debt treatment under ‘the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the DSSI’ endorsed by the G20 and the Paris Club.",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,Social Development,"Project focuses on university construction, which is unrelated to energy or environmental impacts","Construction of university facilities in Mansa and Kasama, education sector focus"

In the database of Chinese loan commitments that it released in July 2020, SAIS-CARI records Bank of China rather than ICBC as the source of the $36 million loan for Phase 3. AidData records ICBC as the source of the loan because Chief Government Spokesperson Dora Siliya explicitly identified ICBC as the lender in a 2018 public announcement. 3.
