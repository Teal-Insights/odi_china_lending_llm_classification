There were 20 members of the syndicate that provided the 1.75 billion USD revolving credit facility. Because AidData does not know the exact amount each member of the syndicate contributed, it is assumed each made an equal contribution. 1.75 billion USD / 20 members = 87500000 USD. 2. It is assumed that, when it is reported that the 'guarantor structure' is made up of what appear to all be CEMEX subsidiaries -- CEMEX Concretos, S.A. de C.V., CEMEX Operaciones México, S.A. de C.V., Cemex Innovation Holding Ltd., and CEMEX Corp -- the loan is collateralized against some assets held by, or equity in, these subsidiaries. This is due to the phrasing ('guarantor structure'), as well as the fact that non-English languages often use 'guarantee' to refer to collateralization. 3. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom – United States (New York), with banking and capital markets lawyers; GHR Rechtsanwälte AG (Zurich and Bern) and in-house lawyers advised the borrower.
