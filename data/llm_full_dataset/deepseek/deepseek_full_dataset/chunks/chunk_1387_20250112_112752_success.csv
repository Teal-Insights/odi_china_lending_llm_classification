The original purpose of this project was to rehabilitate the Cairo International Conference Center (CICC or 开罗国际会议中心 or مركز القاهرة الدولي للمؤتمرات), which was constructed during the 1980s with financial support from the Chinese Government, and to build a five-star hotel at or near the CICC). It was originally envisaged that the hotel would cover 20,000 square meters and have 300 rooms. Construction was expected to take 24 months. However, this project appears to have been substantially rescoped and downsized. On May 12, 2008, the Chinese Embassy on Egypt reported that Shanghai Construction Engineering Group (SCG) (上海建工) had signed a project implementation contract with the Egyptian General Authority for Exhibitions (EGAE). The contract stipulated that EGAE would use the proceeds from a previously committed concessional loan to fully finance an RMB 110 million contract with SCG. The purpose of the contract was for SCG to construct Hall 5 (“No. 5 building”, “5th Hall”, or “5号馆”) at the CICC. Hall 5 is a building that covers an area of 13,500 meters^2, and contains a corridor connecting it to the showroom complex on one side and Hall 4 on the other. The display area is 4550 meters^2 and it has a maximum load on its floor of 2.5 tons/sq.m as well as ceiling height of 11 meters. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on December 26, 2008.  Chinese Premier Li Keqiang (李克强) and Egyptian Minister of Trade and Industry, Rachid Mohammed Rachid, participated in the ceremony.   However, construction did not begin until July 20, 2009. According to SCG, it had to evacuate all 13 of its employees working on the CICC — specifically, those constructing Hall 5 — due to large scale demonstrations and riots on February 22, 2011.  However, on November 15, 2011, the project was officially completed and handed over to the local authorities.",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,General Infrastructure,"Project focuses on construction of a conference center hall, which is unrelated to energy or environmental impacts","Construction of Hall 5 at Cairo International Convention Center, no energy or environmental components mentioned"
