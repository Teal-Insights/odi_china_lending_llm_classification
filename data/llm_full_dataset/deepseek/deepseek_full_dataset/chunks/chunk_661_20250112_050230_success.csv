China Construction Bank contributes $364 million to $520 million syndicated loan for 700MW Sumsel-1 Power Plant Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#62064, #69419)

# Description
On January 9, 2017, three Chinese state-owned banks (ICBC Indonesia, China Construction Bank, and Bank of China) and PT Shenhua Guohua Lion Power Indonesia (PT SGLPI) — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture between Shenhua Group Corporation Limited (75%) and PT Lion Power Energy (LPE) (25%) -- signed a syndicated loan agreement for the 700MW Sumsel-1 Power Plant Construction Project. ICBC Indonesia provided $52 million (captured in Project ID#62064), China Construction Bank as the lead arranger provided $364 million (captured in Project ID#69418), and Bank of China provided $104 million (captured in Project ID#69419). The loan carries an interest rate of LIBOR (6M LIBOR in January 2017: 1.34%) plus a 2.4% margin and a maturity length of 15 years. The commitment fee is 0.5%. However, its grace period is unknown. Shenhua Group Corporation Limited issued a corporate guarantee in support of the loan. This $700 million project is being financed with a mix of debt and equity and implemented as an Independent Power Project (IPP) on a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis.  The purpose of the project is to construct a coal-fired power plant — with two, 350MW power generation units (Unit 1 and Unit 2) — in Tanjung Menang Village, Rambang Dangku District, Muara Enim Regency, South Sumatra Province (exact locational coordinates: -3.47666667, 103.99916667). It also involves the construction of an 80 km, 275kV transmission line to Betung substation.   Guangdong Power Engineering Corporation, a subsidiary of China Energy Engineering Group (CEED), is the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. However, Harbin Boiler Company Ltd. (HBC), a subsidiary of Harbin Electric, and Shandong Electric Power Engineering Consulting Institute Co Ltd are also involved in project implementation.
