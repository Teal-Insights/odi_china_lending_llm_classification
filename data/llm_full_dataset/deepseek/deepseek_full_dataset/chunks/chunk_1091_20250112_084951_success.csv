The educational building had classrooms, a teachers’ room, an indoor garden, a cafeteria, a library, a sports hall, and other rooms. There were 21 rehearsal rooms. The residential building consisted of dormitories and rent-free staff apartments. The academy had an area of 9.5 hectares.  The academy was the first institution of higher education in Central Asia to have a full cycle of choreographic education. The academy was designated as a national institution of higher education.

China Eximbank permitted DBK to draw down up to $5 billion from the MFA, which included an unrestricted $1.5 billion loan tranche (captured via Project ID#53547) and a restricted $3.5 billion loan tranche (captured via Project ID#54797). The MFA covered a period of up to 15 years and it prohibited DBK from incurring indebtedness exceeding 25% of its assets or disposing of over 25% of its assets, in addition to a change of control clause favoring China Eximbank. The restricted portion of the MFA was for projects with a ‘Chinese component’ (i.e. involving the purchase of Chinese goods and services), whereas the unrestricted portion was for DBK’s general purposes.   Under the restricted portion of the MFA, on September 29, 2009, DBK entered into an individual buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement (ID#BLA0927) with China Eximbank worth $3.5 billion.
