54783,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides $331.5 million preferential buyer's credit for 312 MW Jujuy Caucharí Photovoltaic Power Plant Project (Linked to Project ID#69556),"On November 27, 2017, China Eximbank and the Republic of Argentina signed a $331,500,000 preferential buyer credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO (2017) 22 TOTAL NO (44) No. (1420303052017212623)] with the Republic of Argentina for the 312 MW Jujuy Caucharí Photovoltaic Power Plant Project. The PBC, which is captured via Project ID#54783, carried the following borrowing terms: a 3% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 15 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 0.75% commitment fee, and a 0.75% management fee.   The Republic of Argentina subsequently entered into an on-lending arrangement — through a subsidiary loan agreement — with the Government of the Province of Jujuy. The ultimate borrower (the Government of the Province of Jujuy) was expected to use the PBC proceeds to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $390 million commercial (EPC) contract between Jujuy State Energy and Mining Society (JEMSE) and Shanghai Electric Power Construction Co. Ltd, which was signed on August 12, 2016 and amended on February 3, 2017. The Government of the Province of Jujuy agreed to fund the remainder (15%) of the commercial contract cost through the issuance of green bonds.   The loan's (principal) amount outstanding was $0 as of December 31, 2018, $311,128,347.77 as of December 31, 2019 and $311,128,347.77 as of December 31, 2020.   This project, which is also known as the Cauchari Solar I, II and III Photovoltaic Parks, involved the installation of 1.2 million solar panels that provide the grid with 312 megawatts of power. Upon completion, the 312 MW complex was expected to generate close to $1 billion in revenue to Jujuy over its first 15 years of operation. It was expected to eventually expand to produce more than 500 megawatts, making it one of the largest solar plants in the world. This photovoltaic park is located in the town of Cauchari.   The provincial energy company, Jujuy State Energy and Mining Society (JEMSE), managed the operation of the solar power complex while construction was executed by Shanghai Electric Power Construction Co. Ltd and Powerchina Ltd. Another Chinese company, Zhongli Talesun Solar Co., Ltd., supplied the 1.18 million solar panels and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. provided the inverters.   On October 6, 2017, a project construction initiation ceremony was held. The project was officially completed on December 7, 2019.   During the G20 Summit in Argentina from November 30 to December 1, 2018, the Government of Argentina and the People's Republic of China agreed to expand the Cauchari Solar Park in Jujuy, Argentina from a 312 MW solar park to a 500 MW solar park. The Export-Import Bank of China reportedly agreed in principle to issue a $170 million loan (captured via Project ID#69556) to the Government of the Province of Jujuy in Argentina for the 200 MW expansion of the Cauchari Solar Park (known as Cauchari IV and V), which would cover 85% of the total ($200 million) cost of the project. If approved, the China Eximbank loan would require a sovereign guarantee from the central (national) government and carry the following borrowing terms: a 3% interest rate, a 3-year grace period, and a 15-year maturity. The loan approval process will reportedly take up to eight months after a power purchase agreement (PPA) is signed with Cammesa, since China Eximbank will require up to four months to approve the loan. Argentina’s national government will also need up to four months to approve the loan, because it comes with a sovereign guarantee which is already included in the 2021 budget. As of November 2020, the Government of the Province of Jujuy was still negotiating the power purchase agreement (PPA) with Argentina’s energy ministry. If the project is financed, it will also reportedly involve the expansion of a transformer station in Cobos and the construction of a 220-kW high-voltage line from the Altiplano substation to the town of La Quiaca. The addition of another 200 MW will also require the installation of 400,000 panels of a new available technology (500 volt instead of the current 330 volts), on an area of 1,200 hectares.",1.

88167,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",Bank of China provides loan for TANGO FLNG Project (Linked with Project ID#88165),"On June 23, 2015, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China ltd (ICBC) and Exmar — a Belgian shipping company that specializes in liquefied gas logistics and storage — signed a $198 million export buyer’s credit agreement for the Caribbean Floating LNG (CFLNG) Project (captured via Project ID#88165). The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown.   The purpose of the project was to build and acquire the world's first floating LNG (FLNG) storage facility. The contractors responsible for the construction of this floating LNG storage facility were Wison (Nantong) Heavy Industry Co., Ltd. and Wison Offshore Engineering Co., Ltd. The FLNG ordered by EXMAR was to be the world’s first floating natural gas liquefaction unit. It was expected to have the functions of natural gas processing, liquefaction and storage, and represents the new generation of offshore units. The unit, which was 95% complete as of March 2015, was originally expected to serve as the gas project of Pacific Rubiales Energy, which is the second biggest oil and gas company of Colombia.  However, in March 2016, Exmar and Pacific Exploration & Production (PEP) agreed to terminate a 15-year tolling agreement (liquefaction and storage agreement) because PEP was facing a possible Chapter 11 filing (bankruptcy). Miguel de Potter, Exmar’s CFO, told a media outlet that the contract termination would limit his company’s exposure to a possible bankruptcy filing by PEP. 'Looking at the latest press releases, we have a fair chance to see that they will default on their [loan] covenant and will sometime end up in a Chapter 11 situation. By terminating the contract, we can open up the vessel to other opportunities,' Potter said. In March 2016, Exmar put out a press release, which said that '[s]ince the execution of the tolling agreement, the domestic natural gas market in Colombia and international LNG market have changed substantially making the liquefaction of LNG in Colombia no longer economic for PEP.' During 2016, the export buyer’s credit agreement with ICBC was also cancelled.  Then, on July 27, 2017, Exmar announced that it had taken delivery of the CFLNG from Wison Offshore & Marine in the People’s Republic of China. The CFLNG consists of a 500,000 tons per year floating liquefaction plant with 16,000 m3 of LNG storage and will remain moored in Wison Shipyard. Then, in August 2018, Exmar agreed to deploy CFLNG as a pilot production system for LNG export in Bahía Blanca, Argentina. A contract was signed by Exmar and the Argentinian Oil and Gas Company (YPF S.A.) on November 20, 2018 and the Caribbean FLNG became the Tango FLNG. Site specific modification and reactivation works were carried out in China, where the Tango FLNG unit was laid up. It was loaded onto a semi-submersible heavy lift vessel (HLV) close to Shanghai in December 2018. In parallel, gas treatment and compression equipment was sourced and procured, and modifications to the jetty were completed. The unit arrived in Bahía Blanca in February 2019. After mooring up, commissioning activities were started, ultimately resulting in the successful delivery of a first LNG cargo on June 6, 2019.  Shortly after the cancellation of the ICBC agreement, Exmar entered into negotiations with Bank of China (BoC). Following the signature of a term sheet in November 2016 with BoC and the approval of terms by the latter’s credit committees in December 2016 and January 2017, Exmar finalized the documentation required to enable parties to sign the credit agreement. The final credit agreement with BoC was subject to the approval of the credit insurer, Sinosure. Exmar originally expected this approval to be available by mid-April 2017. Ultimately, at the end of June 2017, EXPORT Lng Limited -- a 100% subsidiary of EXMAR NV -- signed a $200 million loan agreement with Bank of China (Boc) and Deutsche Bank for the financing of the TANGO FLNG (captured via Project ID#88167). This loan, which was insured by Sinosure, was fully disbursed (drawn down) as of July 27, 2017. The agreement with BoC provides a repayment period of 12 years and the loan bears interest at a rate of six-month LIBOR plus a 3% margin. The yearly estimated debt service amounts to $21.3 million. All obligations of the borrower are guaranteed by EXMAR NV (“guarantor”). There is a requirement for the owner to deposit an amount of $66 million in an escrow account (debt service reserve account).  On February 26, 2020, Bank of China released $40 million from the debt service reserve account. The relaxation of the cash collateral followed the steady operational results of the TANGO FLNG since September 2019, under the 10-years’ charter with YPF S.A. The $40 million was partially allocated to the repayment of the bridge loans and to cover Exmar's capital commitments. TANGO FLNG was performing 20% above its designed capacity in Argentina until May 2020. Since its arrival in 2019 at the Bahia Blanca terminal in Argentina up to May 2020, TANGO FLNG delivered five shipments or 624,000 m³ of LNG to its customer (YPF S.A.) with an availability of 99%.  However, the Argentinian Oil and Gas Company (YPF S.A.) invoked an alleged force majeure during the COVID-19 crisis, stopping all payments to Exmar. The dispute was referred to arbitration and ultimately YPF S.A. and Exmar came to a settlement whereby the 10-year contract for the TANGO FLNG was terminated. YPF S.A. is responsible for paying Exmar a cancellation fee worth $150 million payable over a period of 18 months, with payments secured. The balance of the settlement amount is payable by YPF S.A. in 13 monthly installments backed by a financial security issued by an investment grade counterparty.  Meanwhile, the TANGO FLNG unit has been demobilized from Argentina and stationed in a sheltered location in Uruguay. Since the effective termination of the contract with YPF S.A. in October 2020, marketing is in full swing and, given its status as a fully-proven facility, there is a healthy interest from the market for the redeployment of TANGO FLNG. The fact that the start of 2021 saw increased price levels of oil and gas globally will reportedly benefit the opportunities for reactivation.","1. The China-Latin America Commercial Loans Tracker, which is produced by the Inter-American Dialogue, identifies the CFLNG project as being backed by an active ICBC loan commitment. AidData identifies it as a cancelled loan commitment. The China-Latin America Commercial Loans Tracker does not capture the Bank of China loan for the TANGO FLNG Project.2.  The difference with the registered amount of restricted cash in the statement of financial position can be explained by the debt service account with Bank of China, which is used to service the debt repayment.2. It is unclear how much Bank of China and Deutsche Bank contributed to the $200 million loan agreement that was signed in June 2017. For the time being, AidData assumes equal contribution ($100 million).3. The 6-month LIBOR average for June 2017 (1.064%) was used to calculate the all-in interest rate.
