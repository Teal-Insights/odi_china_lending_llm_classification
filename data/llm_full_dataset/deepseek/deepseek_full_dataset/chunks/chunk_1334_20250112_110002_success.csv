This loan was intended to finance part of the acquisition cost of two ships, one to be purchased by Lae (Hull No. 1234, to be named Los Angeles), and one to be purchased by Namu (Hull No. 1235, to be named Philadelphia). The loan was secured by a first preferred ship mortgage on the vessels, general assignments, charter assignments, operating account assignments, a corporate guarantee from Diana Shipping Inc., and manager's undertakings. The lender was also allowed to require additional security, if at any time the market value of the ships becomes less than the 125% of the aggregate of loan or the swap exposure.

The loan bears interest at LIBOR rate (0.455% as the October 6-months LIBOR in 2010) plus a margin of 2.50% per annum and is calculated at 2.955%.
