The loan has a maturity of 10 years; its other borrowing terms are unknown. The loan is often referred to, in conjunction with a $800 million CDB loan to VEB for a multifunctional complex in Moscow that issued at the same time (as captured via Project ID#66481), as a '$1.2 billion USD loan'.   VEB used the proceeds of the CDB $400 million USD loan to on-lend to the ""Ekibastuz GRES-2"" Joint Stock Company (JSC) for the construction of the third unit of Ekibastuz GRES-2 coal power plant in Ekibastuz. Ekibastuz GRES-2 was a coal-power thermal power plant with an installed capacity of 1 GW, located in the city of Ekibastuz in the north of Kazakhstan. The VEB consortium with the Eurasian Bank of Kazakhstan was to provide a $700 million syndicated loan for the project. The project had a total cost of $700 million. VEB's finances were drained because of its financing of Olympic facilities in Sochi, making it look to CDB to partially finance the project.  ""Ekibastuz GRES-2"" Joint Stock Company (JSC), an energy company located in Kazakhstan, managed the plant. Until December 2019, Russian energy company Inter RAO UES owned 50% and Samruk-Energy (JSC) owned 50% of Ekibastuz GRES-2. In December 2019, Samruk-Kazyna JSC purchased the 50% Inter RAO's shares for $25 million, transferring the plant entirely to Kazakhstan through the management of Samruk-Energy (JSC). Ekibastuz GRES-2 was a coal-power thermal power plant with an installed capacity of 1 GW, located in the city of Ekibastuz in the north of Kazakhstan.  The two existing power units at GRES-2 currently produce about 12% of all electricity produced in Kazakhstan in 2010. The CDB-financed project involved the construction, development and operation of a third unit, which, once completed, would seek to increase the power station’s installed capacity by 50%.
