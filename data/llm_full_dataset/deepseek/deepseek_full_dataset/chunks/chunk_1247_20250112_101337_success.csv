The RMB 1 billion loan tranche (facility) and the $1.34 billion loan tranche (facility) were available to the borrower for draw down over a three year period. The maturity of each loan was 15 years from the date of first draw down and the grace period of each loan was 3 years. The interest rate for the USD-denominated loan tranche was LIBOR plus a 4.20% margin and the interest rate for the RMB-denominated loan tranche was based on the applicable benchmark lending rate published by the People's Bank of China (PBoC).
