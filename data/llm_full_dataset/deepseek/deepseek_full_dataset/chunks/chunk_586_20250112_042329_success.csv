Through an evaluation and negotiation process, China Development Bank (CDB) was selected as the Government of Sri Lanka’s preferred lender based on price and tenor (maturity length).   Then, on October 12, 2018, China Development Bank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed a $1 billion loan agreement (foreign currency term financing facility agreement). The loan (ID# 4510201801100001472) carried the following borrowing terms: an 8-year maturity, a 3.2 year grace period, an interest rate of 5.247 (6-month LIBOR plus a 2.56% margin), and an upfront (management) fee of 1.25% ($6,250,000). Repayment was scheduled to take place in equal semi-annual payments after the end of the 3.2 year grace period. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower (the Government of Sri Lanka) to shore up official foreign reserves and meet outstanding debt obligations (i.e. repay other loans).  The loan fully disbursed on October 17, 2018. Its amount outstanding was $909,100,000 as of June 30, 2022.

On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a ‘pre-emptive’ sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions.
