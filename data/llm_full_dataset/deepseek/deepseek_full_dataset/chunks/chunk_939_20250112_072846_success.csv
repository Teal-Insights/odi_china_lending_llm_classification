89439,BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES,CBR makes RMB 10 million drawdown under currency swap agreement with PBOC in 2015,"On October 13, 2014, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) signed an RMB 150 billion (RUB 1.325 trillion) bilateral currency swap agreement to facilitate trade and improve foreign currency liquidity in Russia. On November 22, 2017, the CBR and the PBOC renewed the currency swap agreement (facility) to RMB 150 billion for a term of three years. On November 22, 2020, the CBR and the PBOC renewed the RMB 150 billion (RUB 1.325 trillion) currency swap agreement (facility) for a further term of three years. The CBR made four (gross) drawdowns under these currency swap agreements: an RMB 10,000,000 drawdown in 2015 (captured via Project ID#89439), an RMB 903,000,000 drawdown in 2016 (captured via Project ID#89440), an RMB 1,144,000,000 drawdown in 2017 (captured via Project ID#89441), and an RMB 891 million drawdown in 2018 (captured via Project ID#89442). The interest rates and maturities that applied to these borrowings are unknown. According to the CBR, the total (principal) amount outstanding under the PBOC currency swap facility was RMB 0 in 2014, RMB 10 million in 2015, RMB 903 million in 2016, RMB 1.144 billion in 2017, RMB 891 million in 2018, RMB 0 in 2019, RMB 0 in 2020, and RMB 0 in 2021.","1. A bilateral currency swap (BCS) agreement — also known as a central bank liquidity swap agreement — is an agreement between the central banks of two countries to exchange cash flows in different currencies at predetermined rates over a specified period of time. Central banks participate in these agreements to facilitate bilateral trade settlements using their national currencies (rather than relying upon on a third-party currency such as the U.S. dollar), manage demands from their local banks, and provide liquidity support to financial markets. The party that draws down on the swap line becomes the borrower and the other party becomes lender. During the term of the swap, the party that draws down on the swap line makes either fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amount. If both parties draw down on the swap line, then both parties exchange fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amounts.  The 5-step process of drawing upon a currency swap line with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) can described from the perspective of an importer in a given country (‘Country X’) seeking to settle trade with a Chinese firm in RMB. Step 1: The central bank of Country X and the PBOC activate their currency swap in advance, at which point each party deposits a specific amount of its currency in an account controlled by the other party (i.e. the central bank of Country X deposits local currency in an account controlled by the PBOC, and the PBOC deposits an equivalent amount in RMB in an account controlled by the central bank of Country X). Step 2: A firm in Country X that imports goods from China applies for an RMB-denominated loan from a domestic bank. Step 3: The domestic bank in Country X that receives the loan application then applies to its central bank for an RMB-denominated loan. After a review process, the central bank of Country X notifies the domestic bank applicant that its loan application was approved. The central bank of Country X subsequently requests that the PBOC transfer RMB funds from the central bank of Country X’s swap account within the PBOC to the loan applicant’s account with a corresponding bank in China. Step 4:  The domestic bank in Country X directs the corresponding bank in China to transfer RMB funds into a Chinese exporter’s account, and the corresponding bank in China provides RMB funds to the Chinese exporter. Step 5: The importer in Country X repays the RMB-denominated loan at its maturity date. The domestic bank notifies the central bank of Country X of the repayment, and transfers RMB into the central bank’s account within the PBOC through the corresponding bank in China. For the central bank of Country X, the RMB deposit is an asset that should be recorded on its balance sheet as an official reserve asset denominated in RMB. The contra entry of this asset is the liability in the local currency of Country X that represents China’s claims in the central bank of Country X. This should be also recorded on the balance sheet of the central bank of Country X. At the time of the exchange of currencies, it should be recorded as an increase in assets and an increase in liabilities of the monetary authorities in the balance of payments. The reason why the PBOC uses this mechanism to provide renminbi liquidity to other central bank is to increase the speed, convenience, and volume of transactions between the two countries. More detailed information about currency swaps with the PBOC can be found at https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021210-print-pdf.ashx and https://thechinaguys.com/the-rise-of-the-renminbi-the-reality-of-bilateral-swap-agreements/ and https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2017/pdf/17-25a.pdf. 2. AidData treats drawdowns under BCS agreements with the PBOC as collateralized loans because, in a BCS arrangement, the currency of the borrower is held as collateral while the lender receives interest on the amount drawn down by the borrower until repayment is made. 3. The CBR is sometimes also referred to as the Bank of Russia. 4. AidData has estimated the annual drawdown amounts by calculating the difference between the overall size of the currency swap agreement and the ‘unused limit’ under the currency swap agreement (facility) in any given year (as identified in CBR Annual Reports). 5. Most central banks publish their end-of-year outstanding PBOC swap debt, but only a few report detailed transaction-level data on drawdowns during the year. Therefore, if no information on drawings is available, AidData assumes that total drawdowns during the reporting period equal the amount outstanding at the end of the reporting period (and vice versa). Since the (de jure) maturities of PBOC swap drawings are 12 months or less, this creates a lower bound estimate for actual drawdowns under the PBOC swap line.  6. PBOC swap debt is frequently rolled over. In central bank reports where one can only observe the year-end outstanding amount, no distinction between rollovers and drawdowns is possible. In these cases, one can derive (new) drawdowns as the difference between the current and last year’s outstanding swap debt stock. This measure essentially captures net lending through the PBOC swap line.","# Sector

Any borrowings undertaken through the facility were expected to carry a maturity of 15 years. VEB intended to on-lend the proceeds from the facility to a project company called CJSC Chek-Su.VK, which would most likely use the on-lent proceeds to finance an EPC (commercial) contract with Sinosteel.   The purpose of the Electrolytic Manganese Production Plant Project is to build a plant for the production of electrolytic manganese in the settlement of Tuim in Khakassia. Electrolytic manganese has a purity of 99.8% and is used for production of special kinds of steel and alloys. The plant would have the capacity to produce 80,000 tons per year of manganese metal, and the output would be sold mainly on the domestic market. As of 2015, Russia’s demand for manganese metal was about 60,000 tons per year. CJSC Chek-Su.VK did not expect serious objections based on environmental concerns in Tuim because the company planned to use modern Chinese technology that has minimal environmental impact; also Tuim had an old nonferrous metals plant that used to produce rolled copper but that had recently been closed, leaving the plant’s workers unemployed.   The total cost of the project was estimated to be 40 billion rubles (about $630 million). The financing of the project was to be provided by the Export-Import Bank of China in collaboration with VEB.
