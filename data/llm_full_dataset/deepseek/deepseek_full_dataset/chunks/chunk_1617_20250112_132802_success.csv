Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility, carried the following borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections. The process was managed by an office in the Angolan Ministry of Finance -- known as Gabinete de Apoio Técnico (GAT) -- that was specifically created to manage the MLFA with China Eximbank.  In March 2005, China Eximbank and the Government of Angola signed a $41,006,416.61 subsidiary buyer’s credit loan agreement for the Huambo and Bié Agricultural School Construction Project. The proceeds of the loan were used to partially finance a $45,562,685.12 commercial contract with Sinohydro, which was signed on March 4, 2005.   Then, on July 19, 2007, China Eximbank entered into another $500 million MLFA with the Government of Angola (captured via Project ID#34030). The MLFA was meant to finance 'complementary actions' to the 2004 MLFA (captured via Project ID#42029). The 2007 MLFA facility financed a total of 18 contracts, which supported projects originally undertaken through the 2004 MLFA. ILAs approved through the 2007 MLFA carried the following borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee. Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank. The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices. Under the July 2007 MLFA, China Eximbank and the Government of Angola signed a $26.55 million subsidiary buyer’s credit loan agreement to support “complementary actions” related to the Huambo and Bié Agricultural School Construction Project.   Project ID#34773 captures the first, $41 million China Eximbank loan that supported this project.   Project ID#34795 captures the second, $26.55 million China Eximbank loan for agricultural schools in Huambo and Bié.  The purpose of the project, which employed 98 Angolan workers and 41 Chinese workers, was to construct two agriculture schools: one in Ndango, Caála within Huambo Province and one in Andulo within Bié Province. The Huambo Medium Agrarian Institute has three two-story buildings each, which serve as dormitories, classrooms, and an administrative area.  There are 15 residences for teachers, a cafeteria with the capacity for 150 people, a health centre, gymnasium, laboratories, a laundry, and kitchen, apart from areas of leisure and soccer fields.  Outside the facility there are 30 hectares of land for practical lessons for students.  The facilities are designed to accommodate 262 students.  The facility has 22 classrooms.  Overall, the school occupies over 10,000 square meters of land.  In the Medium Agrarian Institute (Instituto Medio Agrario) of Bié, there are two classrooms for 50 students, an amphitheater for 30 students, a small classroom for language teaching, and a computer and laboratory room.  There are also three offices, a library and a warehouse. In the classrooms there are chairs, benches, chairs and tables.  Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for implementation. The project was ultimately completed, according to Angola’s Ministry of Finance.  A school inauguration ceremony took place on February 7, 2008. A handover ceremony for the Andulo Agricultural Institute was held on February 5, 2008.","1.

Then, on July 19, 2007, China Eximbank entered into another $500 million MLFA with the Government of Angola (captured via Project ID#34030). The MLFA was meant to finance 'complementary actions' to the 2004 MLFA (captured via Project ID#42029). The 2007 MLFA facility financed a total of 18 contracts, which supported projects originally undertaken through the 2004 MLFA. ILAs approved through the 2007 MLFA carried the following borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee. Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank. The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices. Under the July 2007 MLFA, China Eximbank and the Government of Angola signed a $26.55 million subsidiary buyer’s credit loan agreement to support “complementary actions” related to the Huambo and Bié Agricultural School Construction Project.   Project ID#34773 captures the first, $41 million China Eximbank loan that supported this project.   Project ID#34795 captures the second, $26.55 million China Eximbank loan for agricultural schools in Huambo and Bié.  The purpose of the project, which employed 98 Angolan workers and 41 Chinese workers, was to construct two agriculture schools: one in Ndango, Caála within Huambo Province and one in Andulo within Bié Province. The Huambo Medium Agrarian Institute has three two-story buildings each, which serve as dormitories, classrooms, and an administrative area.  There are 15 residences for teachers, a cafeteria with the capacity for 150 people, a health centre, gymnasium, laboratories, a laundry, and kitchen, apart from areas of leisure and soccer fields.  Outside the facility there are 30 hectares of land for practical lessons for students.  The facilities are designed to accommodate 262 students.  The facility has 22 classrooms.  Overall, the school occupies over 10,000 square meters of land.  In the Medium Agrarian Institute (Instituto Medio Agrario) of Bié, there are two classrooms for 50 students, an amphitheater for 30 students, a small classroom for language teaching, and a computer and laboratory room.  There are also three offices, a library and a warehouse. In the classrooms there are chairs, benches, chairs and tables.  Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for implementation. The project was ultimately completed, according to Angola’s Ministry of Finance.  A school inauguration ceremony took place on February 7, 2008. A handover ceremony for the Andulo Agricultural Institute was held on February 5, 2008.",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,Social Development,"The project focuses on constructing agricultural schools, which are primarily educational and social development initiatives without direct environmental or energy transition impacts","Construction of two agriculture schools with educational facilities, dormitories, and practical training areas; no direct energy or environmental components mentioned"
