The loan terms are unknown. This GCL came into effect on December 28, 2017 and the fist disbursement took place on April 28, 2018.   The borrower was to use the proceeds from these loans to partially finance an EPC contract with China Railway Sixth Bureau Group Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of China Railway Group. The purpose of the project is to construct a 13 km light rail — that travels at 80 km per hour — in the capital city of Hanoi that passes through 12 stations: Cat Linh, La Thanh, Thai Ha, Lang, Thuong Dinh, Vanh Dai 3, Phung Khoang, Van Quan, Ha Dong, La Khe, Van Khe, Yen Nghia. The project officially commenced on October 10, 2011 and the new railway line was originally scheduled to launch in June 2015, but the completion date of the project has been postponed at least four times.  The project has encountered multiple problems and delays during implementation. In 2013, the project faced difficulties related to demolition and relocation, including the fact that the terrain was ideal for machinery and the construction site was close to traffic. Then, in 2014, the total cost of the project increased from $552.86 million to $868.04 million, forcing the Government of Vietnam to contract a supplementary loan from China Eximbank (see Project #63214).  In January 2015, the project faced major criticism from the Vietnamese government for multiple accidents during construction. Vietnamese officials and experts have repeatedly raised concerns about the project’s safety, with several accidents killing or injuring workers and passersby. In early 2016, Vietnam’s Ministry of Transport and China Railway Sixth Bureau Group Co., Ltd agreed on a new launch date in December 2016, before correcting themselves that the line would not be launched until early 2017.
