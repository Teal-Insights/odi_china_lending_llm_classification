(SQM) Share Purchase Agreement with Nutrien, pursuant to which TLC agreed to purchase and Nutrien agreed to sell 62,556,568 Series A shares in SQM at a consideration of approximately $4.07 billion (see Project ID#54940). In addition to its cash on hand, TLC financed the consideration for the SQM Transaction through three bank borrowings.   On October 26, 2018, the Chengdu Branch of China CITIC Bank Corporation Limited signed a $2.5 billion term loan agreement (""Onshore Syndicated Facility Agreement"") with Tianqi Lithium Australia Investments 1 Pty. Ltd. (TLAI1) — a special purpose vehicle and subsidiary of TLC — to support TLC’s acquisition of a 23.77% ownership stake in SQM and thereby help it gain access to a coveted source of supply of metallic lithium, one of the key raw materials for the production of rechargeable batteries for mobile phones and electric vehicles. This $2.5 billion loan is split into a $1.3 billion senior tranche (see Project ID#89508) with a two-year maturity (final maturity date: November 2020) and a $1.2 billion senior tranche (see Project ID#89509) with a three-year maturity (final maturity date: November 2021). The interest rates for these two loans range from LIBOR plus a 2.70% margin to LIBOR plus a 3.70% margin. This $2.5 billion term loan is collateralized against TLC’s 23.77% ownership stake in SQM and a pledge over TLC shares in (i) Shehong Tianqi, (ii) Tianqi Lithium (Jiangsu), (iii) Tianqi Australia Investments 1, (iv) ITS, (v) TLEA, (vi) Chongqing Tianqi, and (vii) Shigatse Zabuye. Moreover, both tranches are backed by a TLC repayment guarantee.   A few days later on October 29, 2018, five banks — China CITIC Bank International, BNP Paribas, China Minsheng Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and Societe Generale — signed a $1 billion mezzanine syndicated term loan facility agreement (""Offshore Syndicated Facility Agreement"") with Tianqi Lithium Australia Investments 2 Pty. Ltd. (TLAI2) — a special purpose vehicle and subsidiary of TLC. China CITIC Bank's and ICBC's combined contribution to this loan is recorded in Project ID#89512. This syndicated loan has a two-year maturity (final maturity date: November 2020). The interest rates for this loan range from LIBOR plus a 2.70% margin to LIBOR plus a 3.70% margin. The $1 billion syndicated mezzanine syndicated term loan is collateralized against an account pledge of ITS, TLC’s 23.77% ownership stake in SQM, and a pledge over TLC shares in (i) Tianqi Xinlong, (ii) Tianqi Australia Investments 2, (iii) TLEA, (iv) Chongqing Tianqi, and (v) Shigatse Zabuye. This loan is also backed by a TLC repayment guarantee.   After signing the agreements, TLAI1 fully drew down on the $1.3 billion senior tranche (known as ‘facility A’) and the $1.2 billion senior tranche (known as ‘facility B’). TLAI2 fully drew down on the $1 billion syndicated mezzanine syndicated term loan (known as 'facility C').   Since the end of 2019, the price of lithium products have been in decline, Tianqi Lithium's liquidity supply began running low, and their debt ratio continued to rise. Therefore, they began having issues meeting their repayment obligations on these three loan facilities. Pursuant to an Amendment and Extension Deed, the parties to the three facilities agreed to (i) extend the maturity dates of facility A and facility C to November 26, 2021, subject to automatic extension to November 25, 2022 upon fulfillment of certain conditions, and (ii) extend the maturity date of facility B to November 29, 2023. On July 2, 2021, the borrowers fulfilled all conditions required referred to in (i) and extended the maturity dates of facility A and facility C to November 25, 2022. The interest rates of the facilities after extension were reset to LIBOR plus 2.00% for each of the facilities, and plus 0.90%, 2.20% and 3.90%, respectively, for facility A, facility B and facility C.   In December 2020, TLC disclosed in a filing to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange that IGO, an Australian miner, had agreed to pay $1.4 billion for a 49% equity stake in Tianqi Lithium Energy Australia, which would give IGO a 25% equity stake in the Greenbushes mine in Western Australia and a 49% holding of the Kwinana lithium processing plant, also in Western Australia. Through the sale, TLC would also be able to make a $1.2 billion principal payment on one of the loans that it raised in October 2018. At the time, TLC was struggling to repay the borrowing, amid challenges that arose after a drop in the price of lithium, as well as a Covid-linked slump in the electric car industry, where lithium-ion batteries are most commonly used. TLC said in a separate filing in December 2020 that it had gained lenders’ consent to extend the outstanding amount of around $1.884 billion on the one year tranches to November 26, 2021. If TLC managed to complete the Australian sale and make the $1.2 billion principal payment, the loan’s final maturity date could be extended further to November 25, 2022. Tianqi also noted in the filing that $416 million of the $1 billion offshore one year tranche was repaid with the proceeds raised from a rights issue in January 2020. TLC also extended the final maturity date of the $1.2 billion three year tranche to November 29, 2023, which carries a further one year extension option. After TLC disclosed in a stock exchange filing on December 1, 2020 that it reached an agreement with the lender syndicate to extend the maturity on the one year tranches to December 28, 2020, Moody’s downgraded it to Caa2 from Caa1, and said that the extension constituted a missed payment default under the rating agency’s definition as the company did not meet its original debt obligation.","1.

After signing the agreements, TLAI1 fully drew down on the $1.3 billion senior tranche (known as ‘facility A’) and the $1.2 billion senior tranche (known as ‘facility B’). TLAI2 fully drew down on the $1 billion syndicated mezzanine syndicated term loan (known as 'facility C').   Since the end of 2019, the price of lithium products have been in decline, Tianqi Lithium's liquidity supply began running low, and their debt ratio continued to rise. Therefore, they began having issues meeting their repayment obligations on these three loan facilities. Pursuant to an Amendment and Extension Deed, the parties to the three facilities agreed to (i) extend the maturity dates of facility A and facility C to November 26, 2021, subject to automatic extension to November 25, 2022 upon fulfillment of certain conditions, and (ii) extend the maturity date of facility B to November 29, 2023. On July 2, 2021, the borrowers fulfilled all conditions required referred to in (i) and extended the maturity dates of facility A and facility C to November 25, 2022. The interest rates of the facilities after extension were reset to LIBOR plus 2.00% for each of the facilities, and plus 0.90%, 2.20% and 3.90%, respectively, for facility A, facility B and facility C.   In December 2020, TLC disclosed in a filing to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange that IGO, an Australian miner, had agreed to pay $1.4 billion for a 49% equity stake in Tianqi Lithium Energy Australia, which would give IGO a 25% equity stake in the Greenbushes mine in Western Australia and a 49% holding of the Kwinana lithium processing plant, also in Western Australia. Through the sale, TLC would also be able to make a $1.2 billion principal payment on one of the loans that it raised in October 2018. At the time, TLC was struggling to repay the borrowing, amid challenges that arose after a drop in the price of lithium, as well as a Covid-linked slump in the electric car industry, where lithium-ion batteries are most commonly used. TLC said in a separate filing in December 2020 that it had gained lenders’ consent to extend the outstanding amount of around $1.884 billion on the one year tranches to November 26, 2021. If TLC managed to complete the Australian sale and make the $1.2 billion principal payment, the loan’s final maturity date could be extended further to November 25, 2022. Tianqi also noted in the filing that $416 million of the $1 billion offshore one year tranche was repaid with the proceeds raised from a rights issue in January 2020. TLC also extended the final maturity date of the $1.2 billion three year tranche to November 29, 2023, which carries a further one year extension option. After TLC disclosed in a stock exchange filing on December 1, 2020 that it reached an agreement with the lender syndicate to extend the maturity on the one year tranches to December 28, 2020, Moody’s downgraded it to Caa2 from Caa1, and said that the extension constituted a missed payment default under the rating agency’s definition as the company did not meet its original debt obligation.",TRUE,NA,GREY,HIGH,Mining (Energy Transition Minerals),"Loan supports acquisition of lithium mining assets, a critical mineral for energy transition technologies","Financing for acquisition of 23.77% stake in SQM, a major lithium producer; lithium is a key material for rechargeable batteries in electric vehicles and mobile devices"

# Description
In May 2018, Tianqi Lithium Corporation (TLC) entered into the Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM) Share Purchase Agreement with Nutrien, pursuant to which TLC agreed to purchase and Nutrien agreed to sell 62,556,568 Series A shares in SQM at a consideration of approximately $4.07 billion (see Project ID#54940).
