The loan was then approved by Gabon's President and Council of Ministers on February 21, 2013. The GCL carries a 20 year maturity and a 2.5% interest rate. The proceeds of the loan were used by the borrower to finance a 2009 commercial contract between Sinohydro Engineering Bureau 4 Co. Ltd and Gabon’s Ministry of Energy and Water Resources and the Ministry of Economy and Trade.   The project involved the construction of a substation in Angondje, the expansion of two substations in Ambowe and Bissegué, and the construction three overhead transmission lines and two underground cable transmission lines measuring 130 km in length.   Sinohydro Engineering Bureau 4 Co. Ltd was the contractor responsible for implementation. Its ultimate objective was to better connect Libreville to surrounding areas. Its work was overseen by the Electricity Office of Energy and Hydraulic Resources Department of the Government of Gabon. The project officially commenced on June 10, 2011. As of May 2014, the new substation in Angondje, the expansion of the two substations in Ambowe (Ntoum) and Bissegué, and the construction of a 23 km underground cable transmission line from Ambowe to Owendo (connecting to the Ambowe-Owendo power plant) were completed. Although this project was completed, it precise completion date is unknown.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Libreville Electricity Network Renovation Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In mid-2014, a decline in international oil prices generated sharp reductions in Gabon’s oil exports and fiscal revenues. The country’s rising fiscal deficit led to the accumulation of arrears to external creditors. By 2017, the stock of the Government of Gabon’s external arrears stood at $115 million, including arrears to China, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Israel, and South Korea. All of these arrears were successfully cleared by 2020. However, the Government of Gabon accumulated $3 million of additional arrears to Chinese creditors in 2020.

The Government's strategy for the clearance of existing external arrears consists of focusing primarily on multilateral debt, bilateral debt, insured commercial commitments and seeking agreements with other creditors prior to the IMF Board meeting. Accordingly, we will clear the arrears vis-à-vis the multilaterals. We will also clear bilateral and commercial-insured arrears as follows: (i) Austria CFAF 6.83 billion (US$12.69 million); (ii) France CFAF 11.9 billion (US$22.11 million); (iii) Israel CFAF 2.23 billion (US$4.13 million); and Spain CFAF 0.09 billion (US$0.17 million).
