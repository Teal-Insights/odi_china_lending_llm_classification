The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to partially finance an EPC contract between PT General Energy Bali and China Huadian Engineering Co. Ltd. According to CDB, $367 million was disbursed through this loan by the end of 2014. The 426MW Celukan Bawang Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project was implemented as an Independent Power Project (IPP) and its total cost ($638 million) was financed with a mix of debt and equity.   The purpose of the project was to install a 426-megawatt (MW) coal-fired power plant — with three 142MW generators (Unit 1, Unit 2, and Unit 3) — in Gerokgak District, Buleleng Regency, Bali Province (exact locational coordinates: -8.1962945, 114.8515677).

China Huadian Engineering Co. Ltd. was also criticized for failing to use local laborers — 90% of the construction workers on the site were apparently foreign workers and some of them were reportedly brought in without proper authorization.  In December 2012, immigration officials seized the passports of 75 illegal foreign workers at the site. In October 2012, members of the Buleleng Regency government threatened to shut down construction at the site until problems were resolved.
