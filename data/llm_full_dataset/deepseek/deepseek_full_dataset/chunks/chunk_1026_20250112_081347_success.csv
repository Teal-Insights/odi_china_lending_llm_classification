92413,ENERGY,"China Eximbank provides $382.8 million preferential buyer’s credit for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project (Linked to Project ID#41917, #41916, #41918)","On January 14, 2014, China Eximbank approved a ‘mixed credit’ worth approximately $6.5 billion for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. China Eximbank agreed to cover 82% of the total project cost, with the Government of Pakistan covering the remaining 18%. This 'mixed credit' arrangement produced four different financial commitments: two preferential buyer's credits (PBC), one government concessional loan (GCL), and one buyer's credit loan (BCL). On January 14, 2014, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed a $382,848,800 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2013) 50 TOTAL NO. (294)]. Its borrowing terms are unknown (captured via Project ID#92413). On February 19, 2014, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed an RMB 2.647 billion government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2014) 5 TOTAL NO. (509)] carrying a 1% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and an 8 year grace period (captured via Project ID#41916). On December 15, 2015, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed a $3,618,151,200 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (15) 18 TOTAL NO. (360) and Government of Pakistan loan ID# PBC-2015-18-360] for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 8 year grace period (captured via Project ID#41918). This agreement was amended on October 8, 2019 [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (15) 18 TOTAL NO. (360) (A)], but the purpose of the amendment is unknown. Additionally, on December 18, 2015, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed a $2.25 billion buyer’s credit loan (BCL) [Government of Pakistan loan ID#BC-BLA201401 and BCL 2015212932] carrying a 6% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 8 year grace period (captured via Project ID#41917).  The Government of Pakistan on-lent some or all of the proceeds of the China Eximbank loans to Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) -- a federally funded independent governmental agency -- at a 15% interest rate. The Government of Pakistan also reportedly issued sovereign guarantees for all four China Eximbank loans that supported the project. In December 2015, the amounts outstanding under all four China Eximbank loans (worth $5.668 billion) were reportedly transferred by the Government of Pakistan to PAEC (as the direct borrower).   The purpose of the project was to construct units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP), which is located in Paradise Point in Karachi within Sindh Province.  China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. It is using Hualon One technology (the CNNC's third-generation nuclear reactor design) to construct Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on November 26, 2013. Then, a major milestone was reached at the K-2 reactor when so-called ‘cold functional tests’ began on November 26, 2019. Cold functional tests are carried out to confirm whether the main system and its supporting facilities are properly installed and ready to operate under high-pressure conditions. K-2 was ultimately connected to the national grid on March 18, 2021. It was officially inaugurated on May 21, 2021 and put into operation on May 24, 2021. The K-3 reactor came online on March 4, 2022. The project was originally expected to reach completion by the end of 2020.  There are some indications that the $382.8 million preferential buyer’s credit for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In May 2019, PAEC sought the Prime Minister's approval to have the interest rates of the China Eximbank loans for Units 2 and 3 of the KANUPP Project reset to their original levels (when they were first issued by China Eximbank). Local sources reported at the time that the electricity tariff determined by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) was set on the basis of actual electricity generation costs and on-lending at a 15% rate increased actual electricity generation costs by PKR 108 billion (necessitating an PKR 1.8/kWh increase in the tariff rate). However, it is unclear if the Prime Minister approved PAEC’s request. Then, on or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the preferential buyer’s credit agreement for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. Then, on November 19, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE1-036]. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2021 under the preferential buyer’s credit for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. Then, on or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement.

The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from July 2021-December 2021 is captured via Project ID#96253.","1. Several media reports suggest that the Government of Pakistan initially insisted that the borrower be a special purpose vehicle (SPV) so that it could keep the K-2/K-3 debt 'off its books'. However, subsequent reporting indicates that the Government of Pakistan is the borrower and that it on-lent the proceeds of at least one China Eximbank loan [the $3,618,151,200 PBC] to Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAE).  2. The China Eximbank loans that supported this project are recorded in the Government of Pakistan's Debt Management Financial Analysis System (DMFAS). However, the fact that the Government of Pakistan issued sovereign guarantees in support of the loans strongly suggests that the proceeds of the three China Eximbank loans were on-lent to PAEC.  3. This project is also known as the Karachi Nuclear Power K-2/K-3 Project and the Karachi Nuclear Power Unit 2 and 3 (EAD) Project. 4. For the time being, AidData assumes that the 2014 PBC and the 2015 PBC carry identical borrowing terms (a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 8 year grace period). 5.

The $20 million of loan financing authorized by IDB was designed to cover on part of the total project cost ($22.25 million). The Government of Panama was expected to provide $2.25 million of counterpart financing.   The IDB approval date for the loan financing was April 16, 2014, and it refers to this project as ‘PN-L1095 : Sustainable Rural Electrification Program in Panama’.   The CHC loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 25-year maturity, a 4.5-year (54-month) grace period, a 0.75% commitment (credit) fee, no management fee, and an annual interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 0.09% funding margin (also known as the ‘Bank’s Cost of Funding’) and a 0.85% IDB lending spread. As of August 26, 2021, the CHC loan had achieved a 15.2% disbursement rate (with $1,522,564 out of $10,000,000 being disbursed).   As of December 31, 2020, $8,158,683 of the $10 million IDB loan had been disbursed (to Panama National Bank, account No. 10000187105). The Rural Electrification Office (Oficina de Electrificación Rural, OER), attached to the Ministry of the President (Ministerio de la Presidencia) was responsible for project execution. The overall objective of the program is to increase access to sustainable electricity services in rural areas. It is hoped the project will result in a rural electrification coverage rate of approximately 71% by 2016 and is expected to directly benefit 40,300 people. These objectives are being met through three different components.    The first is rural electrification through the extension of networks. This will be accomplished through payments of subsidies to private distributors, which had been receiving concession contracts since October 2013. These one-time subsidies were to cover the cost of investment in the infrastructure, while the private distributors would cover operation and maintenance costs. It was estimated in the loan contract's Anexo Único that 6,126 homes, 45 schools, and 10 health centers would be granted access to electricity with this step. $9,123,173 of the China Co-Financing Fund loan specifically, and $15,682,325 of the total project cost, was budgeted for this component.   The second component, with $4,436,475 of the total project cost budgeted, is the expansion of the coverage of sustainable electricity service from photovoltaic systems and other renewable technologies for isolated areas in Panama, with a particular focus on areas with significant indigenous populations. An estimated 4,218 families, 62 schools, 11 health centers, and 14 regional congresses are expected be served through this component, per the loan contract's Anexo Único. Isolated systems are typically constructed and administered by an operator selected through a competitive bidding process, at which point the government provides a subsidy to the chosen operator for the system's construction and administration. These operators are typically specialized, and the construction processes have the participation of civil society, small companies, NGOs, electricity cooperatives, and/or user organizations. The loans captured in this project will finance the subsidies typically provided by the government. $370,027 of the China Co-Financing Fund loan specifically was budgeted for this component.   The third component involves institutional strengthening of the OER. This was accomplished through providing financing to the OER for tools for planning and management, community promotion and development, selection of alternative energy sources, and system design. Additionally, technical support was provided to the OER through information technology and training regarding different program elements such as the calculation of subsidies. Of the China Co-Financing Fund loan, $506,800 went to institutional strengthening and program administration (with 414,000 for strengthening and training and 92,800 for audits). It was $2,131,200 of the total project cost in the budget.   The project was planned to take four years to complete, 2014-2018. However, at the end of 2020, several projects had yet to be completed. It appears the first part of the project to begin construction was the isolated systems (component two) for the Panamá, Herrera, and Los Santos provinces, having begun execution by the end of 2015 and had reached 40% completion by the end of 2016. In Peñón, construction for 56.6 km of electric lines began on December 3, 2015, and was complete in August 2017. By November 2017, 8.2 km had been completed in Bajo Cedro, Chiriquí Grande district, and on By October 2018, portions of the project in the following provinces were in execution: Veraguas, Panamá Oeste, Los Santos, Herrera, Chiriquí, Coclé, and Bocas del Toro.

This will be accomplished through payments of subsidies to private distributors, which had been receiving concession contracts since October 2013. These one-time subsidies were to cover the cost of investment in the infrastructure, while the private distributors would cover operation and maintenance costs. It was estimated in the loan contract's Anexo Único that 6,126 homes, 45 schools, and 10 health centers would be granted access to electricity with this step. $9,123,173 of the China Co-Financing Fund loan specifically, and $15,682,325 of the total project cost, was budgeted for this component.   The second component, with $4,436,475 of the total project cost budgeted, is the expansion of the coverage of sustainable electricity service from photovoltaic systems and other renewable technologies for isolated areas in Panama, with a particular focus on areas with significant indigenous populations. An estimated 4,218 families, 62 schools, 11 health centers, and 14 regional congresses are expected be served through this component, per the loan contract's Anexo Único. Isolated systems are typically constructed and administered by an operator selected through a competitive bidding process, at which point the government provides a subsidy to the chosen operator for the system's construction and administration. These operators are typically specialized, and the construction processes have the participation of civil society, small companies, NGOs, electricity cooperatives, and/or user organizations. The loans captured in this project will finance the subsidies typically provided by the government. $370,027 of the China Co-Financing Fund loan specifically was budgeted for this component.   The third component involves institutional strengthening of the OER. This was accomplished through providing financing to the OER for tools for planning and management, community promotion and development, selection of alternative energy sources, and system design. Additionally, technical support was provided to the OER through information technology and training regarding different program elements such as the calculation of subsidies. Of the China Co-Financing Fund loan, $506,800 went to institutional strengthening and program administration (with 414,000 for strengthening and training and 92,800 for audits). It was $2,131,200 of the total project cost in the budget.   The project was planned to take four years to complete, 2014-2018. However, at the end of 2020, several projects had yet to be completed. It appears the first part of the project to begin construction was the isolated systems (component two) for the Panamá, Herrera, and Los Santos provinces, having begun execution by the end of 2015 and had reached 40% completion by the end of 2016. In Peñón, construction for 56.6 km of electric lines began on December 3, 2015, and was complete in August 2017. By November 2017, 8.2 km had been completed in Bajo Cedro, Chiriquí Grande district, and on By October 2018, portions of the project in the following provinces were in execution: Veraguas, Panamá Oeste, Los Santos, Herrera, Chiriquí, Coclé, and Bocas del Toro.    As of December 31, 2020, nine separate contractors had been paid by project funds.",TRUE,NA,GREEN,HIGH,Solar Power,"Primary focus is on rural electrification through renewable energy technologies, particularly photovoltaic systems, with significant budget allocation for sustainable electricity services","Expansion of coverage through photovoltaic systems and other renewable technologies, focus on isolated areas with indigenous populations, significant budget allocation for renewable energy components"
