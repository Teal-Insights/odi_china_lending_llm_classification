[The Government of Tonga’s] balance sheet also faces a currency risk as about 61 percent of the outstanding external debt is denominated in Chinese renminbi.’ Due to concerns about Tonga’s level of public debt exposure, the repayment terms of the China Eximbank loan for Phase 3 of the National Road Improvement Project were rescheduled (through a 5-year grace period extension) in 2013 (as recorded in Project ID#64929). As as result of the rescheduling, the borrower agreed to make semi-annual principal repayments between March 21, 2020 and March 21, 2030",1.

The Turkish government also issued a sovereign guarantee.  The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance a $680 million EPC contract with China National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation (CATIC) and China Power Investment Power Engineering Company Ltd (CPIPEC). The purpose of the project was to construct a 1,200-megawatt (MW) coal-fired power plant (with two, 600 MW power generating units) in the İskenderun 1st Organized Industrial Zone (OSB) near the village of Azganlık, which is located with İskenderun district and Hatay province.  The plant was designed to supply power to two steel plants that are also operated by Diler Holding: Diler iron and steel plant and Yacizi Iron and Steel plant. The project was financed and implemented on an independent power project (IPP) basis.   Hubei Construction (湖北省工业建筑集团有限公司), CATIC (or AVIC International or 中航国际), CPIPEC (中电投电力工程有限公司), Atlas Energy, and Elektrik Üretim A.Ş were all involved in project implementation. In December 2008, Atlas Enerji Üretim A.Ş. received environmental permits to build the power plant.  The power was later suspended due to investment issues and it relaunched in 2010. Construction began on November 10, 2011. The first 600MW unit was commissioned in August 2014 and the second 600MW unit was commissioned in December 2014. The power plant achieved its commercial operation date (COD) on December 19, 2014.",TRUE,NA,BROWN,HIGH,Coal Power,"Primary purpose is coal-fired power generation, which is environmentally harmful and inhibits energy transition","1,200 MW coal-fired power plant, two 600 MW coal power generating units, designed to supply power to steel plants"
