The Chinese project title is Majnoon油田一体化油田管理服务合同. 3. The monetary value of the earlier 2018-2021 oilfield management service contract was $300 million. The value of the 2021-2024 oilfield management service contract (and deferred payment agreement) is unknown, but it is almost certainly greater than $300 million since (a) Anton Oilfield Services Group was given an expanded scope of work, and (b) Sinosure provided $500 million of credit insurance coverage. For the time being, AidData assumes that the monetary value of the deferred payment agreement is $400 million. However, this issue requires further investigation.4. In a typical receivables financing agreement (or deferred payment agreement), the company that the project owner in the host country has selected as its engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor is also a lender to the project owner. The company assigns receivables under its EPC contract with the project owner to one of or more banks. Upon assignment of receivables, the bank or banks will release funds to the company so it can discharge its obligations under the receivables financing agreement  as a lender. Receivables financing is also known as accounts receivable financing (finance) or A/R financing (finance) or 应收账款融资 (in Chinese). These other terms are used because the accounts receivable of a company (i.e., unpaid invoices) are being used as collateral to unlock working capital—typically in the form of a bank loan (‘receivables loan’). Sellers often face cash flow problems when their buyers do not make full payment at the due date of the invoice. A receivables financing arrangement addresses this problem by allowing them to sell their outstanding invoices to a bank at a discounted rate. This approach allows the seller to receive the remaining invoice amount before the due date of the invoice. The bank either gets its money back at invoice maturity through the seller (acting as a collecting agent) or directly from the debtor.5. More likely than not, a Chinese state-owned bank signed an accounts receivable transfer agreement with Anton Oilfield Services Group to provide financing for the construction period of the project. In this type of arrangement, the exporter (seller) procures insurance from Sinosure and transfers its accounts receivable under the insurance policy to a bank. The bank then grants financing to the exporter (seller) and becomes the insured under the transferred insurance policy. When an insured loss occurs, Sinosure pays indemnity to the financing bank pursuant to the insurance policy and the Accounts Receivable Transfer Agreement. The question of whether a Chinese state-owned bank signed an accounts receivable transfer agreement with Anton Oilfield Services Group requires further investigation.6. The Majnoon Oil Field is a super-giant oil field located 60 km (37 mi) from Basra in southern Iraq. Majnoon is one of the richest oil fields in the world with an estimated 38 billion barrels of oil in place. The field was named Majnoon which means crazy in Arabic in reference to excessive amount of oil in a dense area.","# Sector

95984,EDUCATION,Government of Iraq secures oil-backed loan for Construction of 1000 Schools Project (Linked to Project ID#95982),"On May 11, 2018, China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) and the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Iraq signed an export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement (contract ID# FA-IRAQ-001). Under the terms of the 20-year agreement, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Iraq is authorized to borrow up to $10 billion (or an equivalent amount in other currencies such as RMB) via subsidiary buyer’s credit facility agreements with PRC banks and/or commercial contracts with deferred payment clauses (i.e. supplier’s credits) with Chinese companies (exporters) for projects in the ‘oil, gas, energy, infrastructure, communications, education, healthcare or electricity sectors’ that are ‘located in the areas in Iraq deemed safe by the Embassy of China and the Government of Iraq.’ All borrowings under the framework agreement, which is captured via Project ID#95982, must carry maturity lengths that do not exceed 15 years and they must be backed by an approved credit insurance policy from Sinosure. The framework agreement also specifies that the Government of Iraq is responsible for making advance payments worth no less than 15% of the total cost of the underlying commercial contracts supported by the subsidiary buyer’s credits and supplier’s credits.  To repay and secure these borrowings, the framework agreement specifies that a Crude Oil Sales Agreement between Iraq's state-owned oil marketing company (SOMO or شركة تسويق النفط) and an unspecified Chinese oil importer, wherein SOMO agrees to sell no fewer than 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day to the Chinese oil importer and the Chinese oil importer agrees to make payments to SOMO due under the Crude Oil Sales Agreement by depositing U.S. dollars (or another foreign currency) in a Sinosure-designated and lender-controlled bank (escrow) account (that is opened on behalf of the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Iraq to facilitate debt repayment).  Under the terms of the framework agreement, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Iraq is required to maintain a minimum cash balance of $100 million in a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) and pledge the DSRA in favor of Sinosure. Apart from the DSRA, the framework agreement refers to two additional escrow accounts: an Oil Settlement Account and a Repayment Account. All oil sale proceeds first flow to the Oil Settlement Account. Then, after deductions are made by the United Nations Compensation Commission for compensation due to Kuwait, the remaining revenue flows to the Repayment Account (so long as there is still a $100 million minimum cash balance in the DSRA) and principal and interest payments to lenders are made from the Repayment Account.   On September 23, 2019, account agreement and oil agreement annexes to the framework agreement were finalized. Then, on September 23, 2019, the framework agreement officially went into effect. Approximately 15 months later, in December 2020, a Financial Advisor to Iraq’s Prime Minister, Dr. Mudhar Muhammad Salih, told the Iraqi News Agency (INA), that Iraq’s House of Representatives would need to identify the specific projects to be funded under the framework agreement and allocate funds for these projects in the Federal Budget Law. He also signaled at the time that the Iraqi Government planned to borrow through the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure to fund the construction of school buildings. Then, in June 2021, he announced that the 2021 Federal Budget Law included $2 billion for projects to be financed through the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure, which had entered into force. 5 months later, in November 2021, he told a local newspaper that several Chinese companies had deposited $1.8 billion in an account and the funds would be used to support the construction of 1,000 schools as well as ‘infrastructure and renewable power projects’. This announcement implies that the Government of Iraq ultimately decided to borrowed via commercial contracts with deferred payment clauses (i.e. supplier’s credits) with Chinese companies rather than buyer’s credit facilities with PRC banks. On June 30, 2022, Dr. Mudhar Muhammad Salih said that ‘[t]he operations of depositing money and withdrawing from the [escrow] account are continuing for the benefit of the projects concluded within the [export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure].’ He also noted that ‘the [escrow] account is managed very carefully by the Central Bank of Iraq, and the financial operations are audited by the major international financial auditing companies.’  There are three known projects — supported by four separate commercial contracts — that are being financed under the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure: the Construction of 1000 Schools Project, the Al-Nasiriyah International Airport Renovation and Expansion Project, and the 1260MW Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant Construction Project. On May 25, 2021, the Government of Iraq signed a $1.3 billion commercial contract with PowerChina for the construction of 679 schools in various parts of Iraq and a $600 million commercial contract with Sinotec for the construction of 321 schools in various parts of Iraq. The estimated monetary value of the supplier’s credit(s) for the Construction of 1000 Schools Project is $1.615 billion (as captured via Project ID#95984).  Each school will be 3,000 m2, with 12-24 classrooms, 5 rooms for electronic and laboratory work, and a meeting room. The schools will reportedly be located in the following governorates: Baghdad (144 schools), Dhi Qar (106 schools), Nineveh (92 schools), Basra (86 schools), Salah al-Din (78 schools), Diwaniyah (61 schools), Diyala (56 schools), Muthanna (53 schools), Maysan (52 schools), Wasit (48 schools), Babil (45 schools), Karbala (44 schools), Kirkuk (44 schools), Najaf (40 schools), and Anbar (51 schools). PowerChina and Sinotec are the contractors responsible for project implementation.  Construction began on or around October 20, 2021 and 100 schools were complete by April 2022. The construction of the remaining 900 schools was scheduled for completion by the end of 2022. The Government of Iraq also reportedly contracted PowerChina and Sinotec to build 3,000 schools in 2023 and 4,000 units in 2024 (after the completion of the Construction of 1000 Schools Project). However, as of September 2022, it was unclear if the construction of the additional 7,000 schools would be financed through the export credit insurance cooperation framework with Sinosure.","1.

Government of Iraq secures oil-backed loan for Al-Nasiriyah International Airport Renovation and Expansion Project (Linked to Project ID#95982)

# Description
On May 11, 2018, China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) and the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Iraq signed an export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement (contract ID# FA-IRAQ-001). Under the terms of the 20-year agreement, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Iraq is authorized to borrow up to $10 billion (or an equivalent amount in other currencies such as RMB) via subsidiary buyer’s credit facility agreements with PRC banks and/or commercial contracts with deferred payment clauses (i.e. supplier’s credits) with Chinese companies (exporters) for projects in the ‘oil, gas, energy, infrastructure, communications, education, healthcare or electricity sectors’ that are ‘located in the areas in Iraq deemed safe by the Embassy of China and the Government of Iraq.’ All borrowings under the framework agreement, which is captured via Project ID#95982, must carry maturity lengths that do not exceed 15 years and they must be backed by an approved credit insurance policy from Sinosure. The framework agreement also specifies that the Government of Iraq is responsible for making advance payments worth no less than 15% of the total cost of the underlying commercial contracts supported by the subsidiary buyer’s credits and supplier’s credits.  To repay and secure these borrowings, the framework agreement specifies that a Crude Oil Sales Agreement between Iraq's state-owned oil marketing company (SOMO or شركة تسويق النفط) and an unspecified Chinese oil importer, wherein SOMO agrees to sell no fewer than 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day to the Chinese oil importer and the Chinese oil importer agrees to make payments to SOMO due under the Crude Oil Sales Agreement by depositing U.S. dollars (or another foreign currency) in a Sinosure-designated and lender-controlled bank (escrow) account (that is opened on behalf of the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Iraq to facilitate debt repayment).  Under the terms of the framework agreement, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Iraq is required to maintain a minimum cash balance of $100 million in a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) and pledge the DSRA in favor of Sinosure. Apart from the DSRA, the framework agreement refers to two additional escrow accounts: an Oil Settlement Account and a Repayment Account. All oil sale proceeds first flow to the Oil Settlement Account. Then, after deductions are made by the United Nations Compensation Commission for compensation due to Kuwait, the remaining revenue flows to the Repayment Account (so long as there is still a $100 million minimum cash balance in the DSRA) and principal and interest payments to lenders are made from the Repayment Account.  On September 23, 2019, account agreement and oil agreement annexes to the framework agreement were finalized. Then, on September 23, 2019, the framework agreement officially went into effect. Approximately 15 months later, in December 2020, a Financial Advisor to Iraq’s Prime Minister, Dr. Mudhar Muhammad Salih, told the Iraqi News Agency (INA), that Iraq’s House of Representatives would need to identify the specific projects to be funded under the framework agreement and allocate funds for these projects in the Federal Budget Law. He also signaled at the time that the Iraqi Government planned to borrow through the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure to fund the construction of school buildings. Then, in June 2021, he announced that the 2021 Federal Budget Law included $2 billion for projects to be financed through the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure, which had entered into force. 5 months later, in November 2021, he told a local newspaper that several Chinese companies had deposited $1.8 billion in an account and the funds would be used to support the construction of 1,000 schools as well as ‘infrastructure and renewable power projects’. This announcement implies that the Government of Iraq ultimately decided to borrowed via commercial contracts with deferred payment clauses (i.e. supplier’s credits) with Chinese companies rather than buyer’s credit facilities with PRC banks. On June 30, 2022, Dr. Mudhar Muhammad Salih said that ‘[t]he operations of depositing money and withdrawing from the [escrow] account are continuing for the benefit of the projects concluded within the [export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure].’ He also noted that ‘the [escrow] account is managed very carefully by the Central Bank of Iraq, and the financial operations are audited by the major international financial auditing companies.’  There are three known projects — supported by four separate commercial contracts — that are being financed under the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure: the 1260MW Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant Construction Project, the Construction of 1000 Schools Project, and the Al-Nasiriyah International Airport Renovation and Expansion Project.  On June 8, 2021, the Government of Iraq and China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) signed a $367 million commercial (EPC) contract for the Al-Nasiriyah International Airport Renovation and Expansion Project. The estimated monetary value of the supplier’s credit for the project is $311.95 million (as captured via Project ID#95985). The Al-Nasiriyah International Airport Renovation and Expansion Project involves (a) the expansion and renovation of an international airport (with a 5000 square meters freight building) in the town of Nasiriyah that, upon completion, will have the capacity the handle 750,000 travelers a year; and (b) the construction of a 25 kilometers long road linking the airport and the Dhi Qar governorate center. The airport served as an Iraqi Air Force base (also known as Talil Air Base) until 2011, after which it served U.S. forces as the Imam Ali Air Base until March 2017. CSCEC is the contractor responsible for project implementation.
