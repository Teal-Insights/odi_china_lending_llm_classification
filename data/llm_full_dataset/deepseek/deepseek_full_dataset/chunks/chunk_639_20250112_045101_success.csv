The project, which was originally expected to created 100 permanent jobs and 300 temporary jobs, involves the asphalting of a 61.23 km road from Agboville to Cechi via Rubino; the asphalting of a 5.5 km Ananguié ramp; the asphalting of the 3 km Rubino road; and the asphalting of the 3 km Céchi road. The ultimate purpose of the project is to facilitate economic activity between Agboville and Adzopé and the other towns in the center of Ivory Coast (Dimbokro, Yamoussoukro, Bouaké). The 61.23 km Agboville-Rubino-Céchi road is considered by a key link in the development of country’s eastern coast region because it will facilitate the delivery of agricultural products to the local markets of Agboville and Adzopé and other towns (Dimbokro, Yamoussoukro, Bouaké). The road runs parallel to a railway line and constitutes a second mode of transportation for people and goods in the area.  CRBC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. The project was formally launched on September 4, 2015. However, project implementation did not commence until April 23, 2016. The project was originally scheduled for completion in April 23, 2018. However, as of October 31, 2017, the project was running 13 months behind schedule. The project had achieved a 34.14% physical completion rate as of October 31, 2017. According to the AMP, by January 6, 2021, the Rubino-Cechi section of the 61.23 km road from Agboville to Cechi was ‘accepted’ by the local authorities; however, a toll station had still not been built.",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,General Infrastructure,Project focuses on road construction and asphalting without clear environmental or energy transition impacts,"61.23 km road asphalting project, economic development focus, no energy or environmental components mentioned"
