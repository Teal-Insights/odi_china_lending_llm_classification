The agreement stipulated that China Eximbank would provide a concessional loan worth up to RMB 250 million to the Government of Cambodia (with a 2% interest rate and 20 year maturity). The agreement was signed with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen during his 5-day visit to China (19-23 April 2004).

The proceeds of the GCL were used by the Government of Cambodia to on-lend to a private company called AZ Distribution Co Ltd (also known as AZ Communication Company and Azcom) —  headed by a ruling party (CPP) parliamentarian named Ung Bun Hauv (Ung Bun Hov) — in order to establish a new mobile phone service in Cambodia. AZCOM was then supposed to use the loan proceeds to finance a $30 million commercial contract that it signed with with Huawei Technologies on September 28, 2005.  The purpose of the project and the commercial contract was to supply and install CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) equipment and thereby support Azcom’s expansion efforts.
