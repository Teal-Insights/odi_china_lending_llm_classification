33726,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides $480 million loan for China-Laos Railway Project (Linked to Project ID#85304),"In December 2016, Lao-China Railway Company (老中铁路有限公 or LCRC) — a joint venture between three Chinese state-owned enterprises that collectively hold a 70% ownership stake and one Lao state-owned enterprise that owns a 30% ownership stake — signed a build-operate-transfer (BOT) concession agreement with the Government of Laos for the China-Laos Railway Project. The total cost of the project was $5.9 billion (RMB 37.4 billion) and it was financed according to 60:40 debt-to-equity ratio ($3.54 billion of debt and $2.36 billion of equity).  LCRC directly secured $3.54 billion (RMB 22.45 billion) of debt financing from the Export-Import Bank of China in June 2019 (captured via Project ID#85304), and the Government of Laos and the Chinese Government jointly contributed $730 million and $1.63 billion of equity financing, respectively, for the project. The $3.54 billion debt financing package was reportedly secured by (collateralized against) an equity pledge, an asset mortgage, and a franchise pledge.  In order to make its $730 million equity contribution to the project, the Government of Laos secured a $480 million loan from China Eximbank (captured via Project ID#33726) and it agreed to provide $250 million of its own funding (in annual installments). China Eximbank and the Government of Laos signed the $480 million loan agreement on September 8, 2016. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 2.3%, maturity period of 25 years, and a grace period of 5 years. The Government of Laos did not issue a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan, but it did pledge revenues from a bauxite mine and three potash mines in Laos as sources of collateral to secure the loan. An intergovernmental framework agreement on November 13, 2015 preceded the signing of this loan agreement.  The purpose of the project was to construct a 418 mile long railway segment that connects Kunming, the capital city of southwestern China’s Yunnan Province, with Laos’ capital city of Vientiane. This railway segment passed through the capital of Vientiane and the four Laotian provinces of Luangnamtha, Oudomxay, Luang Prabang, and Vientiane. It was part of a larger Kunming-Singapore Railway Project (also known as the Kunming-Singapore Trans Asian Railway Corridor), which starts from Kunming and ends in Singapore after passing through Laos, Thailand, and Malaysia.  The single-track electrified rail line has a designed speed of 160 km/hour and it is being built in standard gauge. 47% percent of the railway passes through 75 tunnels and 15% passed over viaducts spread over 167 bridges. There were 32 planned stations along the route, and according to the Ministry of Public Works and Transport of Laos, 50 meters of land on either side of the tracks was reserved for the railway's developers. The final station was Thanaleng station. Xay Village in Xaythany District was to be the site of Vientiane Station, the largest station on the railway. Upon completion, the Laos-China Railway was expected to reduce the time necessary to travel from Mohan-Boten to Vientiane from three days to less than three hours. According to a 2012 feasibility study, the internal rate of return (IRR) of the project was projected to be 4.56%. Sinohydro Corporation, Power Construction Corporation of China, China Railway No. 5 Group, China Railway No. 2 Group, and China Railway No. 8 Group were the contractors responsible for implementation.   The formal start of works was announced in December 2015. However, progress was initially slow due to unresolved property issues as well as detailed design works. A groundbreaking ceremony did not take place until December 25, 2016. (Note: An earlier groundbreaking ceremony was abandoned in 2011 after reports emerged that China was demanding large land concessions along the railway line in return for funding its construction.) Large scale implementation began in the summer of 2017. By mid-2018, the project had achieved a 20% completion rate. Then, on March 27, 2020, the first 500-meter-long track segment was successfully laid in Vientiane. Construction of the Vientiane Railway Station commenced on July 3, 2020.   Railway infrastructure was reportedly 90% complete as of July 2020. On October 6, 2021, the China-Laos railway station opened in Vientiane. The project was completed on October 12, 2021, and was put into commercial use later in December 2020. Then, on October 16, 2021, the first train made its public debut in Vientiane, ahead of a test run. The originally expected project completion date was December 2, 2021. The opening ceremony for the China-Laos Railway Project, which was attended (via video link) by Chinese President and President of Laos Thongloun Sisoulith, was held on December 3, 2021.","1. This project is also known as the Construction of the Lao Section of the Kunming–Singapore Railway Project, the Boten-Vientane Railway Project, the Mohan-Vientiane Section of China-Laos Railway Project, and the Kunming-Vientiane High-Speed Railway Construction Project.

63448,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides $162.35 million preferential buyer's credit for 230kV Nabong-Nam Ngum 1-Hin Heup Power Transmission Line Project,"In August 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Laos signed a preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement worth approximately $162.35 million for the 230kV Nabong-Nam Ngum 1-Hin Heup Power Transmission Line Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was to use the proceeds of the PBC to partially finance a $191 million commercial (EPC) contract between China National Heavy Machinery Corporation (CHMC) and Électricité du Laos (EDL), which was signed on July 28, 2014.   The purpose of the project was to construct 1 new substation, extend two existing substations, and construct a a 90-kilometer dual-circuit transmission line from Hinheup (Hin Heup) substation to Nabong substation via Nam Ngum 1 Substation. The project sought to evacuate power from the Nam Ngum 1 Hydropower Station Extension and other new-built hydropower stations in the northern part of Laos. It also sought to stabilize the power supply in the capital city of Vientiane.   CHMC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation.  Construction began in November 2016 and was project completed and put into operation in May 2018. The project was completed 18 months ahead of the schedule specified in the EPC contract. A formal project completion ceremony took place on July 4, 2018. Then, on September 2, 2019, EDL issued a performance certificate to CHMC, which marked the end of the project warranty period.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the N230kV Nabong-Nam Ngum 1-Hin Heup Power Transmission Line Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. Laos’ gross foreign exchange reserves were dangerously low between 2019 and 2021, hovering between 1.4 and 2.3 months of import cover, and total public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt increased from 68 percent of GDP ($12.5 billion) in 2019 to 88 percent in 2021 of GDP (or $14.5 billion). According to a report published by the World Bank in April 2022, ‘[t]he energy sector, mostly represented by Électricité du Laos (EDL), accounted for over 30 percent of total PPG debt in 2021. […] EDL’s debt service obligations [were] still unsustainable [at the time], with future debt service accounting for about two fifths of EDL’s total operating revenue.’ The Laotian authorities sought and secured debt service payment deferrals from their Chinese creditors in 2020 and 2021; according to the World Bank, ‘[d]ebt service deferrals granted by major lenders in 2020-2021 amounted around 3.6 percent of GDP in 2021’ and ’[a]s a result, actual debt service payments are estimated to have declined to 48 percent of total revenues in 2021, compared to 65 percent in the 2021 [Government of Laos] plan.’  The country’s central bank (Bank of the Lao P.D.R) also made a $300 million drawdown under its currency swap agreement with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in June 2020 — when its gross reserves stood at only 1.5 months of import cover and credit rating agencies warned of a high default probability. Then, in 2021, the short-term emergency loan from the PBOC was ‘rolled over’ for another year. Around the same time, a Chinese state-owned enterprise purchased a major public infrastructure asset in Laos—a large part of the country’s electricity transmission grid—from EDL as part of an apparent debt-for-equity swap. China Southern Power Grid Co. and EDL established a joint venture known as Électricité du Laos Transmission Company Limited (EDLT) in September 2020.  China Southern Power Grid Co. purchased a 90% ownership stake in EDLT in exchange for a $600 million fee (equity infusion). Then, in March 2021, EDLT signed a 25-year concession agreement, which made it responsible for management of the country’s high-voltage transmission network above 230 kilovolts. Independent observers suggested at the time that EDL would likely use the $600 million upfront payment from China Southern Power Grid Co. to service its outstanding debts to Chinese creditors, although this has not been independently confirmed. According to the World Bank’s International Debt Statistics, the Government of Laos was responsible for making average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $232 million between 2019 and 2019 and average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $60 million between 2020 and 2021 (a substantially lower figure due to payment deferrals); however, it expected to make average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth nearly $678 million over the next seven years (2022-2028).","1.

The precise face value of the PBC is unknown. However, per China Eximbank’s policy of using PBCs to finance up to 85% of the cost of commercial (EPC) contracts, AidData assumes that the face value of the PBC for the 230kV Nabong-Nam Ngum 1-Hinheup Power Transmission Line Project is equivalent to 85% of $191 million.  3.

[…] EDL’s debt service obligations [were] still unsustainable [at the time], with future debt service accounting for about two fifths of EDL’s total operating revenue.’ The Laotian authorities sought and secured debt service payment deferrals from their Chinese creditors in 2020 and 2021; according to the World Bank, ‘[d]ebt service deferrals granted by major lenders in 2020-2021 amounted around 3.6 percent of GDP in 2021’ and ’[a]s a result, actual debt service payments are estimated to have declined to 48 percent of total revenues in 2021, compared to 65 percent in the 2021 [Government of Laos] plan.’  The country’s central bank (Bank of the Lao P.D.R) also made a $300 million drawdown under its currency swap agreement with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in June 2020 — when its gross reserves stood at only 1.5 months of import cover and credit rating agencies warned of a high default probability. Then, in 2021, the short-term emergency loan from the PBOC was ‘rolled over’ for another year. Around the same time, a Chinese state-owned enterprise purchased a major public infrastructure asset in Laos—a large part of the country’s electricity transmission grid—from EDL as part of an apparent debt-for-equity swap. China Southern Power Grid Co. and EDL established a joint venture known as Électricité du Laos Transmission Company Limited (EDLT) in September 2020.  China Southern Power Grid Co. purchased a 90% ownership stake in EDLT in exchange for a $600 million fee (equity infusion). Then, in March 2021, EDLT signed a 25-year concession agreement, which made it responsible for management of the country’s high-voltage transmission network above 230 kilovolts. Independent observers suggested at the time that EDL would likely use the $600 million upfront payment from China Southern Power Grid Co. to service its outstanding debts to Chinese creditors, although this has not been independently confirmed. According to the World Bank’s International Debt Statistics, the Government of Laos was responsible for making average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $232 million between 2019 and 2019 and average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $60 million between 2020 and 2021 (a substantially lower figure due to payment deferrals); however, it expected to make average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth nearly $678 million over the next seven years (2022-2028).","1.

Per China Eximbank's policy of allowing borrowers to use GCLs to finance the full cost of EPC contracts, AidData assumes the face value of the GCL was $198,827,000. The GCL was almost certainly denominated in RMB, but AidData was not able to identify the face value of the GCL or the EPC contract in RMB. This issue merits further investigation.","# Sector

# Title
China Eximbank provides $198.8 million government concessional loan for 230KV Thavieng S/S-Laksao S/S and 115 KV Nam Phay HPP-Thongkoun2 S/S Transmission Lines Project

# Description
In May 2016, China Eximbank and the Ministry of Finance of Laos signed a $198,827,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the 230KV Thavieng S/S-Laksao S/S and 115 KV Nam Phay HPP-Thongkoun2 S/S Transmission Lines Project. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance a $198,827,000 commercial (EPC) contract between Électricité du Laos (EDL) — the state corporation of Laos that owns and operates the country's electricity generation, electricity transmission and electricity distribution assets — and NORINCO.   The purpose of the 230kv Thavieng S/S-Laoksao S/S Transmission Line, with a total length of 220 km, was to transmit electricity from Thavieng Substation in XiengKhuang Province to Laksao Substation in Bolikhamxai Province and further to connect the Central 1 with the Central 2 regional power networks as well as to connect other possible local networks in Laos, and also to transmit power to Nakadok Mining area.   The purpose of the 115kv Nam Phay HPP-Thongkoun2 S/S Transmission Line, located in Xaysomboun Province, was to transmit the electric power generated by Nam Phay Hydropower Plant to Thongkoun 2 Substation, constituting trunk line system linked within Central 1 Regional Power Network that secures power stability with improving quality of electricity. This transmission line is of double circuit, and the total length is 45km.  The construction of the line sought to ensure that power generated by Nam Phay Hydropower Station, which is jointly invested by NORINCO International and Electricité du Laos, would be reliably delivered to the power grid of Laos and realize the expected investment returns.   NORINCO was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. On June 7, 2017, Minister of Energy and Mines of Laos Dr. Khammany Inthirath visited the 230kV Thavieng-Laksao Transmission Line project site. A project completion ceremony took place on September 14, 2018.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the  230KV Thavieng S/S-Laksao S/S and 115 KV Nam Phay HPP-Thongkoun2 S/S Transmission Lines Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.
