The loan was secured by (i.e. collateralized with) the fertilizer plant that Vinachem developed with the loan proceeds. The Government of Vietnam also issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the China Eximbank PBC.   The Ninh Binh Nitrogenous Fertilizer Plant Construction Project was co-financed by Vinachem, Ninh Binh provincial government, and Vietnam Development Bank.   The purpose of the project was to construct a nitrogenous fertilizer plant (coal-based urea production plant) in Ninh Phuc Industrial Zone within Ninh Binh province. Upon completion, the plant was expected to provide the domestic market with 560,000 tons of urea fertilizer per year.

The plant ended its operations in July 2016.  Then, on April 18, 2017, the Ministry of Industry and Trade issued an official letter (No. 3285 / BCT-HC), announcing that Vinachem was not generating enough cash flow to meet its repayment obligations related to the China Eximbank loan for the Ninh Binh Nitrogenous Fertilizer Plant Construction Project. The plant resumed operations on January 22, 2018 at 80 percent of its designed capacity. However, its indebtedness and lack of access to working capital put its long-run solvency in jeopardy.

The project has encountered multiple problems and delays during implementation. In 2013, the project faced difficulties related to demolition and relocation, including the fact that the terrain was ideal for machinery and the construction site was close to traffic. Then, in 2014, the total cost of the project increased from $552.86 million to $868.04 million, forcing the Government of Vietnam to contract a supplementary loan from China Eximbank (see Project #63214).   In January 2015, the project faced major criticism from the Vietnamese government for multiple accidents during construction. Vietnamese officials and experts have repeatedly raised concerns about the project’s safety, with several accidents killing or injuring workers and passersby. In early 2016, Vietnam’s Ministry of Transport and China Railway Sixth Bureau Group Co., Ltd agreed on a new launch date in December 2016, before correcting themselves that the line would not be launched until early 2017. In February 2017, the railway line’s completion was postponed for another year, with a new launch set for February 2018.   In February 2017, the first set of trains (out of 13 total) was installed on the track . Each train is worth $63.2 million, and manufactured by China's Beijing Subway Rolling Stock Equipment Ltd. In 2018, the project manager submitted a proposal for the railway line to begin a test run in September 2018, setting the date for an official launch to be in 2021.

# Title
China Eximbank provides an RMB 1.2 billion government concessional loan for Cat Linh-Ha Dong Light Rail Construction Project (Linked to Project ID #63214, #34616)

# Description
On May 30, 2008, the Chinese Government and and the Government of Vietnam signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the Cat Linh-Ha Dong Light Rail Construction Project. This subsequently produced three different loan agreements:   (1) On October 22, 2008, China Eximbank and the Vietnam Ministry of Finance signed an RMB 1.2 billion ($169 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL No.(14) Total No.(223)] for this railway project (Project #73326). The borrowing terms of the GCL were as follows: 3% interest rate, 15-year maturity, and 5-year maturity.   (2) On November 8, 2009, China Eximbank and the Vietnam Ministry of Finance signed a $250 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC No.2009 (24) Total No. (86)] for this railway project (see Project #34616). The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: 4% interest rate, 15-year maturity, and 5-year maturity.   (3) On May 11, 2017, China Eximbank and the Vietnam Ministry of Finance signed an RMB 1.678 million ($250.62 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL No.2017 (24) Total No. (629)] for this railway project (see Project #63214). The loan terms are unknown. This GCL came into effect on December 28, 2017 and the fist disbursement took place on April 28, 2018.  The borrower was to use the proceeds from these loans to partially finance an EPC contract with China Railway Sixth Bureau Group Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of China Railway Group. The purpose of the project is to construct a 13 km light rail — that travels at 80 km per hour — in the capital city of Hanoi that passes through 12 stations: Cat Linh, La Thanh, Thai Ha, Lang, Thuong Dinh, Vanh Dai 3, Phung Khoang, Van Quan, Ha Dong, La Khe, Van Khe, Yen Nghia.

The loan carried the following (estimated) borrowing terms: a 17.75-year maturity, a 6.25-year grace period, and a 3.5% interest rate. VDB on-lent the proceeds of the loan to a special purpose vehicle (SPV) known as Vietnam Infrastructure Development and Finance Investment Joint Stock Company (VIDIFI) — a joint venture (JV) of Vinaconex, Vietnam Development Bank (51% ownership stake), Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Foreign Trade of Vietnam (VCB) (29% ownership stake) and a consortium consisting of Bitexco Corporation and the Saigon Investment Joint Stock Company (VCB) (20% ownership stake) — that owns and operates the expressway through a Build, Operate, and Transfer (BOT) arrangement with the Government of Vietnam. In total, VDB and VCB reportedly provided 70% and 30% of the debt financing, respectively, that VIDIFI needed to implement the $2 billion (VND 45.5 trillion) project. Other external financiers of the project included Export–Import Bank of Korea ($200 million), KfW Development Bank ($100 million), Citibank Japan, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, The Sumitomo Trust & Banking, and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UF. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) of Vietnam issued a sovereign guarantee to VIDIFI.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 105.5 km, six-lane highway that begins at the Belt Road 3 in Ha Noi, the capital city of Vietnam, runs through Hung Yen, Hai Duong, the two major provinces in northern Vietnam, and ends at Dinh Vu port in Hai Phong. It connects the existing highways at six points, enhancing access to Dinh Vu Port, the biggest seaport in the country. This project was designed as an A-grade road with a total length of 105.5 kilometres including seven grade-separated junctions, 17 large-size bridges, 25 medium-size bridges, and 22 over-bridges. A crossing was designed with six 3.75 meters-lanes for cars that can handle automobiles traveling 120 km per hour and two emergency stopping-lanes.   China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) was one of the contractors responsible for project implementation. However, several other contractors were involved. The construction contract for the project was awarded to SK C&C, the system integration subsidiary of SK Group. The company imported Korea’s cutting-edge traffic system for the project. It also installed a robust monitoring system, which collects data from tollhouse systems, vehicle detecting machines, traffic scoreboards and closed-circuit TVs, and sends it to the central management office of the expressway, enabling real-time monitoring of traffic volume on the expressway.  Meinhardt International in association with Japan Engineering Consultants provided the construction supervision services. Hadicon was engaged in conducting survey and design works for three packages of the expressway for a total length of approximately 30km. Joton was the supplier of traffic paints for the project.   A pre-feasibility study of the project was developed in 2003 by TEDI and invested by Bien Dong Project Management Unit (Bien Dong PMU). However, Bien Dong PMU could not mobilize enough investment capital for project delivery. In 2007 the Prime Minister approved the feasibility study of the project under a BOT model and VIDIFI was assigned to be the project company.  A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on May 19, 2008. However, construction did not begin until February 2, 2009. One month earlier, in January 2009, Vietnam’s Ministry of Planning and Investment granted an investment license for the project. The first (22.7 km) section of the expressway was opened in May 2015.
