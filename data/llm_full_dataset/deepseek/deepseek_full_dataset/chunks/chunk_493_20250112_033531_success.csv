On December 20, 2018, the Government of Ecuador’s Ministry of Finance and Economy and China Development Bank (CDB) entered into a $900 million facility (loan) agreement consisting of two tranches. Tranche A, which is captured via Project ID#59014, is a $675 million loan tranche that can be used by the borrower for ‘eligible projects.’ Tranche B, which is captured via Project ID#59015, is an RMB 1.53 billion ($236,782,800) loan that can be used by the borrower for ‘eligible projects’ involving approved contractors.

Tranche B originally carried the following borrowing terms: a 6.2% interest rate, a 6-year maturity, and a 2-year grace period.   Tranche A and Tranche B were originally scheduled for equal, quarterly repayments. Both tranches were to be repaid with and secured by (collateralized against) the proceeds from Petroecuador oil sales (deposited in a bank account that is accessible to the lender). More specifically, the proceeds from the sale of oil were to be paid into a Proceeds Account, which was opened by Petroecuador with CDB. Petroecuador was required to maintain a minimum cash balance in its Proceeds Account with CDB. The proceeds from oil sales to PetroChina and Unipec are also to be paid into a separate Proceeds Account, which was opened by Central Bank of Ecuador (BCE) with CDB.
