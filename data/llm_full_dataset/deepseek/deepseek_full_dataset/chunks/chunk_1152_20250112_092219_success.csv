The purpose of the project was to rehabilitate the Abidjan Palace of Culture — a venue used for large-scale performances such as plays, concerts, exhibitions, and conferences — in the capital city of Abidjan. The building is situated between the Houphouët-Boigny Bridge and the General de Gaulle Bridge. It occupies a 17,000 square meter space and includes a 1,500-seat indoor theater and a 2,800-seat outdoor theater. The Abidjan Palace of Culture was originally built with financial support from the Chinese government during the 1990s but was severely damaged during the 2010-2011 post-election crisis.  Qingjian Group was the contractor responsible for implementation of the rehabilitation project. Beijing Architectural Design and Research Institute was responsible for the design of the project. Works were scheduled to last 24 months and end in June 2015. Qingjian Group was awarded a MOFCOM contract in 2012. Project implementation officially commenced on May 9, 2013. However, construction did not begin until June 18, 2013. The project was completed twenty days ahead of schedule on May 28, 2015. It was then handed over to the Ivorian authorities on June 20, 2015. An Abidjan Palace of Culture reopening ceremony took place on July 31, 2015. Then, in 2017, the Chinese Government provided a CFA 50 million grant to the Government of Cote d'Ivoire’s Ministry of Culture and Francophone to help manage and furnish the Palace (as captured via Project ID#61030).",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,Social Development,Project focuses on cultural infrastructure rehabilitation without direct environmental or energy transition impacts,"Rehabilitation of cultural performance venue, no energy or industrial components mentioned"
