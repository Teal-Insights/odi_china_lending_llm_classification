56916,HEALTH,Chinese Government provides grant for Chinese Medical Team Housing Project,"On December 20, 2001 an exchange of letters was signed between China and Cabo Verde for the Chinese Medical Team Housing Project. In 2002, the China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) provided a grant to the Government of Cabo Verde for this project. The monetary value of this financial commitment is unknown. However, it is known that the Chinese Government committed EUR 1.9 million for this project and the Praia Central Hospital Surgical Ward Construction Project (captured in Project ID#53192). Therefore, for the time being, AidData estimates that MOFCOM evenly divided the funds across the two projects (committing EUR 950,000 to each project).   The Chinese Medical Team Housing Project involved the construction of housing units for Chinese medical teams stationed at Agostinho Neto Hospital (HAN or Praia Central Hospital or 普拉亚中心医院) in the capital city of Praia. The construction area occupied about 750 square meters.   On June 25, 2003, five Chinese engineers arrived in Praia to make preparations for the implementation of the project. Construction began on December 2, 2003. Then, from August 18-26, 2004, five Chinese experts carried out a mid-term project inspection on behalf of MOFCOM and found its implementation to be excellent. On August 30, 2005, the project was officially completed handed over to the Government of Cabo Verde. The Chinese Ambassador to Cabo Verde Sun Rongmao and Director General of International Cooperation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Anthony Alves Lopez signed the project handover certificate on behalf of the governments of China and Cabo Verde.","The Chinese project title is 建设中国医生住房 or 中国医生住房. The Portuguese project title is Construcao da Residencia para a Equipe Médica Chinesa. AidData could not identify any evidence from the Chinese Government or the Government of Cape Verde that this project was supported by a loan. Therefore, it is coded as a grant-financed project for the time being. However, MOFCOM refers to the project as being supported by ‘aid’, which in principle could be a grant or interest-free loan. This issue merits further investigation.","# Sector
