The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 17-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and an annual interest rate of 6-month EURIBOR plus a 1.75% margin. It also appears to be supported by a Sinosure credit insurance policy.  As of December 31, 2020, the loan had achieved a 0% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 162.5 billion).   The purpose of the project is construct a 75MW hydroelectric dam on Bini a Warak located in the Adamawa Region of Cameroon. The project involves the construction of a reservoir, tunnels, powerhouses, substations, 70 km, 225 kilovolts (kV) electricity transmission (energy evacuation) lines, 30kv rural electricity transmission lines, access roads, and related infrastructure, the installation of generators, turbines and related equipment. The project initially took shape in 2008 as a result of a US Trade and Development grant (worth $662,000), which established the viability of the project.   Delphos International was appointed as the feasibility study consultant, and an environmental and social impact assessment was conducted by Naldeo and Alpha Technologies Inc. Then, after the signing of a memorandum of understanding in 2012, a commercial contract for the project was signed in 2013 between Ministère de l'Eau et de l'Energie du Cameroun (MINEE) and Sinohydro Corporation. The final project design was completed in November 2013, and construction began in October 2017. Preparatory works, site installation activities, access road construction activities, and dyke construction activities were completed by the end of 2018.  However, the project underperformed and stalled in 2019. In November 2019, the Government of Cameroon paid XAF 4 billion in outstanding credit insurance fees (presumably to Sinosure), which it had hoped would unlock loan disbursements from ICBC. However, ICBC did not respond by releasing any loan disbursements. Project implementation was also at a 'standstill' for much of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of November 2020, the project had only achieved a 9% completion rate. It was rescheduled for completion in 2024.   Then, during his address before the National Assembly on June 28, 2021, Cameroonian Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the project. He noted that it had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.' As of December 2021, Cameroon’s MINEE was still negotiating with ICBC to try to facilitate the resumption of project implementation (which is dependent upon ICBC making an advance payment to Sinohydro). Several project milestones were also accomplished in 2021: the implementation activities of the Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) and the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) of the transmission line were completed; and decrees were issued to facilitate payment of compensation to the people affected by the project. Upon completion, it is expected that the 560hm3 dam will have installed energy capacity of 75 MW and a 225Kv energy transmission line.","1. The Chinese project title is 比尼瓦拉克水电站工程 or WARAK水电站项目. The French project title is Le projet de construction du barrage de Bini à Warak (75 MW) or Projet d'aménagement du barrage hydroélectrique de Bini à Warak or Projet d'Aménagement Hydroélectrique de Bini à Warak. 2. One source suggests that the loan commitment date was July 30, 2016 rather than January 15, 2016. This issue merits further investigation. 3. In the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020, it does not record the borrowing terms of this loan. AidData records the borrowing terms that are identified in the Government of Cameroon's 2017 Debt Management Strategy and a March 2021 publication of the Government of Cameroon’s Caisse Autonome d'Amortissements. Also, SAIS-CARI identifies the face value of the loan as $289 million, but the Government of Cameroon's Caisse Autonome d'Amortissements and the Government of Cameroon's Development Assistance Database (DAD) indicates that the face value of the loan is $302,944,727. AidData records the face value that is reported in the DAD. 4. The project ID number for this transaction in DAD is CAM/001023. 5. Although several sources refer to this project being ‘suspended’, this appears to be a layman’s explanation for ICBC’s unwillingness to release an advance payment to Sinohyrdro. For the time being, AidData is treating this project as one that is backed by an official commitment and undergoing implementation (since negotiations over ICBC loan disbursements are evidently still underway). However, the status designation of this project will need to be revisited once these negotiations come to a close. 6. The ‘all-in’ interest rate was calculated using the average 6-month EURIBOR in July 2016 (-0.188% + 1.75% = 1.562%). 7. One source suggests that a commercial contract with Sinohydro was signed on September 2, 2019. It is unclear if this is an amendment of the commercial contract that MINEE and Sinohydro signed in 2013. This issue warrants further investigation.","# Sector

Then, on August 11, 2016, China Unicom and CAMTEL signed a Construction and Maintenance Agreement (C&MA) for the South Atlantic Inter Link (SAIL) Cable Project, which established a special purpose vehicle (SPV) called the South Atlantic Inter Link Consortium (南大西洋国际海底光缆组织). China Eximbank subsequently signed a loan agreement worth approximately RMB 3.06 billion with South Atlantic Inter Link Consortium (南大西洋国际海底光缆组织) — a joint venture between China Unicom and CAMTEL — for the 5900 km South Atlantic Inter Link (SAIL) Cable Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the total cost (RMB 3.6 billion) of the project (including a commercial contract with Huawei Marine Networks Co., Limited that was signed on June 27, 2017). The remainder (15%) of the project cost was to be financed by China Unicom, Huawei Marine Networks Co., Limited and CAMTEL.   The purpose of the project was to lay a 5900 km submarine internet cable -- called the South Atlantic Inter Link (SAIL) -- from Kribi, Cameroon to Fortaleza, Brazil. SAIL was expected to become the first intercontinental fast direct submarine cable spanning the South Atlantic Ocean and connecting the African and South American continents. The SAIL cable system was designed to be a fast and direct path, utilizing the industry leading 100G transmission technology and to deliver a design capacity of 32 Tbps, through a 4 fiber pair configuration. Huawei Marine Networks Co., Limited was the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. However, China Unicom also provided project management and business operations support. The submarine fiber optic cable for the project was manufactured in Norway, but other equipment was produced in China. Project Implementation commenced in October 2015. By September 29, 2017, the project had achieved a 60% completion rate. The drawing of the first meter of the submarine cable took place in Kribi, Cameroon on May 22, 2018. September 4, 2018 marked the completion of all cable-laying work. The SAIL cable was put into commercial operation on November 15, 2018. This project was originally scheduled for completion by the end of the third quarter of 2018.","1.

The purpose of the project was to lay a 5900 km submarine internet cable -- called the South Atlantic Inter Link (SAIL) -- from Kribi, Cameroon to Fortaleza, Brazil. SAIL was expected to become the first intercontinental fast direct submarine cable spanning the South Atlantic Ocean and connecting the African and South American continents. The SAIL cable system was designed to be a fast and direct path, utilizing the industry leading 100G transmission technology and to deliver a design capacity of 32 Tbps, through a 4 fiber pair configuration. Huawei Marine Networks Co., Limited was the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. However, China Unicom also provided project management and business operations support. The submarine fiber optic cable for the project was manufactured in Norway, but other equipment was produced in China. Project Implementation commenced in October 2015. By September 29, 2017, the project had achieved a 60% completion rate. The drawing of the first meter of the submarine cable took place in Kribi, Cameroon on May 22, 2018. September 4, 2018 marked the completion of all cable-laying work. The SAIL cable was put into commercial operation on November 15, 2018. This project was originally scheduled for completion by the end of the third quarter of 2018.",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,General Infrastructure,Project focuses on communications infrastructure without direct environmental or energy transition impacts,"5900 km submarine internet cable, communications sector, no direct energy or environmental components"

In 2015, MOFCOM reported that an intergovernmental framework agreement for the project had been signed in Beijing but was still awaiting the Cameroonian President’s authorization of the loan agreement before the project could officially commence. On July 27, 2016, the Cameroonian President issued a decree authorizing the Cameroonian Minister of the Economy, Planning, and Regional Development to sign a loan with China Eximbank for the E-National Higher Education Network Project. Then, on August 22, 2016, China Eximbank and the Republic of Cameroon signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2015) 11 TOTAL NO. (550)] worth RMB 937,500,000 for the E-National Higher Education Network Project. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: a maturity of 20 years, a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2%, a default (penalty) interest rate of 0%, a commitment fee of 0.25%, and a management fee of 0.25%. The borrower agreed to deposit project-related revenues in a special account to facilitate repayment.   The proceeds of the GCL were to be used by the borrower to finance a $150,000,000 commercial contract between the Ministry of Higher Education of the Republic of Cameroon and Sichuan Telecom Construction Engineering Co., Ltd, which was signed on February 20, 2013 (as well as the Complementary Agreement and Complementary Agreement II that the two parties signed on November 26, 2013 and April 8, 2014, respectively). The first loan disbursement (worth 30% of the face value of the loan) was released on June 5, 2017. As of December 31, 2020, the loan had achieved a 80.7% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 4.9 billion). The loan’s outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 72.1 billion as of December 31, 2020.   The purpose of the project is to facilitate the establishment of a computer network for higher education, and to provide a digital campus development center for eight universities in Cameroon. The first component of this project is a 'one child, one computer' initiative, for which China is providing Cameroon students with 500,000 laptops. This component of the project costs 50 billion FCFA, and it was expected to be complete by 2019. The second component of the project involves the construction, equipment and commissioning of nine University Digital Development Centers (one in each State University and one at the Cameroon-Congo Inter-State University, Sangmelima Campus). This part of the project costs 25 billion FCFA, and together both components are worth 75 billion FCFA (which is equivalent to the total amount of the project and the total amount financed by China Eximbank). Project implementation commenced on November 26, 2017. As of July 2021, project implementation was still underway.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the E-National Higher Education Network Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.

Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed).
