The loan from Petrochina provided for an interest rate of 7.08% (previously 7.25% under the 2009 oil pre-payment facility) and a six-month grace period against delivery of six oil shipments of 360,000 barrels from the Oriente field (i.e. a total of 2.16 million barrels) each month, and another two shipments of 360,000 barrels of crude from the Napo field (i.e. a total of 720 barrels) each month also, with a possible volume variation of 5% (up or down) to be decided by PetroEcuador. The loan had a two year maturity. The oil pre-payment facility from 2009 is captured via Project ID#35863.   Then, in July 2017, the Office of the Comptroller General headed by Dr. Pablo Celi announced pursuant to Acuerdo 024-CG-2017 its intention to conduct a ‘Special Audit’, as authorized by Ecuadorian law to examine acts of public entities. The Special Audit examined the sources and uses of various financings, and whether those financings were completed in accordance with the relevant applicable laws, regulations and policies. The Office of the Comptroller General in the CGR Audit Report conclude concluded that certain rules that defined the Government of Ecuador’s methodology to calculate public debt were replaced with laws and regulations that allowed for discretion in the application and use of certain concepts related to public debt and, specifically, that the amounts of advance payments pursuant to certain commercial agreements providing for the advance payment of a portion of the purchase price of future oil deliveries should have been categorized as public debt and included in the calculation of the public debt to GDP ratio. The CGR Audit Report also set forth some conclusions and recommendations regarding certain interinstitutional agreements between the Ministry of Economy and Finance and Petroecuador, and found deficiencies in the filing of debt documentation.

A loan amortization table is provided in Annex 8 of the 2011 prepayment facility agreement. 2. A pre-export finance (PXF) facility is an arrangement in which a commodity producer gets up-front cash from a customer in return for a promise to repay the customer with that commodity (possibly at a discount) in the future. PXF funds may be advanced by a lender or syndicate of lenders to a commodity producer to assist the company in meeting either its working capital needs (for example, to cover the purchase of raw materials and costs associated with processing, storage and transport) or its capital investment needs (for example, investment in plant and machinery and other elements of infrastructure). PXF facilities are usually secured by (1) an assignment of rights by the producer under an ‘offtake contract’ (i.e., a sale and purchase contract between the producer and a buyer of that producer of goods or commodities), and (2) a collection account charge over a bank account into which proceeds due to the producer from the buyer of the goods or commodities under the offtake contract are credited. There are two key documents in prepayment finance transactions: a contract providing for the advance payment by the offtaker to the producer for the purchase of goods/commodities (the 'Prepayment Contract'), and a loan agreement between a lender and the offtaker (the 'Offtaker Loan Agreement') under which the advance payment is financed.","# Sector

The loan consisted of a discretionary component of $1.4 billion (Tranche A) and an RMB 4 billion (approximately $652,360,403.03) oil-related component (Tranche B). Tranche A, which is captured via Project ID#69319, carried the following terms: a 7.159% interest rate, a 3% default (penalty) interest rate, a 2 year grace period, and an 8 year maturity. The proceeds of Tranche A were freely available to the borrower for its discretionary use. Tranche B, which is captured via Project ID#69320, carried the following terms: a 6.253% interest rate, a 3% default (penalty) interest rate, a 3 year grace period, and an 8 year maturity.   The loan agreement was backed by a separate Oil Sales and Purchase Contract between PetroEcuador and PetroChina. The agreement requires PetroEcuador to sell, over the entire validity period of the Facility Agreement, at least 72,000 barrels of crude oil per day and/or fuel oil to PetroChina. Petroecuador’s selling price to PetroChina was calculated based on the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil. The proceeds from the sale of oil were to be paid by PetroChina into a Proceeds Account, which was opened by PetroEcuador with CDB in China. Petroecuador was also required to maintain a minimum cash balance in the Proceeds Account, equivalent to 130% of the principal and interest due to be paid in that interest period.   The discretionary component (Tranche A) of the facility agreement funded projects including the Delsitanisagua Hydroelectric Power Plant (Project ID#58591), Quijos Hydroelectric Plant (Project ID#39060), Mazar Dudas Dam (Project ID#58593), the Villonaco Wind Farm (Project ID#39063), the Esmeraldas II Thermal Power Plant (Project ID#60794), and the ECU-911 Project (Project ID#39281).

Both Tranches A and B were repaid in full ahead of schedule on September 27, 2018. The Government of Ecuador made principal and interest payments worth $262 million on September 27, 2018. It also paid a $4.6 million prepayment fee for Tranche A. No prepayment fee was required for Tranche B. The Government of Ecuador’s decision to repay the loan ahead of schedule reduced pressure on the public treasury by $91.63 million in December 2018, $90.05 million in March 2019, and $90.05 million in June 2019.

From 2010 to 2016, the Government of Ecuador entered into four separate loan agreements with China Development Bank totaling $7 billion which are related to a multi-party contractual structure that involves crude oil delivery contracts entered into with PetroChina and Unipec. Deliveries under these contracts are based upon international spot prices, such as WTI plus or minus a spread, plus a premium paid due to the term of the contracts. The spread is calculated using Argus, a crude oil price assessment publication (“Argus”) and the quality of crude oil as measured by the American Petroleum Institute. Under these agreements, Ecuador is required to invest the loaned amounts in specific infrastructure projects or programs in Ecuador.
