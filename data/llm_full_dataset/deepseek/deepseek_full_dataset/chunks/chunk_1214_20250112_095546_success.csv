According to a November 2015 article from OECS Business Focus, the Chinese Government offered an RMB 90 million interest-free loan for this project, so that is the transaction amount (face value of the loan) that AidData has identified.2. It is not entirely clear if November 5, 2015 refers to the Phase 1 completion date, the Phase 2 completion date, or the completion date for both phases. This issue requires further investigation.3. According to a 2014 Debt Audit Report published by the Government of Antigua and Barbuda, the RMB 210 million GCL agreement with China Eximbank was signed on April 15, 2011. However,  the 2012 IMF Staff Report for Antigua and Barbuda reports that a preferential loan framework agreement for this project was signed on December 31, 2010, and the loan agreement was signed on September 13, 2011.4. Letters of exchange were signed by the Chinese Government and the Government of Antigua and Barbuda on August 31, 2011 (See: 中安巴政府签署中国援安巴新建机场航站楼项目等换文). However, it is unclear if this financial commitment refers to the interest-free loan or the grant. This issue merits further investigation.5. Another ETCA was signed on December 13, 2011, which reportedly committed an additional interest-free loan to construct the terminal building  (See: 中、安巴两国政府签署经济技术合作协定). However, the face value and borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. This issue merits further investigation.","# Sector
