65792,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides $121.55 million buyer’s credit loan for Taleghan Dam and Power Plant Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#67604),"In 2001, China Eximbank and the Regional Water Company of Tehran — an Iranian state-owned enterprise — signed a $121.55 million buyer’s credit loan agreement for the Taleghan Dam and Power Plant Construction Project. This loan carried an estimated maturity length of 14 years and an estimated grace period of 5 years. The loan repayment period began in the second half of 2006 and ended in 2014. The interest rate of the loan is unknown. This project was reportedly the first project to have received buyer’s credit insurance from China Export Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure).   The proceeds of the loan were used to finance 85% of the cost of a $143 million commercial contract with Sinohydro Group Ltd., which was signed on January 12, 2001. The purpose of the project was to construct a dam and an 18MW power plant in Qazvin Province, approximately 135 kilometers northwest of Tehran. More specifically, the project involved the construction of a 101 meter high clay core rockfill dam with a volume of 15.3 million cubic meters, a spillway with a maximum discharge of 2,500 cubic meters per second, and a hydropower station with an installed capacity of 18,000 kilowatts.
