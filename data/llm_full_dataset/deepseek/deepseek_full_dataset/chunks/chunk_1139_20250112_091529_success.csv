The project also involved the construction of a pump station, a booster pumping station, double-circuit overhead high-voltage cables, and 33 kilometers of large-caliber raw water and purified water distribution pipelines. Upon completion, the water treatment plant was expected to treat water from the country's mighty Padma River and deliver 450 million liters of water per day to millions of residents of the country’s capital (Dhaka). The project also sought to reduce the risk of geological hazards resulting from excessive exploitation of groundwater. China CAMC Engineering Co., Ltd. was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation.    Construction began in January 2013 and was originally expected to reach completion by June 2016.

The project involved the production and launching of a satellite as well as the construction of a ground control center (GCC) in the Minsk region (located 40 kilometers from the city of Minsk). Its ultimate goal was to improve radio and television broadcasting and improve internet service in Belarus and its neighboring regions.  It was agreed that the satellite would be jointly operated by Belarus and China during the first six months after its launch. However, Belarus would have exclusive control of the satellite thereafter.   China Great Wall Industry Corporation was the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation.
