The USD $40 million (or about XCD 117 million) project was fully financed with grant funding from the Chinese Government. These grant funds were drawn from a series of Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCAs) that the Government of Dominica and the Chinese Government signed. On December 14, 2012, the Government of Dominica and the Government of the People’s Republic of China signed an ETCA, which committed RMB 70 million (around $10 million) of grant funding for the Princess Margaret Hospital Expansion and Renovation Project (as captured via Project ID#61107 and ID#39822). On July 12, 2013, the Government of Dominica and the Government of the People’s Republic of China signed another ETCA, which committed an additional RMB 50 million of grant funding for the for the Princess Margaret Hospital Expansion and Renovation Project.

It signed a project implementation contract with the Ministry of Health of Dominica in December 2015. According to Chief Economic and Commercial Officer at the Chinese Embassy, Wang Quanhuo, due to the complexity of the project, it had to be divided into seven construction phases. The details of each phase are described below:  Phase I:  Construction on the first phase was originally expected to start in mid-2013 and end 2015. However, the groundbreaking ceremony took place at the Lindo Park in Goodwill on August 8, 2016. Construction was interrupted by the category five hurricane Maria that devastated Dominica in September 2017. But Maria's destructive force had some benefits. The hurricane prompted the authorities to make important improvements to the structure of the new hospital, making it more resistant to earthquakes and hurricanes. The first phase of the hospital was handed over on September 6, 2019 and the New National Hospital was renamed the Dominica China Friendship Hospital.   The first phase consisted of a two story Emergency Building that houses an Accident & Emergency Department and administrative offices. A second building was also constructed as part of this phase, a three-story Medical Technology Building which houses the Diagnostics and Radiology departments, Medical Laboratory Unit, and Dialysis Unit. Equipment highlighted by the Chinese Ambassador included an MRI scanner, X-ray machine, and HIFU. The total value of the medical equipment was reportedly more than EC$10 million. As of October 2021, DCFH is the only hospital in the OECS territory that owns and operates an MRI in its public health service. In order to further guarantee the security of all doctors, nurses and patients in case of future hurricanes, the Chinese Government also agreed to add cement roofs and anti-hurricane doors and windows for the Hospital.  Phase II:  The second phase consisted primarily of a new Eye Care Centre and was handed over in December 2020. The second and third phases were being constructed simultaneously. TheEye Care Centre consisted of an ophthalmology theatre on the ground floor and staff accommodation on the upper two floors.

In 2012, the Chinese government provided a $240 million loan for the development of a 911-style emergency service called ECU 911. The project was likely funded through a 2011 China Development Bank loan worth $2,052,360,403.03 (captured via Project ID#35950), specifically through the $1.4 billion discretionary component (Tranche A; Project ID#69319). The borrowing terms of Tranche A have been applied to this project.  In early December 2011, the first phase of the ECU 911 project was completed.

On 26 December 2012, the 911 Security Control Command Center opened in Quito, Ecuador.   Known as the ECU 911 Security Project (or Ecuador 911 Safety Emergency Response Command Center Project or National Public Safety Command and Control System Project), the surveillance system now has 16 regional response centers across the country, as well as a surveillance network with about 4,300 cameras, many of which were purchased from Huawei. Reports from Ecuador's Ministry of Finance show that ECU 911 spent approximately $700,000 in 2014 for equipment from Huawei. In 2015 and 2016, the Ecuadorian government spent a total of $900,000 for Huawei's LTE rapid response system. According to Ecuador's National Statistics and Census Institute (INEC), as of January 2018, the crime rate has dropped by 11.8 percent since implementing ECU 911.  In 2015, the Chinese Embassy in Ecuador agreed to donate a total of $15.4 million worth of goods to ECU 911 (Project ID#59325).  In 2016, China provided a $10 million non-repayable loan for the construction of a laboratory for ECU 911 at its headquarters in Quito (Project ID#59662).",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,Social Development,"Project focuses on public safety and emergency response systems, which are not directly related to energy transition or environmental impact","Development of 911-style emergency service, surveillance system, and regional response centers"
