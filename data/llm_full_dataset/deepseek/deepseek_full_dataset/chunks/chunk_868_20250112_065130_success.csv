73432,OTHER MULTISECTOR,"CDB provides $1 billion -- via oil-backed loan facility -- to finance 18 projects in Luanda Province (Linked to Project ID#66847, #95415)","On December 9, 2015, China Development Bank (CDB) entered into a $15 billion loan agreement (captured via Project ID#66847) with the Government of Angola. The loan is an oil prepayment facility with repayments being serviced through receivables from a designated oil contract. The pricing structure of the loan allows the Government of Angola to benefit from an upside in an increase in the price of oil. The loan has a maturity of 12 years and its availability period expired on December 9, 2017.    As a condition of the loan agreement, the lender required the borrower to maintain a minimum cash balance of approximately $1.5 billion in an escrow account known as the Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA). The proceeds of the loan facility were used to be used to recapitalize Sonangol, help Sonangol prepay some of its outstanding debts to CDB, and finance a series of public investment projects. As of December 31, 2017, the loan had achieved a 100% disbursement rate. Repayments commenced in 2018. The loan’s amount outstanding was $14.9 billion in December 2018, $14.5 billion as of June 30, 2019, and $11.3 billion as of December 31, 2021.   Chinese firms are reportedly responsible for carrying out most of the work tied to the subsidiary loans under the oil prepayment facility; however, the December 9, 2015 agreement specifies that at least 20% of the work would need to be subcontracted to Angolan firms and that local materials should be used whenever possible.  The following is a list of projects financed through the $15 oil prepayment facility agreement. The transaction (financial commitment) amounts for these projects are unknown and therefore not recorded: Project ID#66852: rehabilitation of a provincial hospital in Cabinda Project ID#66868: restoration and expansion of political administrative building in Cabinda Project ID#66869:  restoration and expansion of Cabinda University campus in Cabinda Project ID#73904: Soyo River and Land Terminal Construction Project Project ID#73546: Camucuio Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73547: Bibala Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73550: Cuemba Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73551: Tchicala-Tcholoanga Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73552: Bula Atumba Water Supply System Construction Project  Project ID#73554: Phase 2 of the Malanje Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73555: Marimba Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73556: Massango Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73560: M’Banza Water Supply System Construction Project  Project ID#73561: Quela Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73562: Muxima Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73563: Cangandala Water Supply System Construction Project  Project ID#73564: Jamba Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73565: Cacula Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73566: Kiwaba Nzoje Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73567: Lucapa Water Supply System Construction Project Project ID#73572: 15 km Cuito Road Rehabilitation Project Project ID#73630: Cabo Ledo-Lobito Section (Lot 2) and Ponte do Rio Longa-Ponte do Rio Keve Section of EN100 Road Rehabilitation Project Project ID#73631: Cabo Ledo-Lobito Section (Lot 5) and Ponte do Rio Eval-Ponte do Rio Culango Section of EN100 Road Rehabilitation Project Project ID#73914: Caconda-Chicomba-Quipungo Section (Lot 1) and Rio Ngalo-Caconda Section of EN110/EN280 Road Rehabilitation Project  The following projects were potentially funded through the $15 billion oil prepayment facility agreement: Project ID#68976: Supply of Equipment to Medical and Physical Rehabilitation Center in Huambo Project ID#68977: Supply of equipment to Municipal Hospital of Cunene Project ID#73905: 3000 Sambizanga Social Housing Units Project Project ID#73906: 12 km Sambizanga-Luanda Road Reconstruction Project Project ID#73460: Sumbe City Integrated Infrastructure Construction Project (Lots 1-3) Project ID#73684: 400 KM Laúca-Huambo Power Transmission Line Project Project ID#73559: Zango V Water Supply Project  Project ID#53063 records the $10 billion recapitalization of Sonangol and prepayment of outstanding debts to the CDB. [Note: In 2016, CDB approved a $10 billion subsidiary loan through this facility to enable the Government of Angola to recapitalize Sonangol (Angola’s state-owned oil company) and help Sonangol prepay some of its outstanding debts to CDB. Sonangol had previously borrowed $7.5 billion from CDB between 2010 and 2014, and through an on-lending arrangement with the Government of Angola, Sonangol used  $6.9 billion of the proceeds of the $10 billion loan to prepay several outstanding debts to CDB, including a $2.5 billion loan in 2010 for the Phase 1 of Kilamba Kiaxi Housing Construction Project (see Project ID#47101), a $2 billion loan in 2011 to support Sonangol’s development efforts (see Project ID#47102), and a $1 billion loan in 2012 to support Sonangol’s development efforts (see Project ID#47103). However, according to the IMF, a $6.9 billion loan on-lent to Sonangol (as part of the subsidiary loan) had a net value of $3.8 billion because part of the loan was used to refinance existing debt, implying that only $3.1 billion was used for re-financing.  $5 billion of the proceeds from the $15 billion oil prepayment facility agreement were reportedly to be used to finance public investment projects in Angola, including work on a dam in Kwanza Norte; several new roads and industrial hubs; the construction and rehabilitation of hospitals, medical centers, schools, universities, teaching training colleges; work on Cabinda's airport; domestic water and electricity connections; and irrigation projects. The credit line, often referred to as the China Credit Line (CCL), was reportedly meant to finance 155 public investment projects carried out by 37 Chinese companies.  The nine sectors that were to be covered by the CCL’s operational plan include 34 energy and water projects ($2.174 billion), 33 construction (including road repair) projects ($1.644 billion), and 55 education projects ($373 million). The province of Luanda, with 18 projects, was expected to receive about one-fifth of the total financing. The province of Huambo province was expected to receive $776 million for 12 projects.

The Government of Angola also agreed to use the outstanding cash balance in an escrow account — known as the Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) — to make interest payments to the CDB between 2020 to 2022, which it expected would bring the DSRA balance to nearly zero by mid-2022. However, under the terms of the debt reprofiling agreement, the parties agreed that the borrower would need to replenish the DSRA to approximately $1.5 billion (the minimum cash balance previously agreed upon by the lender and borrower) by 2023.","1.  The transaction (financial commitment) amount is recorded as $1 billion. It excludes the transaction amounts from projects in Luanda Province captured elsewhere by AidData, which sum to $468.2 million. 2. This transaction is not recorded as an umbrella record as it does not duplicate any other transactions captured by AidData, and should therefore be counted towards the total amount drawn down under the $15 billion oil-backed loan facility agreement.3. The interest rate and grace period that apply to the December 9, 2015 loan are unknown. For the time being, AidData relies on the weighted average interest rate (4.334%) and weighted average grace period (3.8333) that the World Bank's Debtor Reporting System (DRS) identifies as applying to China's official sector lending to Angola in 2015. See https://www.dropbox.com/s/949n5rctiue6d7c/IDS_Average_grace_period_and_maturity_on_new_external_debt_commitments.xlsx?dl=0 and https://www.dropbox.com/s/ab8qt4n6jijcbhd/IDS_Average%20interest%20on%20new%20external%20debt%20commitments.xlsx?dl=04. Oil prepayment contracts are also known as pre-export finance (PXF) facilities. A PXF facility is an arrangement in which a commodity (e.g. oil) producer gets up-front cash from a customer in return for a promise to repay the customer with that commodity (possibly at a discount) in the future. PXF funds may be advanced by a lender or syndicate of lenders to a commodity producer to assist the company in meeting either its working capital needs (for example, to cover the purchase of raw materials and costs associated with processing, storage and transport) or its capital investment needs (for example, investment in plant and machinery and other elements of infrastructure). PXF facilities are usually secured by (i) an assignment of rights by the producer under an ‘offtake contract’ (i.e., a sale and purchase contract between the producer and a buyer of that producer of goods or commodities), and (ii) a collection account charge over a bank account into which proceeds due to the producer from the buyer of the goods or commodities under the offtake contract are credited. There are two key documents in prepayment finance transactions: a contract providing for the advance payment by the offtaker to the producer for the purchase of goods/commodities (the 'Prepayment Contract'), and a loan agreement between a lender and the offtaker (the 'Offtaker Loan Agreement') under which the advance payment is financed.","# Sector

[Note: In 2016, CDB approved a $10 billion subsidiary loan through this facility to enable the Government of Angola to recapitalize Sonangol (Angola’s state-owned oil company) and help Sonangol prepay some of its outstanding debts to CDB. Sonangol had previously borrowed $7.5 billion from CDB between 2010 and 2014, and through an on-lending arrangement with the Government of Angola, Sonangol used  $6.9 billion of the proceeds of the $10 billion loan to prepay several outstanding debts to CDB, including a $2.5 billion loan in 2010 for the Phase 1 of Kilamba Kiaxi Housing Construction Project (see Project ID#47101), a $2 billion loan in 2011 to support Sonangol’s development efforts (see Project ID#47102), and a $1 billion loan in 2012 to support Sonangol’s development efforts (see Project ID#47103). However, according to the IMF, a $6.9 billion loan on-lent to Sonangol (as part of the subsidiary loan) had a net value of $3.8 billion because part of the loan was used to refinance existing debt, implying that only $3.1 billion was used for re-financing.  $5 billion of the proceeds from the $15 billion oil prepayment facility agreement were reportedly to be used to finance public investment projects in Angola, including work on a dam in Kwanza Norte; several new roads and industrial hubs; the construction and rehabilitation of hospitals, medical centers, schools, universities, teaching training colleges; work on Cabinda's airport; domestic water and electricity connections; and irrigation projects. The credit line, often referred to as the China Credit Line (CCL), was reportedly meant to finance 155 public investment projects carried out by 37 Chinese companies.  The nine sectors that were to be covered by the CCL’s operational plan include 34 energy and water projects ($2.174 billion), 33 construction (including road repair) projects ($1.644 billion), and 55 education projects ($373 million). The province of Luanda, with 18 projects, was expected to receive about one-fifth of the total financing. The province of Huambo province was expected to receive $776 million for 12 projects.

In December 2020, CDB and the Government of Angola entered into an agreement to reprofile multiple loan agreements that they had previously signed, including the $15 billion loan agreement from December 2015 (as captured via Project ID#95415). The December 2020 agreement included (i) a three-year deferral of principal payments; and (ii) repayment of deferred principal falling due in 2020H2–2023H1 over seven years after the grace period, with some additional modest relief of principal in 2024–25.   The Government of Angola also agreed to use the outstanding cash balance in an escrow account — known as the Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) — to make interest payments to the CDB between 2020 to 2022, which it expected would bring the DSRA balance to nearly zero by mid-2022. However, under the terms of the debt reprofiling agreement, the parties agreed that the borrower would need to replenish the DSRA to approximately $1.5 billion (the minimum cash balance previously agreed upon by the lender and borrower) by 2023.","1. The transaction (financial commitment) amount is recorded as $776 million. It excludes the transaction amounts for projects in Huambo Province captured elsewhere by AidData, which sum to $728.7 million. 2. This transaction is not recorded as an umbrella record as it does not duplicate any other transactions captured by AidData, and should therefore be counted towards the total amount drawn down under the $15 billion oil-backed loan facility agreement.3. The interest rate and grace period that apply to the December 9, 2015 loan are unknown. For the time being, AidData relies on the weighted average interest rate (4.334%) and weighted average grace period (3.8333) that the World Bank's Debtor Reporting System (DRS) identifies as applying to China's official sector lending to Angola in 2015. See https://www.dropbox.com/s/949n5rctiue6d7c/IDS_Average_grace_period_and_maturity_on_new_external_debt_commitments.xlsx?dl=0 and https://www.dropbox.com/s/ab8qt4n6jijcbhd/IDS_Average%20interest%20on%20new%20external%20debt%20commitments.xlsx?dl=04. Oil prepayment contracts are also known as pre-export finance (PXF) facilities. A PXF facility is an arrangement in which a commodity (e.g. oil) producer gets up-front cash from a customer in return for a promise to repay the customer with that commodity (possibly at a discount) in the future. PXF funds may be advanced by a lender or syndicate of lenders to a commodity producer to assist the company in meeting either its working capital needs (for example, to cover the purchase of raw materials and costs associated with processing, storage and transport) or its capital investment needs (for example, investment in plant and machinery and other elements of infrastructure). PXF facilities are usually secured by (i) an assignment of rights by the producer under an ‘offtake contract’ (i.e., a sale and purchase contract between the producer and a buyer of that producer of goods or commodities), and (ii) a collection account charge over a bank account into which proceeds due to the producer from the buyer of the goods or commodities under the offtake contract are credited. There are two key documents in prepayment finance transactions: a contract providing for the advance payment by the offtaker to the producer for the purchase of goods/commodities (the 'Prepayment Contract'), and a loan agreement between a lender and the offtaker (the 'Offtaker Loan Agreement') under which the advance payment is financed.","# Sector

CDB provides $776 million -- via oil-backed loan facility -- to finance 12 projects in Huambo Province (Linked to Project ID#66847, #95415)

# Description
On December 9, 2015, China Development Bank (CDB) entered into a $15 billion loan agreement (captured via Project ID#66847) with the Government of Angola. The loan is an oil prepayment facility with repayments being serviced through receivables from a designated oil contract. The pricing structure of the loan allows the Government of Angola to benefit from an upside in an increase in the price of oil. The loan has a maturity of 12 years and its availability period expired on December 9, 2017.    As a condition of the loan agreement, the lender required the borrower to maintain a minimum cash balance of approximately $1.5 billion in an escrow account known as the Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA). The proceeds of the loan facility were used to be used to recapitalize Sonangol, help Sonangol prepay some of its outstanding debts to CDB, and finance a series of public investment projects. As of December 31, 2017, the loan had achieved a 100% disbursement rate. Repayments commenced in 2018. The loan’s amount outstanding was $14.9 billion in December 2018, $14.5 billion as of June 30, 2019, and $11.3 billion as of December 31, 2021.   Chinese firms are reportedly responsible for carrying out most of the work tied to the subsidiary loans under the oil prepayment facility; however, the December 9, 2015 agreement specifies that at least 20% of the work would need to be subcontracted to Angolan firms and that local materials should be used whenever possible.

89414,BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES,BCRA makes RMB 70 billion drawdown under currency swap agreement with PBOC in 2015,"On April 2009, the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (Banco Central de la República Argentina, or BCRA) and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) signed an RMB 70 billion ($11 billion) bilateral currency swap agreement to facilitate trade and improve foreign currency liquidity in Argentina. The agreement was extended for an additional three years in July 2014.   BCRA made (gross) drawdowns under the currency swap agreement equivalent to approximately RMB 14.2 billon between October 2014 and December 2014 — through an RMB 5.2 billion ($814 million) drawdown on October 30, 2014, and RMB 3 billion ($507 million) drawdown on November 17, 2014, and an RMB 6 billion ($1.14 billion) drawdown in December 2014. These borrowings carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 4% margin (400 basis points) and a 1-year maturity length.   BCRA also made (gross) drawdowns under the currency swap agreement equivalent to approximately RMB 70 billion — including but not limited to an RMB 2.5 billion ($400 million) drawdown in early January 2015, an RMB 2.5 billion ($400 million) drawdown in late January 2015, and a $1.5 billion drawdown in March 2015. These borrowings also carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 4% margin (400 basis points) and a 1-year maturity length.   Then, on December 16, 2015, BCRA and PBOC signed a supplementary agreement, authorizing (a) the conversion of the RMB that BCRA receives from PBOC in exchange for Argentine pesos (ARS) into any currency (including U.S. dollars) and (b) the use of such funds to service foreign debt obligations. These concessions from PBOC were valuable to BCRA because the Government of Argentina was having difficulty borrowing dollars on international markets after defaulting on its debt in July 2014.   During calendar year 2016, BCRA made (gross) drawdowns under its currency swap agreement with the PBOC equivalent to approximately RMB 70 billion.   Then, on July 18, 2017, BCRA and PBOC extended their RMB 70 billion (ARS 175 billion) bilateral currency swap agreement by an additional three years. During calendar year 2017, BCRA made (gross) drawdowns under its currency swap agreement with the PBOC equivalent to approximately RMB 70 billion.   Then, in 2018, BCRA and PBOC amended the July 18, 2017 agreement to increase the size of the currency swap from RMB 70 billion to RMB 130 billion (approximately $19 billion) — roughly equivalent to one-third of the BCRA’s foreign reserve assets. The 2018 agreement also specified that the PBOC could reject currency swap drawdowns by the BCRA if the Government of Argentina’s IMF standby agreement was suspended or cancelled.   During calendar year 2018, BCRA made (gross) drawdowns under its expanded currency swap agreement with the PBOC equivalent to approximately RMB 130 billion — including but not limited to an RMB 60 billion ($8.7 billion) drawdown on December 17, 2018. These borrowings carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 4% margin (400 basis points) and a 1-year maturity length.   During calendar year 2019, BCRA made (gross) drawdowns under its expanded currency swap agreement with the PBOC equivalent to approximately RMB 130 billion. These borrowings carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 4% margin (400 basis points) and a 1-year maturity length.   The 70 billion currency swap agreement was extended for an additional 3 years on July 17, 2020 and the RMB 60 billion currency swap agreement was extended for an additional 3 years on September 17, 2020.   During calendar year 2020, BCRA made (gross) drawdowns under its expanded currency swap agreement with the PBOC equivalent to approximately RMB 130 billion. These borrowings carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 4% margin (400 basis points) and a 3-month maturity length. BCRA also made (gross) drawdowns under its expanded currency swap agreement with the PBOC equivalent to approximately RMB 130 billion during calendar year 2021.    These borrowings carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 4% margin (400 basis points) and a 3-month maturity length. As of December 2021, total PBOC swap debt (RMB 130 billion or $20.4 billion) represented 51% of the BCRA’s foreign currency reserves.   The BCRA’s 2014 drawdowns are captured via Project ID#89411. Its 2015 drawdowns are captured via Project ID#89414. Its 2016 drawdowns are captured via Project ID#95682. Its 2017 drawdowns are captured via Project ID#95912. Its 2018 drawdowns are captured via Project ID#89416. Its 2019 drawdowns are captured via Project ID#96263. Its 2020 drawdowns are captured via Project ID#96264. Its 2021 drawdowns are captured via Project ID#96322.  According to the BCRA, the total (principal) amount outstanding under the PBOC currency swap facility was RMB 14.2 billion ($2,320,635,000) in 2014, RMB 70 billion ($10,783,360,000) in 2015, RMB 70 billion ($10,072,230,000) in 2016, RMB 70 billion ($10,750,040,000) in 2017, RMB 130 billion ($18,969,730,000) in 2018, RMB 130 billion ($18,605,990,000) in 2019, RMB 130 billion ($19,893,250,000) in 2020, and RMB 130 billion ($20,406,880,000) in 2021.","1. A bilateral currency swap (BCS) agreement — also known as a central bank liquidity swap agreement — is an agreement between the central banks of two countries to exchange cash flows in different currencies at predetermined rates over a specified period of time. Central banks participate in these agreements to facilitate bilateral trade settlements using their national currencies (rather than relying upon a third-party currency such as the U.S. dollar), manage demands from their local banks, and provide liquidity support to financial markets. The party that draws down on the swap line becomes the borrower and the other party becomes lender. During the term of the swap, the party that draws down on the swap line makes either fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amount. If both parties draw down on the swap line, then both parties exchange fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amounts. The 5-step process of drawing upon a currency swap line with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) can described from the perspective of an importer in a given country (‘Country X’) seeking to settle trade with a Chinese firm in RMB. Step 1: The central bank of Country X and the PBOC activate their currency swap in advance, at which point each party deposits a specific amount of its currency in an account controlled by the other party (i.e. the central bank of Country X deposits local currency in an account controlled by the PBOC, and the PBOC deposits an equivalent amount in RMB in an account controlled by the central bank of Country X). Step 2: A firm in Country X that imports goods from China applies for an RMB-denominated loan from a domestic bank. Step 3: The domestic bank in Country X that receives the loan application then applies to its central bank for an RMB-denominated loan. After a review process, the central bank of Country X notifies the domestic bank applicant that its loan application was approved. The central bank of Country X subsequently requests that the PBOC transfer RMB funds from the central bank of Country X’s swap account within the PBOC to the loan applicant’s account with a corresponding bank in China. Step 4: The domestic bank in Country X directs the corresponding bank in China to transfer RMB funds into a Chinese exporter’s account, and the corresponding bank in China provides RMB funds to the Chinese exporter. Step 5: The importer in Country X repays the RMB-denominated loan at its maturity date. The domestic bank notifies the central bank of Country X of the repayment, and transfers RMB into the central bank’s account within the PBOC through the corresponding bank in China. For the central bank of Country X, the RMB deposit is an asset that should be recorded on its balance sheet as an official reserve asset denominated in RMB. The contra entry of this asset is the liability in the local currency of Country X that represents China’s claims in the central bank of Country X. This should be also recorded on the balance sheet of the central bank of Country X. At the time of the exchange of currencies, it should be recorded as an increase in assets and an increase in liabilities of the monetary authorities in the balance of payments. The reason why the PBOC uses this mechanism to provide renminbi liquidity to other central bank is to increase the speed, convenience, and volume of transactions between the two countries. More detailed information about currency swaps with the PBOC can be found at https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021210-print-pdf.ashx and https://thechinaguys.com/the-rise-of-the-renminbi-the-reality-of-bilateral-swap-agreements/ and https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2017/pdf/17-25a.pdf.2. AidData treats drawdowns under BCS agreements with the PBOC as collateralized loans because, in a BCS arrangement, the currency of the borrower is held as collateral while the lender receives interest on the amount drawn down by the borrower until repayment is made.3. AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate by adding 4% to the average 6-month SHIBOR rate (3.76%) in 2015.4. Multiple sources indicate that BCRA fully utilized the RMB 70 billion ($11 billion) bilateral currency swap with the PBOC in 2014 and 2015 According to a IMF Country Report No. 16/346, “[a]s of end-August [2016], gross reserves were US$31.2 billion amounting to 5.4 months of import cover or 71 percent of the IMF’s reserve adequacy metric. A large part of the reserves (US$11 billion) is from a renminbi swap line with China.” El Cronista, a local media outlet in Argentina, reports (see https://www.cronista.com/finanzas-mercados/Renueva-hoy-el-Banco-Central-el-primer-tramo-del-swap-con-China-20151030-0037.html) that the RMB 70 billion was fully exhausted by BCRA by September 2015, which implies that RMB 55.8 billion was drawn down in calendar year 2015 (since RMB 14.2 billion was drawn down in 2014).5. According to the IMF Country Report No. 16/69, “the government negotiated and activated a renminbi swap line with the People’s Bank of China, drawing a total of US$4.6 billion as of late April 2015.” The same report says that the Government borrowed $2.4 billion from the PBOC in 2014, which implies that $2.2 billion was borrowed between January 2015 and April 2015.6. According to IMF Country Report No. 18/374, “[o]n December 17, [2018] gross reserves increased by US$8.7bn, reflecting the activation of the augmented BCRA swap with the People’s Bank of China. The augmentation, which was signed during the recent G20, brings the total amount of freely available resources under the swap to US$18.7 billion. Gross international reserves moved up to US$58.6 billion.”7. For evidence that the BCRA can convert the RMB it receives from PBOC into U.S. dollars (USD), see pg. 9 of the BCRA's 2015 financial statements. See https://www.dropbox.com/s/13bbay8z0psekx3/i2015financialstatements.pdf?dl=08. The December 16, 2015 supplementary agreement can be accessed in its entirety via https://www.dropbox.com/s/lm13xl9qwxcdl5c/Supplementary%20Agreement%20regarding%20the%20Bilateral%20Currency%20Swap%20Agreement%20Between%20PBOC%20and%20BCRA.pdf?dl=0.9. Most central banks publish their end-of-year outstanding PBOC swap debt, but only a few report detailed transaction-level data on drawdowns during the year. Therefore, if no information on drawings is available, AidData assumes that total drawdowns during the reporting period equal the amount outstanding at the end of the reporting period (and vice versa). Since the (de jure) maturities of PBOC swap drawings are 12 months or less, this creates a lower bound estimate for actual drawdowns under the PBOC swap line. 10. PBOC swap debt is frequently rolled over. In central bank reports where one can only observe the year-end outstanding amount, no distinction between rollovers and drawdowns is possible. In these cases, one can derive (new) drawdowns as the difference between the current and last year’s outstanding swap debt stock. This measure essentially captures net lending through the PBOC swap line.","# Sector

BCRA makes RMB 70 billion drawdown under currency swap agreement with PBOC in 2015

# Description
On April 2009, the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (Banco Central de la República Argentina, or BCRA) and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) signed an RMB 70 billion ($11 billion) bilateral currency swap agreement to facilitate trade and improve foreign currency liquidity in Argentina. The agreement was extended for an additional three years in July 2014.   BCRA made (gross) drawdowns under the currency swap agreement equivalent to approximately RMB 14.2 billon between October 2014 and December 2014 — through an RMB 5.2 billion ($814 million) drawdown on October 30, 2014, and RMB 3 billion ($507 million) drawdown on November 17, 2014, and an RMB 6 billion ($1.14 billion) drawdown in December 2014. These borrowings carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 4% margin (400 basis points) and a 1-year maturity length.   BCRA also made (gross) drawdowns under the currency swap agreement equivalent to approximately RMB 70 billion — including but not limited to an RMB 2.5 billion ($400 million) drawdown in early January 2015, an RMB 2.5 billion ($400 million) drawdown in late January 2015, and a $1.5 billion drawdown in March 2015.

The 2018 agreement also specified that the PBOC could reject currency swap drawdowns by the BCRA if the Government of Argentina’s IMF standby agreement was suspended or cancelled.   During calendar year 2018, BCRA made (gross) drawdowns under its expanded currency swap agreement with the PBOC equivalent to approximately RMB 130 billion — including but not limited to an RMB 60 billion ($8.7 billion) drawdown on December 17, 2018. These borrowings carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 4% margin (400 basis points) and a 1-year maturity length.

These borrowings carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 4% margin (400 basis points) and a 1-year maturity length.   The 70 billion currency swap agreement was extended for an additional 3 years on July 17, 2020 and the RMB 60 billion currency swap agreement was extended for an additional 3 years on September 17, 2020.   During calendar year 2020, BCRA made (gross) drawdowns under its expanded currency swap agreement with the PBOC equivalent to approximately RMB 130 billion. These borrowings carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 4% margin (400 basis points) and a 3-month maturity length. BCRA also made (gross) drawdowns under its expanded currency swap agreement with the PBOC equivalent to approximately RMB 130 billion during calendar year 2021.    These borrowings carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 4% margin (400 basis points) and a 3-month maturity length. As of December 2021, total PBOC swap debt (RMB 130 billion or $20.4 billion) represented 51% of the BCRA’s foreign currency reserves.   The BCRA’s 2014 drawdowns are captured via Project ID#89411.

54685,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",ICBC contributes to $520 million syndicated loan to expand Cerro Dragon block and Lindero Atravesado block (linked to Project ID#92307 and Project ID#92496),"On July 30, 2015, the Argentine branch of Pan American Energy (PAE) signed a $520 million syndicated loan contract to finance part of the company’s investment program in exploration and production of oil and gas in Argentina. The loan was organized by the International Finance Corporation (IFC ID number 36146) and has two tranches. Tranche A is $120 million from the IFC with a 6.83 year maturity (final maturity June 2022). Tranche B is $400 million with a 4.83 year maturity (final maturity June 2020). Both tranches had a variable interest rate based on the six-month LIBOR, plus an unknown margin. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) contributed an estimated $57,142,857.14 to Tranche B. Other contributors to Tranche B included Itaú BBA, Natixis, Santander, Banco Latinoamericano de Comercio Exterior (Bladex), BBVA, and Credit Agricole. The loan is guaranteed by Pan American.  As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding balance on the loan was $104.5 million.  PAE, which is Argentina’s second largest hydrocarbons producer, was to use the loan proceeds to support its $1.5 billion expansion program in the Cerro Dragon block in the San Jorge Gulf off southern Patagonia (which had been the center of a violent labor dispute in 2012) and the Lindero Atravesado block in Neuquen. The engagement encompassed activities related to drilling, secondary recovery, facility expansions, improvements, and parts of the 2015/2016 investment program to support increased oil and gas production.  Prior to this, ICBC also contributed to a syndicate organized by the Development Bank of Latin America (Corporacion Andina de Fomento, CAF) in 2014. That loan's purpose was also to partially finance the expansion program in the Cerro Dragón block, and it is captured via Project ID#92496.  Then, in September 2020, the Office of the Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman (CAO) received a complaint regarding the both the IFC loan to this project (IFC ID number 36146) and their participation in a syndicated loan to PAE in 2019 (IFC ID number 42169), which also included ICBC participation and is captured in Project ID#92307.  The complaint was from a former worker of one of PAE´s former contractors in Cerro Dragón, on behalf of himself and approximately ten other former workers of the same and other contractors. The Complainants allege that PAE has deprived them of their right to work by unfairly accusing them in court of actively participating in a violent seizure of the Cerro Dragón oil filed in 2012. As a result, they believe they are entitled to economic compensation and allege that the Company has failed to honor an out-of-court settlement agreement stating that the Complainants are entitled to compensation. The Complainants did not request confidentiality.   The Complainants stated they were unfairly cited (and in some cases, indicted) in criminal court proceedings initiated by PAE for a violent seizure of the Cerro Dragón oil field in 2012, operated by PAE. The Complainants claimed that they were not involved in the violent incidents that took place in 2012, but that PAE’s contractors nevertheless laid them off at the request of PAE. The Complainants additionally claimed that because of the criminal court proceedings and the violent incidents from 2012, PAE labelled them as ‘terrorists’ and thereafter, no other company in the oil and gas sector in Argentina would hire them. They alleged that, as a result, PAE has deprived them of their right to work for the past eight years, and they believe they are entitled to economic compensation for the years during which they have not been able to access jobs.   The Complainants also alleged that they signed out-of-court settlement agreements with PAE in 2019 (amended in 2020), whereby PAE agreed to pay each Complainant the sum of ARS $12 million (USD $120,000 approx.) in compensation for affecting their right to work as a consequence of the criminal court proceedings they were involved with, related to the 2012 seizure of the Cerro Dragón oil field. The Complainants informed CAO that they were approached and allegedly represented by a lawyer called María Duffey Laxague in the process of the signing the out-of-court settlements, but believe she later turned on them and partnered with PAE in bad faith to deceive them. The Complainants stated that that payments stipulated in the agreement were not met by PAE. The Complainants have also expressed distrust regarding PAE’s allegations that no such dealings with the lawyer exist and that legal action for fraud has been filed against her by the Company. The Complainants informed CAO that they had sent PAE a letter (cartadocumento) as a formal notification of their intention to pursue legal action if PAE does not pay the economic compensation that they believe they are entitled to. Nonetheless, they have expressed their willingness to address the issue of the complaint through dialogue under the auspices of the Dispute Resolution function of the CAO.   PAE stated that the violent incidents in the Cerro Dragón oil field in 2012 were an unprecedented attack on private property. Following the violent incidents, several individuals, including the individual who filed the complaint, were prosecuted by the State in criminal courts (not by PAE). PAE also shared that it is not their policy or practice to label or retaliate against former workers of its contractors, or anyone. They stated that the violent seizure of the oil field Cerro Dragón in 2012 is public knowledge for everyone in the industry and there is an ongoing criminal judicial proceeding before the Federal Courts in Comodoro Rivadavia, in the Province of Chubut in relation to the seizure. They also stated that PAE did not have any influence on the Complainants’ alleged inability to access jobs.   PAE additionally rejected the Complainants’ claim that economic compensation was due to them. PAE stated that they had not entered into an out-of-court settlement agreement with any of the Complainants. The Company claimed that the alleged out-of-court settlement agreements were fraudulent and were forged by the Complainants’ lawyer María Duffey Laxague. As a result, PAE has taken legal action against the lawyer for the crimes of fraud and falsification of public 8 documents, currently before Criminal Court nbr. 54 (Juzgado Nacional en lo Criminal y Correccional Nro. 54), under court proceeding nbr. 24.082/2020 (“Imputada: Duffey Laxagüe, María Auxliadora s/ Estafa procesal, defraudación por contrato simulado, falsificación de documentos públicos, y uso de documento falso o adulterado (art. 296 Código Penal)”.

On July 30, 2015, the Argentine branch of Pan American Energy (PAE) signed a $520 million syndicated loan contract to finance part of the company’s investment program in exploration and production of oil and gas in Argentina. The loan was organized by the International Finance Corporation (IFC ID number 36146) and has two tranches. Tranche A is $120 million from the IFC with a 6.83 year maturity (final maturity June 2022). Tranche B is $400 million with a 4.83 year maturity (final maturity June 2020). Both tranches had a variable interest rate based on the six-month LIBOR, plus an unknown margin. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) contributed an estimated $57,142,857.14 to Tranche B. Other contributors to Tranche B included Itaú BBA, Natixis, Santander, Banco Latinoamericano de Comercio Exterior (Bladex), BBVA, and Credit Agricole. The loan is guaranteed by Pan American.  As of December 31, 2019, the outstanding balance on the loan was $104.5 million.  PAE, which is Argentina’s second largest hydrocarbons producer, was to use the loan proceeds to support its $1.5 billion expansion program in the Cerro Dragon block in the San Jorge Gulf off southern Patagonia (which had been the center of a violent labor dispute in 2012) and the Lindero Atravesado block in Neuquen. The engagement encompassed activities related to drilling, secondary recovery, facility expansions, improvements, and parts of the 2015/2016 investment program to support increased oil and gas production.  Prior to this, ICBC also contributed to a syndicate organized by the Development Bank of Latin America (Corporacion Andina de Fomento, CAF) in 2014. That loan's purpose was also to partially finance the expansion program in the Cerro Dragón block, and it is captured via Project ID#92496.  Then, in September 2020, the Office of the Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman (CAO) received a complaint regarding the both the IFC loan to this project (IFC ID number 36146) and their participation in a syndicated loan to PAE in 2019 (IFC ID number 42169), which also included ICBC participation and is captured in Project ID#92307.  The complaint was from a former worker of one of PAE´s former contractors in Cerro Dragón, on behalf of himself and approximately ten other former workers of the same and other contractors. The Complainants allege that PAE has deprived them of their right to work by unfairly accusing them in court of actively participating in a violent seizure of the Cerro Dragón oil filed in 2012. As a result, they believe they are entitled to economic compensation and allege that the Company has failed to honor an out-of-court settlement agreement stating that the Complainants are entitled to compensation. The Complainants did not request confidentiality.   The Complainants stated they were unfairly cited (and in some cases, indicted) in criminal court proceedings initiated by PAE for a violent seizure of the Cerro Dragón oil field in 2012, operated by PAE. The Complainants claimed that they were not involved in the violent incidents that took place in 2012, but that PAE’s contractors nevertheless laid them off at the request of PAE. The Complainants additionally claimed that because of the criminal court proceedings and the violent incidents from 2012, PAE labelled them as ‘terrorists’ and thereafter, no other company in the oil and gas sector in Argentina would hire them. They alleged that, as a result, PAE has deprived them of their right to work for the past eight years, and they believe they are entitled to economic compensation for the years during which they have not been able to access jobs.   The Complainants also alleged that they signed out-of-court settlement agreements with PAE in 2019 (amended in 2020), whereby PAE agreed to pay each Complainant the sum of ARS $12 million (USD $120,000 approx.) in compensation for affecting their right to work as a consequence of the criminal court proceedings they were involved with, related to the 2012 seizure of the Cerro Dragón oil field. The Complainants informed CAO that they were approached and allegedly represented by a lawyer called María Duffey Laxague in the process of the signing the out-of-court settlements, but believe she later turned on them and partnered with PAE in bad faith to deceive them. The Complainants stated that that payments stipulated in the agreement were not met by PAE. The Complainants have also expressed distrust regarding PAE’s allegations that no such dealings with the lawyer exist and that legal action for fraud has been filed against her by the Company. The Complainants informed CAO that they had sent PAE a letter (cartadocumento) as a formal notification of their intention to pursue legal action if PAE does not pay the economic compensation that they believe they are entitled to. Nonetheless, they have expressed their willingness to address the issue of the complaint through dialogue under the auspices of the Dispute Resolution function of the CAO.   PAE stated that the violent incidents in the Cerro Dragón oil field in 2012 were an unprecedented attack on private property. Following the violent incidents, several individuals, including the individual who filed the complaint, were prosecuted by the State in criminal courts (not by PAE). PAE also shared that it is not their policy or practice to label or retaliate against former workers of its contractors, or anyone. They stated that the violent seizure of the oil field Cerro Dragón in 2012 is public knowledge for everyone in the industry and there is an ongoing criminal judicial proceeding before the Federal Courts in Comodoro Rivadavia, in the Province of Chubut in relation to the seizure. They also stated that PAE did not have any influence on the Complainants’ alleged inability to access jobs.   PAE additionally rejected the Complainants’ claim that economic compensation was due to them. PAE stated that they had not entered into an out-of-court settlement agreement with any of the Complainants. The Company claimed that the alleged out-of-court settlement agreements were fraudulent and were forged by the Complainants’ lawyer María Duffey Laxague. As a result, PAE has taken legal action against the lawyer for the crimes of fraud and falsification of public 8 documents, currently before Criminal Court nbr. 54 (Juzgado Nacional en lo Criminal y Correccional Nro. 54), under court proceeding nbr. 24.082/2020 (“Imputada: Duffey Laxagüe, María Auxliadora s/ Estafa procesal, defraudación por contrato simulado, falsificación de documentos públicos, y uso de documento falso o adulterado (art. 296 Código Penal)”. The court's jurisdiction has been confirmed in the City of Buenos Aires, and PAE has appeared before the court as the plaintiff (parte querellante).",TRUE,NA,BROWN,HIGH,Oil and Gas Infrastructure,Primary purpose is expansion of oil and gas production facilities,"Loan used for drilling, secondary recovery, and facility expansions to increase oil and gas production in Cerro Dragon and Lindero Atravesado blocks"
