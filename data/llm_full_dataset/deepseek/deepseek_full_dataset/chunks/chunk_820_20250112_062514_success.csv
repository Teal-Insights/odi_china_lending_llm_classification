Under most EPC+F contractual arrangements, the EPC contractor is responsible for securing a loan to finance the EPC contract but the host government is responsible for providing a sovereign guarantee on debt repayment and an equity infusion. Under the terms of the January 2016 EPC+F contract, the Government of Myanmar was responsible for financing 35% of the project cost (through an equity infusion) and CET was responsible for securing financing for the remaining 65%. China Eximbank issued an export seller’s credit to CET to finance its portion of the EPC+F contract (worth $86,755,000, or 65% of $133.47 million). CET also secured credit insurance from Sinosure.
