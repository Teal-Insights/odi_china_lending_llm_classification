Almost a decade later, in 2016, CRBC and the Government of Cambodia signed an investment framework agreement for the project. Then, on January 11, 2018, CRBC and the Government of Cambodia signed a concession agreement for the Phnom Penh–Sihanoukville Expressway Construction Project. Under the terms of the concession agreement,  CRBC agreed to implement the Phnom Penh–Sihanoukville Expressway Project on a ‘build-operate-transfer’ (BOT) basis and finance the project with a mix of debt, equity and grant financing. The concession agreement specifies a 4-year construction period and a 50-year expressway operation/toll collection period.  On January 22, 2019, China’s Ministry of Commerce provided an RMB 600 million ($88,540,000) grant in support of the project (captured via Project ID#61788).  Then, on April 22, 2019, China Development Bank (CDB) and China Eximbank (captured via Project ID#61784) and Cambodian PPSHV Expressway Co Ltd.

CDB is lead arranger of the syndicate (captured via Project ID#92472), and Sinosure agreed to provide credit insurance.  CRBC also agreed to make a $600 million equity contribution (captured via Project ID#66726).   The purpose of this project is to construct a 190.6 km (new) expressway that will link Cambodia’s capital, Phnom Penh, to Sihanoukville, site of the nation’s only deep-sea port. More than 90% of Cambodia’s total container traffic passes through Sihanoukville. The Phnom Penh–Sihanoukville Expressway is to be named as Road E4. It will run from Village I, Samrong Krom, Porsenchey, Phnom Penh to Village I, Sangkat III, Sihanoukville.  The route will pass through about 8.3 km of Phnom Penh, 9.1 km of Kandal province, 80.8 km of Kampong Speu province, 1.92 km of Koh Kong province, and 89.89 km of Sihanoukville. Built in asphalt concrete with 4 lanes, each in 3.75 meters, the total width of the expressway will be 24.5 meters including the garden in between the opposite lanes. All kinds of vehicles will be able use this expressway at a speed of 100 km to 120 km per hour. The expressway will include 263 pipes, 85 bridges, 6 traffic intersections (linked to National Road 4), another 28 intersections, 20 flyovers, and 237 underground places. Drivers will be able to refill and do stop-overs in between their trips for there will be 4 commercial areas with rest stops, 3 gas stations, and a large parking lot. Other road facilities that will be included are road barriers to ensure the safety of drivers and animals, 4 road maintenance departments, 8 toll gates, and multiple traffic lights and signages. CRBC is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation.   The project officially commenced on March 22, 2019.  As of June 2021, the project had achieved a 55% completion rate. As of April 28, 2022, the project had achieved a 90% completion rate. Its originally expected completion date was September 2022. However, the expressway was ultimately opened to the public on October 1, 2022 for a month's trial use for free to attract motorists. Since the beginning of the construction period, the project has reportedly created 6,000 jobs. It is expected to create 10,000 jobs after completion. Since the beginning of construction, this project has already provided around 6,000 direct employments, plus around 10,000 jobs after completion. Once the expressway is in operation, commuters and drivers will be able travel between Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville in 90 minutes, as compared to 5 hours without the expressway. All vehicles will be initially be able use the route free of charge for 1 month. After that, toll gates will actively collect fees (at a 20% discount during the first year). The exact fee for the expressway has yet to be confirmed but is expected to be the lowest among other ASEAN expressway fees.
