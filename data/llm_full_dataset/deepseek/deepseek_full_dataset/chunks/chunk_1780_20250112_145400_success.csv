Project ID#73357 captures the loan that was issued to CTEXIC.  The company was formally registered and established in Cotonou in February 2000. This project supported the construction, operation and management of a textile factory in the city of Lokassa called Compagnie Béninoise de Textile (CBT). The main factory building was designed with 24,000 cotton spindles and 768 weaving looms. It was built to achieve a production capacity of 13.7 million meters of unbleached cotton fabric and 923 tons of pure cotton yarn. The factory was put into production on October 31, 2002.  CBT subsequently encountered financial problems and China Eximbank had to reschedule its loans with La Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement du Bénin and CTEXIC. China Eximbank reportedly rescheduled its loan to La Caisse Autonome d'Amortissement du Bénin in 2004 and its loan to CTEXIC on August 23, 2011 The terms of the 2004 rescheduling are unknown; however, it is known that the 2011 rescheduling resulted in a reduction of the loan’s interest rate to 1%. The 2004 loan restructuring is captured via Project ID#73365, and the 2011 restructuring is captured via Project ID#73366.  As of 2018, SITEX had gone bankrupt and was looking to restructure, but the CBT factory was in production with 1200 employees (5 of whom were Chinese and 1,995 of whom were Beninese).",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,General Infrastructure,Textile factory construction and operation does not have clear environmental or energy transition impacts,"Construction and operation of textile factory with cotton spindles and weaving looms, no mention of energy or environmental aspects"
