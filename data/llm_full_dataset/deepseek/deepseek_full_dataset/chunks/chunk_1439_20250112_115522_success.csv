China Eximbank provides $32.317 million buyer’s credit loan for Dundo and Saurimo Water System Rehabilitation and Reinforcement Project (Linked to Project ID#42029)

# Description
On November 28, 2003, the Chinese Government and the Angolan Government signed a framework agreement pertaining to a special economic cooperation arrangement (Agreement name in Chinese: 中华人民共和国商务部与安哥拉共和国财政部关于两国经贸合作特殊安排的框架协议).  Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility,  carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).

54572,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides RMB 304 million government concessional loan for the 30MW Wadadli Power Plant Construction Project (linked to Project ID#54574),"During the second half of 2006, the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, and others on behalf of the Government of Antigua and Barbuda and Antigua Public Utilities Authority (APUA), reportedly began discussions with Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co. Ltd (BCEG) about the possibility installing power generators in Antigua. These negotiations resulted in a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between APUA and BCEG signed on November 11, 2006. Then, on May 21, 2008, the Chinese Government and the Government of Antigua and Barbuda signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the 30MW Wadadli Power Plant Construction Project. Then, on June 26, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Antigua and Barbuda signed an RMB 300,000,000 (EC$ 117,690,000) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL No. (2008) 15 TOTAL NO. (234)] for the 30MW Wadadli Power Plant Construction Project. The GCL carries the following terms: a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 20.75 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 0.6% management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee. The GCL’s final maturity date is March 21, 2029. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract between APUA and BCEG, which was signed on March 11, 2008. The loan's (principal) amount outstanding was EC$ 71,172,774 (or approximately RMB 167,759,220) as of September 2020.  The purpose of the project was to construct the 30MW Wadadli power plant — with six 5MW generators — in Crabbs, Antigua. Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co. Ltd. was the contractor responsible for project implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on October 2, 2008. The project was officially completed and handed over to the local authorities on September 8, 2011. Then, in 2012, the plant stopped working due to consistent overheating. Allegations arose that the power plant engines were used, rather than the new engines that Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co. Ltd. had promised. Another allegation emerged: that the engines only cost RMB 147 million and that the additional RMB 157 million was never allocated or misappropriated. The power plant already had rusting before the point of its commissioning in 2011 and it was decommissioned five years later (in 2016). Three of the units were brought back into use in 2017 at the cost of $6 million. However, one of the units failed again several years later.   In September 2020, APUA’s Electricity Business Unit Manager, Andre Matthias, announced that the power plant would be closing due to the conditions of the plant itself and its underperformance. In September 2020, the outstanding balance of the China Eximbank loan was EC$71,172,774 (or approximately RMB 167,759,220), which prompted questions and concerns about how the loan would be repaid in the absence of electricity sales from a functioning power plant. Antigua and Barbuda’s Information Minister Melford Nicholas said in September 2020 that ‘It is a tricky issue because as you would know the government enjoys a very good bilateral relationship with the People’s Republic of China and this represents a blot, represents a terrible outcome in terms of what should have been an effective developmental support for the infrastructure in the country. It really is a bad situation. […] I think the most that can happen now is for both parties to have a conversation as to what happens to the outstanding arrears and the debt that has been incurred and whether or not consideration will be given for it to be written off […] and whether or not there is a methodology of converting the debt into another form of development but it is not something that is an easy road to tread. […] We do not want to necessarily impair that relationship with the government of China and allow this particular issue to impair the relationship but clearly we have not gotten value for money […] and so something needs to be done and we will engage them effectively so that we can come to some sort of compromise.’","1.
