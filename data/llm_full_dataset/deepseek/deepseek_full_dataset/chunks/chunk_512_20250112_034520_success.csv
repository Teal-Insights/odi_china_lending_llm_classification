The construction of this toll road was previously targeted for completion in 2019 but has stalled due to several problems. First, land acquisition in urban areas, relocation of high-voltage air lines (SUTT - 150 Kv), and other utilities such as gas pipelines, clean water pipes, medium-voltage cable lines, and distribution/network lines. Head of BPJT of the PUPR Ministry, Danang Parikesit, stated that the Covid-19 pandemic in early March 2020 and the implementation of Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) in DKI Jakarta have also affected the speed of implementation of construction work in the field.",NA,"# Sector
