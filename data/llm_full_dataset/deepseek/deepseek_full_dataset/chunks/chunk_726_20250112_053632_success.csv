Consequently, the SLPA commissioned at its own cost an ‘initial technical feasibility study’ in April 2010 for the reclamation of land south of the new breakwater. Around June 2010, an environmental impact assessment (EIA) study was commissioned by SLPA also at its own cost through the University of Moratuwa (UoM) for a reclamation area of 200 hectares. In October 2010, Sri Lanka’s Urban Development Authority (UDA) completed a master plan study based on the initial technical feasibility study and submitted a project proposal to the SLPA for consideration. Then, in April 2011, based on an unsolicited concept proposal submitted by China Communications Construction Company, Ltd.

The objective of the Thalpitigala Reservoir Project is to improve the agricultural productivity in the Badulla district by providing irrigation water while enhancing provision of safe drinking water and generation of hydropower. The scope of this project includes the provision of irrigation water to new and existing lands around 1400 hectares in the area through constructing upstream of the Battmedilla anicut in the Badulla district (within Uva Province), and the provision of safe drinking water facilities to Wasanagama, Madulla, Thetilla and Beramada villages in the Kandaketiya Divisonal Secretary's Division.   It also involves the construction of a hydropower station with a capacity of 15 MW that will generate 51 GWh of hydro power annually to fed the national grid. More specifically, this project will construct a concrete gravity dam in the mode of Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) across Uma Oya, approximately 3 km upstream of the existing Bathmedilla Anicut (near the village Hunuketiya), to establish a 15.56 mcm capacity reservoir at full supply level of 454 m.

AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate to be 2.954% by adding the average 6-month rate LIBOR rate (1.454%) in August 2017 to 1.5%. Given that the Katana Water Supply Project and the Thambuttegama Water Supply Project were financed through the same CDB loan agreement [ID#4510201701100001265], AidData assumes that the same all-in interest rate (2.954%) applies to CDB’s debt financing for the Katana Water Supply Project.","# Sector
