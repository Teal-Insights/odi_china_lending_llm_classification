Yunnan Construction Engineering Group was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation.   A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on April 3, 2007 and construction began on October 28, 2007. The project passed an on-site inspection in December 2008 and construction ended on March 31, 2009. The project was officially completed and handed over to the local authorities on September 22, 2009.    In support of the project, the Chinese Government also reportedly dispatched coaches and supplied various types of sporting equipment. The 25th Southeast Asian Games were successfully held in Vientiane in December 2009. However, this project was plagued by controversy when reports emerged that CDB issued the loan for the construction of the stadium on the condition that Suzhou Industrial Park Overseas Investment Company be granted access to a 50-year lease and the ability to develop an area of Vientiane into the ‘Vientiane New City’ project.   According to a report from the New York Times, “[a] public backlash [in 2008] over the financing of the Chinese stadium complex in Vientiane was considered by many as a milestone in public dissent toward the traditionally autocratic government. When rumors circulated that as part of the deal 50,000 Chinese would move into the Chinese-built industrial zone in Vientiane, government ministers were forced to call a news conference — a rare event for the Communist hierarchy. Deputy Prime Minister Somsavat Lengsavad, who is ethnically Chinese, explained details of the plan: […]   China Development Bank would finance the main sports complex in exchange for 1,600 hectares of land on the outskirts of Vientiane, which a Chinese company would convert into what was called the ‘New City Development Project.’ The government said it would lease the land for 50 years to Chinese developers with a possibility of an extension. But the announcement only served to kindle opposition to the plan. Farmers who lived on the land and wealthy residents who lived nearby commonly derided the project as ‘Chinese City,’ a term with a pejorative ring in a country where Chinese businesses have mushroomed in recent years.   In August 2008 the [Lao government] backed down and said the Chinese government would only receive 200 hectares, a small fraction of the original deal. More than a year later the [Lao government] refuses to divulge how it is compensating the Chinese government, which according to Laotian state media paid the full cost of the stadium complex.","1.

63224,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides $65 million preferential buyer’s credit for 230kV Hin Heup—Naxaythong Transmission Line and Substation Project,"In 2009, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Government of Laos signed a $65 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the 230kV Hin Heup—Naxaythong Transmission Line and Substation Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance 80% of the cost of a $72.2 million commercial (EPC) contract between China International Water and Electric Corporation (CWE) and Électricité du Laos (EDL), which was signed on April 4, 2008. EDL contributed the remaining 20% of financing.  The purpose of the project was to construct five electricity transmission lines — a 13 km 115kV transmission line from the Nam Lik 1-2 Hydropower Station to the Ban Don substation in Meuangfeuang district; a 31 km 115kV transmission line from the Nam Lik 1-2 Hydropower Station to the Hinheup (Hin Heup) substation in Hinheup district; a 17 km-long 115kV transmission line from Ban Don Substation in Meuangfeuang district to Hinheup (Hin Heup) substation in Hinheup district; a 12 km-long 115kV transmission line from Phontong substation in Chanthabouly district to Naxaithong substation;  and a 71.5 km-long  230kV transmission line from Hinheup substation to Naxaythong substation in Naxaithong district  — and the reconstruction of 4 substations (Ban Don 115/22kV substation, Hinheup (Hin Heup) 230/115/22kV substation, Naxaythong 230/115/22kV substation and Phongtong 115/22kV substation).   CWE was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Construction began on April 1, 2009. The Hinheup (Hin Heup) substation was put into operation on March 13, 2010. A project handover certificate was issued by EDL on November 26, 2012. The project was officially completed on December 1, 2012.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the 230kV Hin Heup—Naxaythong Transmission Line and Substation Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. Laos’ gross foreign exchange reserves were dangerously low between 2019 and 2021, hovering between 1.4 and 2.3 months of import cover, and total public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt increased from 68 percent of GDP ($12.5 billion) in 2019 to 88 percent in 2021 of GDP (or $14.5 billion). According to a report published by the World Bank in April 2022, ‘[t]he energy sector, mostly represented by Électricité du Laos (EDL), accounted for over 30 percent of total PPG debt in 2021. […] EDL’s debt service obligations [were] still unsustainable [at the time], with future debt service accounting for about two fifths of EDL’s total operating revenue.’ The Laotian authorities sought and secured debt service payment deferrals from their Chinese creditors in 2020 and 2021; according to the World Bank, ‘[d]ebt service deferrals granted by major lenders in 2020-2021 amounted around 3.6 percent of GDP in 2021’ and ’[a]s a result, actual debt service payments are estimated to have declined to 48 percent of total revenues in 2021, compared to 65 percent in the 2021 [Government of Laos] plan.’  The country’s central bank (Bank of the Lao P.D.R) also made a $300 million drawdown under its currency swap agreement with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in June 2020 — when its gross reserves stood at only 1.5 months of import cover and credit rating agencies warned of a high default probability. Then, in 2021, the short-term emergency loan from the PBOC was ‘rolled over’ for another year. Around the same time, a Chinese state-owned enterprise purchased a major public infrastructure asset in Laos—a large part of the country’s electricity transmission grid—from EDL as part of an apparent debt-for-equity swap. China Southern Power Grid Co. and EDL established a joint venture known as Électricité du Laos Transmission Company Limited (EDLT) in September 2020.  China Southern Power Grid Co. purchased a 90% ownership stake in EDLT in exchange for a $600 million fee (equity infusion). Then, in March 2021, EDLT signed a 25-year concession agreement, which made it responsible for management of the country’s high-voltage transmission network above 230 kilovolts. Independent observers suggested at the time that EDL would likely use the $600 million upfront payment from China Southern Power Grid Co. to service its outstanding debts to Chinese creditors, although this has not been independently confirmed. According to the World Bank’s International Debt Statistics, the Government of Laos was responsible for making average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $232 million between 2019 and 2019 and average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $60 million between 2020 and 2021 (a substantially lower figure due to payment deferrals); however, it expected to make average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth nearly $678 million over the next seven years (2022-2028).","1.

# Title
China Eximbank provides $65 million preferential buyer’s credit for 230kV Hin Heup—Naxaythong Transmission Line and Substation Project

# Description
In 2009, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Government of Laos signed a $65 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the 230kV Hin Heup—Naxaythong Transmission Line and Substation Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance 80% of the cost of a $72.2 million commercial (EPC) contract between China International Water and Electric Corporation (CWE) and Électricité du Laos (EDL), which was signed on April 4, 2008. EDL contributed the remaining 20% of financing.  The purpose of the project was to construct five electricity transmission lines — a 13 km 115kV transmission line from the Nam Lik 1-2 Hydropower Station to the Ban Don substation in Meuangfeuang district; a 31 km 115kV transmission line from the Nam Lik 1-2 Hydropower Station to the Hinheup (Hin Heup) substation in Hinheup district; a 17 km-long 115kV transmission line from Ban Don Substation in Meuangfeuang district to Hinheup (Hin Heup) substation in Hinheup district; a 12 km-long 115kV transmission line from Phontong substation in Chanthabouly district to Naxaithong substation;  and a 71.5 km-long  230kV transmission line from Hinheup substation to Naxaythong substation in Naxaithong district  — and the reconstruction of 4 substations (Ban Don 115/22kV substation, Hinheup (Hin Heup) 230/115/22kV substation, Naxaythong 230/115/22kV substation and Phongtong 115/22kV substation).   CWE was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Construction began on April 1, 2009. The Hinheup (Hin Heup) substation was put into operation on March 13, 2010. A project handover certificate was issued by EDL on November 26, 2012. The project was officially completed on December 1, 2012.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the 230kV Hin Heup—Naxaythong Transmission Line and Substation Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. Laos’ gross foreign exchange reserves were dangerously low between 2019 and 2021, hovering between 1.4 and 2.3 months of import cover, and total public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt increased from 68 percent of GDP ($12.5 billion) in 2019 to 88 percent in 2021 of GDP (or $14.5 billion). According to a report published by the World Bank in April 2022, ‘[t]he energy sector, mostly represented by Électricité du Laos (EDL), accounted for over 30 percent of total PPG debt in 2021. […] EDL’s debt service obligations [were] still unsustainable [at the time], with future debt service accounting for about two fifths of EDL’s total operating revenue.’ The Laotian authorities sought and secured debt service payment deferrals from their Chinese creditors in 2020 and 2021; according to the World Bank, ‘[d]ebt service deferrals granted by major lenders in 2020-2021 amounted around 3.6 percent of GDP in 2021’ and ’[a]s a result, actual debt service payments are estimated to have declined to 48 percent of total revenues in 2021, compared to 65 percent in the 2021 [Government of Laos] plan.’  The country’s central bank (Bank of the Lao P.D.R) also made a $300 million drawdown under its currency swap agreement with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in June 2020 — when its gross reserves stood at only 1.5 months of import cover and credit rating agencies warned of a high default probability. Then, in 2021, the short-term emergency loan from the PBOC was ‘rolled over’ for another year. Around the same time, a Chinese state-owned enterprise purchased a major public infrastructure asset in Laos—a large part of the country’s electricity transmission grid—from EDL as part of an apparent debt-for-equity swap. China Southern Power Grid Co. and EDL established a joint venture known as Électricité du Laos Transmission Company Limited (EDLT) in September 2020.  China Southern Power Grid Co. purchased a 90% ownership stake in EDLT in exchange for a $600 million fee (equity infusion). Then, in March 2021, EDLT signed a 25-year concession agreement, which made it responsible for management of the country’s high-voltage transmission network above 230 kilovolts. Independent observers suggested at the time that EDL would likely use the $600 million upfront payment from China Southern Power Grid Co. to service its outstanding debts to Chinese creditors, although this has not been independently confirmed.
