89437,BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES,TCMB makes RMB 990.6 million drawdown under currency swap agreement with PBOC in November 2016 (Linked to Project ID#89438 and #95620),"On February 21, 2012, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (TCMB or CBRT) and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) signed an RMB 10 billion (TRY 3 billion), bilateral currency swap agreement to facilitate trade and improve foreign currency liquidity in Turkey. The agreement was extended for an additional three years in November 2015 and the value of the currency swap was increased to RMB 12 billion. Then, on May 30, 2019, the agreement was extended for an additional three years and the value of the currency swap was increased to RMB 35 billion.   TCMB made (gross) drawdowns under the currency swap agreement equivalent to approximately RMB 990,675,000 (or 450 million Turkish liras or $142,547,235) on November 30, 2016, RMB 6,986,997,198 ($1 billion) in June 2019, and RMB 35 billion ($5,494,160,000) on June 15, 2021. The 2016 borrowing carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 0.5% margin (50 basis points). The 2019 and 2021 borrowings carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 2% margin (200 basis points). All borrowings carried a 1-year maturity.   TCMB’s 2016 drawdown is captured via Project ID#89437. Its 2019 drawdown is captured via Project ID#95620. Its 2021 drawdown is captured via Project ID#89438.","1. A bilateral currency swap (BCS) agreement — also known as a central bank liquidity swap agreement — is an agreement between the central banks of two countries to exchange cash flows in different currencies at predetermined rates over a specified period of time. Central banks participate in these agreements to facilitate bilateral trade settlements using their national currencies (rather than relying upon on a third-party currency such as the U.S. dollar), manage demands from their local banks, and provide liquidity support to financial markets. The party that draws down on the swap line becomes the borrower and the other party becomes lender. During the term of the swap, the party that draws down on the swap line makes either fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amount. If both parties draw down on the swap line, then both parties exchange fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amounts. The 5-step process of drawing upon a currency swap line with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) can described from the perspective of an importer in a given country (‘Country X’) seeking to settle trade with a Chinese firm in RMB. Step 1: The central bank of Country X and the PBOC activate their currency swap in advance, at which point each party deposits a specific amount of its currency in an account controlled by the other party (i.e. the central bank of Country X deposits local currency in an account controlled by the PBOC, and the PBOC deposits an equivalent amount in RMB in an account controlled by the central bank of Country X). Step 2: A firm in Country X that imports goods from China applies for an RMB-denominated loan from a domestic bank. Step 3: The domestic bank in Country X that receives the loan application then applies to its central bank for an RMB-denominated loan. After a review process, the central bank of Country X notifies the domestic bank applicant that its loan application was approved. The central bank of Country X subsequently requests that the PBOC transfer RMB funds from the central bank of Country X’s swap account within the PBOC to the loan applicant’s account with a corresponding bank in China. Step 4: The domestic bank in Country X directs the corresponding bank in China to transfer RMB funds into a Chinese exporter’s account, and the corresponding bank in China provides RMB funds to the Chinese exporter. Step 5: The importer in Country X repays the RMB-denominated loan at its maturity date. The domestic bank notifies the central bank of Country X of the repayment, and transfers RMB into the central bank’s account within the PBOC through the corresponding bank in China. For the central bank of Country X, the RMB deposit is an asset that should be recorded on its balance sheet as an official reserve asset denominated in RMB. The contra entry of this asset is the liability in the local currency of Country X that represents China’s claims in the central bank of Country X. This should be also recorded on the balance sheet of the central bank of Country X. At the time of the exchange of currencies, it should be recorded as an increase in assets and an increase in liabilities of the monetary authorities in the balance of payments. The reason why the PBOC uses this mechanism to provide renminbi liquidity to other central bank is to increase the speed, convenience, and volume of transactions between the two countries. More detailed information about currency swaps with the PBOC can be found at https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021210-print-pdf.ashx and https://thechinaguys.com/the-rise-of-the-renminbi-the-reality-of-bilateral-swap-agreements/ and https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2017/pdf/17-25a.pdf.2. AidData treats drawdowns under BCS agreements with the PBOC as collateralized loans because, in a BCS arrangement, the currency of the borrower is held as collateral while the lender receives interest on the amount drawn down by the borrower until repayment is made.3. AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate by adding 0.5% to average 6-month SHIBOR rate (3.2864%) in 2016.4. AidData has estimated the RMB value of the TCMB’s 2016 drawdown by multiplying 450 million by 2.2015 (using the average 2016 CNY:TRY exchange rate of 2.2015:1).5. Some sources suggest that a fourth drawdown took place in June 2020 (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-cenbank-china/turkish-central-bank-says-used-chinese-yuan-funding-for-first-time-idUSKBN23Q2AH and https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1192282.shtml). This issue warrants further investigation. 6. Most central banks publish their end-of-year outstanding PBOC swap debt, but only a few report detailed transaction-level data on drawdowns during the year. Therefore, if no information on drawings is available, AidData assumes that total drawdowns during the reporting period equal the amount outstanding at the end of the reporting period (and vice versa). Since the (de jure) maturities of PBOC swap drawings are 12 months or less, this creates a lower bound estimate for actual drawdowns under the PBOC swap line.   7. PBOC swap debt is frequently rolled over. In central bank reports where one can only observe the year-end outstanding amount, no distinction between rollovers and drawdowns is possible. In these cases, one can derive (new) drawdowns as the difference between the current and last year’s outstanding swap debt stock. This measure essentially captures net lending through the PBOC swap line.","# Sector

65848,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",Bank of China contributes $500 million to $1.3 billion syndicated loan for Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline Project,"In 2016, a syndicate of banks (led by Bank of China) issued a $1.3 billion loan to SOCAR Turkey Enerji A.S. (STEAS) — a Turkish subsidiary of the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) — for the Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP) Project. The Luxembourg branch of the Bank of China contributed $500 million to the syndicated loan. The proceeds of the loan were used by STEAS to purchase an ownership stake in the Trans-Anatolian Gas Pipeline Project (TANAP). Prior to this acquisition, Southern Gas Corridor Closed Joint Stock Company (SGC CJSC) held a 58 percent ownership stake in the TANAP Project. SGC CJSC is a joint investment vehicle that the Government of Azerbaijan and the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) established for the Southern Gas Corridor.   The purpose of the TANAP project is to transport natural gas produced from the Shah Deniz-2 field — located in the Caspian Sea in Azerbaijan — to Turkey and then onwards to Europe. It is the most important link in the Southern Gas Corridor, which also includes the Shah Deniz Stage 2 gas development project, the South Caucasus Pipeline, and the Trans Adriatic pipeline projects. With 1.2 trillion cubic meters in natural gas reserves, Shah Deniz 2 is the largest gas development project in Azerbaijan and forms the production stage of the Southern Gas Corridor. The total length of the South Caucasus Pipeline spanning Azerbaijan (443 km) and Georgia (248 km) is 691 km. The pipeline connects to TANAP in the village of Türkgözü at the Georgia-Turkey border. With additional investments, the annual capacity of the South Caucasus Pipeline was increased from 7 cubic meters of gas (bcma) to 23 bcma. TANAP is the longest and largest diameter natural gas pipeline in Turkey, the Middle East, and Europe, stretching 1,850 kilometers with 56-inch pipes in diameter, and includes a 17.6-km long sea crossing with twin pipelines. The entire system and the pipelines — except for the temporary facilities used during construction and above ground facilities — were designed and built for burial in soil. The pipeline runs from the Turkish border with Georgia, beginning in the Turkish village of Türkgözü in the Posof district of Ardahan, will run through 20 provinces including Kars, Erzurum, Erzincan, Bayburt, Gümüşhane, Giresun, Sivas, Yozgat, Kırşehir, Kırıkkale, Ankara, Eskişehir, Bilecik, Kütahya, Bursa, Balıkesir, Çanakkale, Tekirdağ and Edirne until it ends at the Greek border in the İpsala district of Edirne. The high-strength pipes and hot bends used in the project were produced specifically for TANAP and 80 percent of the mainline pipes were manufactured in Turkey.   The project includes 4 metering stations, 2 compressor stations, 11 pig stations, 49 block valve stations, and 2 gas outlets.
