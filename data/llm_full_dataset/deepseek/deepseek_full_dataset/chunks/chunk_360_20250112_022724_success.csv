Then, on September 20, 2019, the Chinese Government and the Government of El Salvador signed and Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA), which committed RMB 400 million ($62.24 million) of grant funding for multiple projects (including the National Library Construction Project, the Surfcity Potable Water, Roads, and Parks Project and the Lake Ilopango Water Treatment Plant Project). Approximately two months later, on December 3, 2019, during an official visit of President Xi Jinping to El Salvador, the Chinese Government and the Government of El Salvador signed another ETCA (see Project ID#71118), which committed an additional $500 million for multiple projects (including the National Library Construction Project, the Surfcity Potable Water, Roads, and Parks Project, the Lake Ilopango Water Treatment Plant Project, the Port of La Libertad Pier Expansion and Restoration Project, the Joya de Cerén Archaeological Site Restoration Project, and the National Stadium Construction Project).   The Chinese Government and the Government of El Salvador also signed an exchange of notes (‘canje de notas’) on the National Library Construction Project on December 3, 2019. Then, in May 2021, El Salvador’s legislative assembly ratified the September 20, 2019 ETCA. On February 3, 2022, the President of El Salvador Nayib Bukele announced that the National Library Construction Project woudl be ‘fully paid for by the government of the People's Republic of China, there will be no compensation from the Salvadoran government’ and that the project would cost $54 million.
