89454,BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES,SBP makes RMB 30 billion drawdown under currency swap agreement with PBOC in Fiscal Year 2021,"On December 23, 2011, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) signed an RMB 10 billion (PKR 140 billion), three-year bilateral currency swap agreement to facilitate trade and improve foreign currency liquidity in Pakistan. The agreement was renewed on December 23, 2014 for a period of three years with overall limit of RMB 10 billion (PKR 165 billion). It was further extended on May 23, 2018 for another three years, with the amount being increased to RMB 20 billion (PKR 351 billion). It was again extended (renewed) on July 31, 2020, during the Government of Pakistan’s Fiscal Year 2021, with maximum drawing rights increased to RMB 30 billion (PKR 720 billion). During the Government of Pakistan’s Fiscal Year 2013 (July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013), the SBP made a (gross) drawdown under the currency swap agreement equivalent to RMB 5 billion ($819.35 million). The Fiscal Year 2013 drawdown (borrowing), which is captured via Project ID#89452, carried a 1-year (12-month) maturity and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin. The PBOC credited RMB 5 billion to the SBP’s account held with PBOC, and the SBP credited PBOC's account held with SBP with the PKR equivalent of RMB 5 billion (PKR 70 billion). The SBP reportedly used the funds that it borrowed from PBOC to address its balance of payments (BOP) needs. In late 2013, the IMF expressed concern about the SBP’s heavy reliance on short-term currency swaps and forward contracts to boost gross foreign exchange reserves, and recommended that they be gradually scaled back to limit risk.  The SBP made additional (gross) drawdowns under its currency swap agreement with the PBOC between Fiscal Year 2014 (July 1, 2013 to June 30, 2014) and Fiscal Year 2022 (July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022): an RMB 6.5 billion drawdown in Fiscal Year 2014 that carried an estimated maturity of 9 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin, an RMB 10 billion drawdown in Fiscal Year 2015 that carried an estimated maturity of 4 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin, an RMB 10 billion drawdown in Fiscal Year 2016 that carried an estimated maturity of 4 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin, an RMB 10 billion drawdown in Fiscal Year 2017 that carried an estimated maturity of 4.5 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin, an RMB 20 billion drawdown in Fiscal Year 2018 that carried an estimated maturity of 7.5 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin, an RMB 20 billion in Fiscal Year 2019 that carried an estimated maturity of 7.5 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin, an RMB 20 billion in Fiscal Year 2020 that carried an estimated maturity of 7.5 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin, an RMB 30 billion in Fiscal Year 2021 that carried an estimated maturity of 7.5 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin, and an RMB 30 billion in Fiscal Year 2022 that carried an estimated maturity of 7.5 months and an interest rate of SHIBOR plus an unspecified margin. The SBP reportedly used the funds that it borrowed from the PBOC between Fiscal Year 2014 and Fiscal Year 2022 to address its BOP needs. In Fiscal Year 2021, the SBP reportedly used the funds that it borrowed from PBOC to address its BOP needs and repay foreign debts (in particular, maturing debts to Saudi Arabia).

A bilateral currency swap (BCS) agreement — also known as a central bank liquidity swap agreement — is an agreement between the central banks of two countries to exchange cash flows in different currencies at predetermined rates over a specified period of time. Central banks participate in these agreements to facilitate bilateral trade settlements using their national currencies (rather than relying upon on a third-party currency such as the U.S. dollar), manage demands from their local banks, and provide liquidity support to financial markets. The party that draws down on the swap line becomes the borrower and the other party becomes lender. During the term of the swap, the party that draws down on the swap line makes either fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amount. If both parties draw down on the swap line, then both parties exchange fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amounts.  The 5-step process of drawing upon a currency swap line with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) can described from the perspective of an importer in a given country (‘Country X’) seeking to settle trade with a Chinese firm in RMB. Step 1: The central bank of Country X and the PBOC activate their currency swap in advance, at which point each party deposits a specific amount of its currency in an account controlled by the other party (i.e. the central bank of Country X deposits local currency in an account controlled by the PBOC, and the PBOC deposits an equivalent amount in RMB in an account controlled by the central bank of Country X). Step 2: A firm in Country X that imports goods from China applies for an RMB-denominated loan from a domestic bank. Step 3: The domestic bank in Country X that receives the loan application then applies to its central bank for an RMB-denominated loan. After a review process, the central bank of Country X notifies the domestic bank applicant that its loan application was approved. The central bank of Country X subsequently requests that the PBOC transfer RMB funds from the central bank of Country X’s swap account within the PBOC to the loan applicant’s account with a corresponding bank in China. Step 4:  The domestic bank in Country X directs the corresponding bank in China to transfer RMB funds into a Chinese exporter’s account, and the corresponding bank in China provides RMB funds to the Chinese exporter. Step 5: The importer in Country X repays the RMB-denominated loan at its maturity date. The domestic bank notifies the central bank of Country X of the repayment, and transfers RMB into the central bank’s account within the PBOC through the corresponding bank in China. For the central bank of Country X, the RMB deposit is an asset that should be recorded on its balance sheet as an official reserve asset denominated in RMB. The contra entry of this asset is the liability in the local currency of Country X that represents China’s claims in the central bank of Country X. This should be also recorded on the balance sheet of the central bank of Country X. At the time of the exchange of currencies, it should be recorded as an increase in assets and an increase in liabilities of the monetary authorities in the balance of payments. The reason why the PBOC uses this mechanism to provide renminbi liquidity to other central bank is to increase the speed, convenience, and volume of transactions between the two countries. More detailed information about currency swaps with the PBOC can be found at https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021210-print-pdf.ashx and https://thechinaguys.com/the-rise-of-the-renminbi-the-reality-of-bilateral-swap-agreements/ and https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2017/pdf/17-25a.pdf.  2. AidData treats drawdowns under BCS agreements with the PBOC as collateralized loans because, in a BCS arrangement, the currency of the borrower is held as collateral while the lender receives interest on the amount drawn down by the borrower until repayment is made.  3. The precise maturity length that applies to the SBP’s FY21 borrowing is unknown. According to the SBP Fiscal Year 2021 Annual Report, ‘[the SBP] purchased and utilised CNY 20,000 million against PKR during the year ended June 30, 2020, with the maturity buckets of three months to 1 year. During the year, the overall limit of CNY 20,000 million has been further extended to CNY 30,000 million for a period of three years against PKR with the maturity buckets of three months to 1 year. These purchases have been fully utilised as at June 30, 2021. Interest is charged on outstanding balance at agreed rates.’ AidData has coded the maturity length as 7.5 months (0.625 years) for the time being. 4. SBP’s gross official foreign exchange reserves in Fiscal Year 2020-2021 amounted to $17.1 billion. The PBOC currency swap drawdown and deposits from China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) worth $4 billion contributed to these gross official foreign exchange reserves. 5. SBP’s drawdowns under the PBOC currency swap agreement are reportedly not reflected on the books of the federal government and are not treated as part of Pakistan’s external public debt.6. Most central banks publish their end-of-year outstanding PBOC swap debt, but only a few report detailed transaction-level data on drawdowns during the year. Therefore, if no information on drawings is available, AidData assumes that total drawdowns during the reporting period equal the amount outstanding at the end of the reporting period (and vice versa). Since the (de jure) maturities of PBOC swap drawings are 12 months or less, this creates a lower bound estimate for actual drawdowns under the PBOC swap line.  7. PBOC swap debt is frequently rolled over. In central bank reports where one can only observe the year-end outstanding amount, no distinction between rollovers and drawdowns is possible. In these cases, one can derive (new) drawdowns as the difference between the current and last year’s outstanding swap debt stock. This measure essentially captures net lending through the PBOC swap line.","# Sector
