A bilateral currency swap (BCS) agreement — also known as a central bank liquidity swap agreement — is an agreement between the central banks of two countries to exchange cash flows in different currencies at predetermined rates over a specified period of time. Central banks participate in these agreements to facilitate bilateral trade settlements using their national currencies (rather than relying upon on a third-party currency such as the U.S. dollar), manage demands from their local banks, and provide liquidity support to financial markets. The party that draws down on the swap line becomes the borrower and the other party becomes lender. During the term of the swap, the party that draws down on the swap line makes either fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amount. If both parties draw down on the swap line, then both parties exchange fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amounts. The 5-step process of drawing upon a currency swap line with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) can described from the perspective of an importer in a given country (‘Country X’) seeking to settle trade with a Chinese firm in RMB. Step 1: The central bank of Country X and the PBOC activate their currency swap in advance, at which point each party deposits a specific amount of its currency in an account controlled by the other party (i.e. the central bank of Country X deposits local currency in an account controlled by the PBOC, and the PBOC deposits an equivalent amount in RMB in an account controlled by the central bank of Country X). Step 2: A firm in Country X that imports goods from China applies for an RMB-denominated loan from a domestic bank. Step 3: The domestic bank in Country X that receives the loan application then applies to its central bank for an RMB-denominated loan. After a review process, the central bank of Country X notifies the domestic bank applicant that its loan application was approved. The central bank of Country X subsequently requests that the PBOC transfer RMB funds from the central bank of Country X’s swap account within the PBOC to the loan applicant’s account with a corresponding bank in China. Step 4: The domestic bank in Country X directs the corresponding bank in China to transfer RMB funds into a Chinese exporter’s account, and the corresponding bank in China provides RMB funds to the Chinese exporter. Step 5: The importer in Country X repays the RMB-denominated loan at its maturity date. The domestic bank notifies the central bank of Country X of the repayment, and transfers RMB into the central bank’s account within the PBOC through the corresponding bank in China. For the central bank of Country X, the RMB deposit is an asset that should be recorded on its balance sheet as an official reserve asset denominated in RMB. The contra entry of this asset is the liability in the local currency of Country X that represents China’s claims in the central bank of Country X. This should be also recorded on the balance sheet of the central bank of Country X. At the time of the exchange of currencies, it should be recorded as an increase in assets and an increase in liabilities of the monetary authorities in the balance of payments. The reason why the PBOC uses this mechanism to provide renminbi liquidity to other central bank is to increase the speed, convenience, and volume of transactions between the two countries. More detailed information about currency swaps with the PBOC can be found at https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021210-print-pdf.ashx and https://thechinaguys.com/the-rise-of-the-renminbi-the-reality-of-bilateral-swap-agreements/ and https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2017/pdf/17-25a.pdf.2. AidData treats drawdowns under BCS agreements with the PBOC as collateralized loans because, in a BCS arrangement, the currency of the borrower is held as collateral while the lender receives interest on the amount drawn down by the borrower until repayment is made.3. A 2017 Financial Note published by Suriname’s Ministry of Finance indicates that CBVS’s foreign liabilities increased by $155 million due to one or more drawdowns on its currency swap with the PBC between April 2015 and June 2015.4. Most central banks publish their end-of-year outstanding PBOC swap debt, but only a few report detailed transaction-level data on drawdowns during the year. Therefore, if no information on drawings is available, AidData assumes that total drawdowns during the reporting period equal the amount outstanding at the end of the reporting period (and vice versa). Since the (de jure) maturities of PBOC swap drawings are 12 months or less, this creates a lower bound estimate for actual drawdowns under the PBOC swap line.   5. PBOC swap debt is frequently rolled over. In central bank reports where one can only observe the year-end outstanding amount, no distinction between rollovers and drawdowns is possible. In these cases, one can derive (new) drawdowns as the difference between the current and last year’s outstanding swap debt stock. This measure essentially captures net lending through the PBOC swap line.   6. As of January 2023, the CBVS had not published annual reports for years 2020 and 2021 on its website. AidData treats RMB 1 billion as the gross drawdown value and amount outstanding in 2020 and 2021 given reporting of outstanding PBOC swap debt in IMF country reports and BOP statistics. A 2022 report by CBVS confirms that approximately $155 million in swap drawings were repaid in February 2022 (https://web.archive.org/web/20221004005835/https://sdmo.org/images/verslagen/Macro/Macrodata%202022-ENG.pdf).","# Sector

A bilateral currency swap (BCS) agreement — also known as a central bank liquidity swap agreement — is an agreement between the central banks of two countries to exchange cash flows in different currencies at predetermined rates over a specified period of time. Central banks participate in these agreements to facilitate bilateral trade settlements using their national currencies (rather than relying upon on a third-party currency such as the U.S. dollar), manage demands from their local banks, and provide liquidity support to financial markets. The party that draws down on the swap line becomes the borrower and the other party becomes lender. During the term of the swap, the party that draws down on the swap line makes either fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amount. If both parties draw down on the swap line, then both parties exchange fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amounts. The 5-step process of drawing upon a currency swap line with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) can described from the perspective of an importer in a given country (‘Country X’) seeking to settle trade with a Chinese firm in RMB. Step 1: The central bank of Country X and the PBOC activate their currency swap in advance, at which point each party deposits a specific amount of its currency in an account controlled by the other party (i.e. the central bank of Country X deposits local currency in an account controlled by the PBOC, and the PBOC deposits an equivalent amount in RMB in an account controlled by the central bank of Country X). Step 2: A firm in Country X that imports goods from China applies for an RMB-denominated loan from a domestic bank. Step 3: The domestic bank in Country X that receives the loan application then applies to its central bank for an RMB-denominated loan. After a review process, the central bank of Country X notifies the domestic bank applicant that its loan application was approved. The central bank of Country X subsequently requests that the PBOC transfer RMB funds from the central bank of Country X’s swap account within the PBOC to the loan applicant’s account with a corresponding bank in China. Step 4: The domestic bank in Country X directs the corresponding bank in China to transfer RMB funds into a Chinese exporter’s account, and the corresponding bank in China provides RMB funds to the Chinese exporter. Step 5: The importer in Country X repays the RMB-denominated loan at its maturity date. The domestic bank notifies the central bank of Country X of the repayment, and transfers RMB into the central bank’s account within the PBOC through the corresponding bank in China. For the central bank of Country X, the RMB deposit is an asset that should be recorded on its balance sheet as an official reserve asset denominated in RMB. The contra entry of this asset is the liability in the local currency of Country X that represents China’s claims in the central bank of Country X. This should be also recorded on the balance sheet of the central bank of Country X. At the time of the exchange of currencies, it should be recorded as an increase in assets and an increase in liabilities of the monetary authorities in the balance of payments. The reason why the PBOC uses this mechanism to provide renminbi liquidity to other central bank is to increase the speed, convenience, and volume of transactions between the two countries. More detailed information about currency swaps with the PBOC can be found at https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021210-print-pdf.ashx and https://thechinaguys.com/the-rise-of-the-renminbi-the-reality-of-bilateral-swap-agreements/ and https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2017/pdf/17-25a.pdf.2.

(2016) TOTAL NO. (423)] for the Suriname National Broadband Network Project. The PBC (loan) was approved by Parliament in December 2016 and it was amended and supplemented by an Amendment Agreement that was signed by the lender and borrower on July 3, 2017. The loan officially went into effect in November 2017 after several preconditions ('conditions precedent') were met by the borrower, including but not limited to the signing of a repayment mechanism (escrow account) agreement and the submission of a drawdown schedule approved by the lender.  The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 3% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.4% ($393,870.33) management fee, and a 0.4% commitment fee. The loan is scheduled for 21, equal, semi-annual repayments of $6,165,946.18 ($4,688,932.46 in principal and $1,477,013.72 in interest) on February 21 and August 21 of each year after the expiration of the grace period.   The Government of Suriname on-lent the proceeds of the loan to Telecommunicatiebefrijf Suriname (Telesur) -- Suriname’s state-owned telecommunications company -- on May 12, 2017. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $115,844,213.66 commercial (equipment supply and implementation service) contract between Telesur and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., which was signed on June 15, 2016.   Under the terms of a 2017 repayment mechanism (escrow account) agreement, the lender required that the borrower establish two escrow accounts: an SRD-denominated revenue account with a local Surinamese bank (FinaBank N.V) and a USD-denominated repayment reserve account with China Eximbank. Telesur was required to deposit at least 50% of its revenues, incomes, and funds (including broadband user revenues from the National Broadband Network Project) in the SRD-denominated revenue account. Telesur was also required to maintain a minimum cash balance in the repayment reserve account of $2,954,027.44 during the loan’s grace period (equivalent to total payable interest for one year or two semi-annual interest payments) and $9,377,864.92 during the loan’s repayment period (equivalent to total payable principal for one year or two semi-annual principal payments).

All loan disbursements were directly deposited in a bank account (No. 202000001000000167014) controlled by Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.  As of July 21, 2020, the loan had achieved a 95.6% disbursement rate ($94,165,765.55 out of $98,467,581.61).   The borrower made interest payments, principal payments, commitment fee payments, management fee payments in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.

It made an interest payment worth an unknown amount and a commitment fee payment worth an unknown amount on August 21, 2022. Then, on February 21, 2023, the borrower made its first (semi-annual) principal payment worth approximately $4,688,932 and an interest payment worth approximately $1,477,013.  The purpose of the project was to utilize fiber optic cables to expand electronic services across Suriname.  The project was divided into two phases. Phase 1 of the project (also known as the 'fiber-to-the-curb' phase) commenced in June 2017 and ended in October 2018. Phase 2 (also known as the 'fiber-to-the-home' phase) commenced in 2019. Phase 1 involved the replacement of old copper infrastructure with fiber optic cable and the placement of 253 additional multi-service access nodes in the broadband network and 35,000 households were successfully transferred to the higher bandwidth broadband network. While 85% of the $115,844,214 commercial contract was earmarked for phase 1 and phase 2, the remaining funds (approximately $17 million) from Telesur were earmarked for a Safe City project component, which involved the installation of 300 CCTV surveillance cameras on behalf of the Government of Suriname in the city of Paramaribo.   Huawei Technologies was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by Telesur. Multi Electric Systems was also involved as a subcontractor.  Project implementation commenced on June 9, 2017. Then, on December 28, 2018, the Safe City project component was officially launched. Telesur also installed the first CCTV camera’s in Paramaribo in partnership with Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd (who manufactured every camera) in August 2018. By February 2019, around 300 CCTV cameras had been installed in Paramaribo, and there were plans to expand the Safe City project component to Wanica, Albina and Nickerie.  On December 20, 2019, the National Broadband Network Project officially reached completion. Multiple regions reported increased bandwidth after the implementation of the project.   However, the National Broadband Network Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis its original objectives and the expectations of the lender. The Government of Suriname defaulted on its sovereign debt obligations three times during the COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2021, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that ‘Suriname owes arrears to China and India, which have provided assurances, although less specific than those provided by the Paris Club creditors, that they intend to work with Suriname towards a debt restructuring that will restore sustainability. China has consented to [IMF] financing notwithstanding these arrears. [...] An update will be circulated to the [IMF] Executive Board not later than one week prior to the scheduled Board consideration. On the basis of the Surinamese authorities’ commitment noted above, [IMF] staff expect that debt to China and India will be treated on comparable terms with other bilateral creditors. The arrears constitute a form of financing contribution to the program. China and India have acknowledged that Suriname will continue to run arrears on their official debt until a debt treatment can be agreed.’ The IMF also disclosed in December 2021 that ‘[t]he stock of external arrears is estimated to be at 11 percent of GDP by end-2021, including arrears of USD 61 million to China.’ Then, in February 2022, China Eximbank withdrew $1,477,013.72 (the monetary value of one semi-annual interest payment) from the repayment reserve account -- that was set up as a credit enhancement (and quasi-collateral arrangement) for the loan supporting the National Broadband Network Project -- in order to cover the cost of a missed interest payment by the borrower. At the time of the withdrawal, the standing cash balance of the repayment reserve account was approximately $2,954,027.44. China Eximbank also 'locked' ('froze') the SRD-denominated revenue account at a local Surinamese bank (FinaBank N.V) and replenished the repayment reserve account with funds that were deposited in the revenue account. After a period of negotiation, the revenue account was 'unlocked' ('unfrozen'). On August 21, 2022, Telesur paid its scheduled interest payment to China Eximbank in full. Then, in early 2023, Telesur subsequently sought and secured approval from the Government of Suriname to make its first principal and interest payment (worth $6,165,946.18) to China Eximbank in February 2023. Shortly after the borrower made the payment to the lender, the IMF informed Telesur and the Government of Suriname that the $6,165,946.18 principal and interest payment ought to be returned to the borrower to ensure 'comparable treatment' across external creditors (many of whom were still not being repaid). Telesur and the Government of Suriname then requested that China Eximbank return the $6,165,946.18 principal and interest payment in April 2023.  One month later, in May 2023, the IMF announced that ‘[a]n agreement was reached with Paris Club (PC) creditors for a two-step debt treatment in June 2022, and bilateral agreements with most of the PC creditors have been completed. An agreement-in-principle with bondholders was reached on May 4, 2023. The authorities are actively negotiating in good faith with China and India on a debt restructuring agreement.’ However, as of June 2023, China Eximbank had still not responded to the request for the return of the $6,165,946.18 principal and interest payment that was made in February 2023. At that time, the IMF also published a report estimating that the Government of Suriname's total principal and interest arrears to China had increased from $61 million to $107 million.  In a June 2, 2023 letter to the IMF, the President of Suriname explained that '[I]n January 2023, Telesur, the state-owned telecommunication company, made an erroneous payment of USD 7 million to [China Eximbank]. We commit not to make payments on any official bilateral debt under restructuring negotiation until the process is complete. We will make sure that the payments from Telesur to [China Eximbank] since the EFF approval will be reflected in the eventual debt restructuring with [China Eximbank] to ensure comparability treatment with other official creditors. We have taken steps to prevent any further such payments by Telesur. Telesur is no longer allowed to meet with [China Eximbank] representatives without MoFP officials being present. The Minister of Finance sent a letter to all the parties involved (including [China Eximbank]) such that no payment on the Telesur’s loan to [China Eximbank] will be made until a restructuring agreement within the parameters of the IMF EFF program have been reached, and a Presidential Decree [has been issued] stating that the debt restructuring process will be respected and payments by Telesur are prohibited until the debt restructuring agreement between Suriname and China has been reached.'","1.

China Eximbank provides $98.4 million preferential buyer’s credit for Suriname National Broadband Network Project (Linked to Project ID#70442)

# Description
On December 30, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of the Republic of Suriname signed a $98,467,581.61 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2016) TOTAL NO. (423)] for the Suriname National Broadband Network Project. The PBC (loan) was approved by Parliament in December 2016 and it was amended and supplemented by an Amendment Agreement that was signed by the lender and borrower on July 3, 2017. The loan officially went into effect in November 2017 after several preconditions ('conditions precedent') were met by the borrower, including but not limited to the signing of a repayment mechanism (escrow account) agreement and the submission of a drawdown schedule approved by the lender.  The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 3% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.4% ($393,870.33) management fee, and a 0.4% commitment fee. The loan is scheduled for 21, equal, semi-annual repayments of $6,165,946.18 ($4,688,932.46 in principal and $1,477,013.72 in interest) on February 21 and August 21 of each year after the expiration of the grace period.   The Government of Suriname on-lent the proceeds of the loan to Telecommunicatiebefrijf Suriname (Telesur) -- Suriname’s state-owned telecommunications company -- on May 12, 2017. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $115,844,213.66 commercial (equipment supply and implementation service) contract between Telesur and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., which was signed on June 15, 2016.   Under the terms of a 2017 repayment mechanism (escrow account) agreement, the lender required that the borrower establish two escrow accounts: an SRD-denominated revenue account with a local Surinamese bank (FinaBank N.V) and a USD-denominated repayment reserve account with China Eximbank. Telesur was required to deposit at least 50% of its revenues, incomes, and funds (including broadband user revenues from the National Broadband Network Project) in the SRD-denominated revenue account. Telesur was also required to maintain a minimum cash balance in the repayment reserve account of $2,954,027.44 during the loan’s grace period (equivalent to total payable interest for one year or two semi-annual interest payments) and $9,377,864.92 during the loan’s repayment period (equivalent to total payable principal for one year or two semi-annual principal payments).  The lender made the first loan disbursement (worth $4,877,322.70) on December 1, 2017, the second loan disbursement (worth $11,447,025.58) between December 1, 2018 and June 1, 2018, the third loan disbursement (worth $3,818,454.80) on June 1, 2018, the fourth loan disbursement (worth $6,840,268.83) on December 7, 2018, the fifth loan disbursement (worth $23,340,009.72) on December 7, 2018, the sixth loan disbursement (worth $2,890,986.27) on March 1, 2019, the seventh loan disbursement (worth $12,123,458.55) on March 1, 2019, the eight loan disbursement (worth $12,972,783.30) on May 21, 2019, the ninth loan disbursement (worth $2,468,279.95) on May 21, 2019, the tenth loan disbursement (worth $9,202,364.93) on August 27, 2019, the eleventh loan disbursement (worth $299,774.30) on December 13, 2019, the twelfth loan disbursement (worth $3,885,036.62) on December 13, 2019, and the thirteenth loan disbursement (worth $4,298,892.76) on March 19, 2020. All loan disbursements were directly deposited in a bank account (No. 202000001000000167014) controlled by Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.  As of July 21, 2020, the loan had achieved a 95.6% disbursement rate ($94,165,765.55 out of $98,467,581.61).   The borrower made interest payments, principal payments, commitment fee payments, management fee payments in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. On February 21, 2018, the borrower made an interest payment worth $4,623.76 and a commitment fee payment worth $56,812.97. It made an interest payment worth $255,771.72, a commitment fee payment worth $163,926.35, and a management fee payment worth $3,333.33 on August 21, 2018. It made an interest payment worth $390,477.10, a commitment fee payment worth $149,247.88, and a management fee payment worth $3,333.33 on February 21, 2019. It made an interest payment worth $956,817.01, a commitment fee payment worth $70,453.65, and a management fee payment worth $3,333.33 on August 21, 2019.  It made an interest payment worth $1,349,640.03, a commitment fee payment worth $21,359.50, and a management fee payment worth $3,333.33 on February 21, 2020. It made an interest payment worth $1,428,180.78 (based on the loan's disbursed balance of $94,165,165.55), a commitment fee payment worth $8,699.23 (based on the loan's undisbursed balance of $4,301,816.06), and a management fee payment worth $3,333.33 on August 21, 2020.  It made an interest payment worth $1,443,875.07 and a commitment fee payment worth $4,636.40 on February 21, 2021. It made an interest payment worth an unknown amount and a commitment fee payment worth an unknown amount on August 21, 2021. It made an interest payment worth an unknown amount and a commitment fee payment worth an unknown amount on February 21, 2022. It made an interest payment worth an unknown amount and a commitment fee payment worth an unknown amount on August 21, 2022. Then, on February 21, 2023, the borrower made its first (semi-annual) principal payment worth approximately $4,688,932 and an interest payment worth approximately $1,477,013.  The purpose of the project was to utilize fiber optic cables to expand electronic services across Suriname.  The project was divided into two phases. Phase 1 of the project (also known as the 'fiber-to-the-curb' phase) commenced in June 2017 and ended in October 2018. Phase 2 (also known as the 'fiber-to-the-home' phase) commenced in 2019. Phase 1 involved the replacement of old copper infrastructure with fiber optic cable and the placement of 253 additional multi-service access nodes in the broadband network and 35,000 households were successfully transferred to the higher bandwidth broadband network. While 85% of the $115,844,214 commercial contract was earmarked for phase 1 and phase 2, the remaining funds (approximately $17 million) from Telesur were earmarked for a Safe City project component, which involved the installation of 300 CCTV surveillance cameras on behalf of the Government of Suriname in the city of Paramaribo.   Huawei Technologies was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by Telesur. Multi Electric Systems was also involved as a subcontractor.  Project implementation commenced on June 9, 2017. Then, on December 28, 2018, the Safe City project component was officially launched. Telesur also installed the first CCTV camera’s in Paramaribo in partnership with Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd (who manufactured every camera) in August 2018. By February 2019, around 300 CCTV cameras had been installed in Paramaribo, and there were plans to expand the Safe City project component to Wanica, Albina and Nickerie.  On December 20, 2019, the National Broadband Network Project officially reached completion. Multiple regions reported increased bandwidth after the implementation of the project.   However, the National Broadband Network Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis its original objectives and the expectations of the lender. The Government of Suriname defaulted on its sovereign debt obligations three times during the COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2021, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that ‘Suriname owes arrears to China and India, which have provided assurances, although less specific than those provided by the Paris Club creditors, that they intend to work with Suriname towards a debt restructuring that will restore sustainability. China has consented to [IMF] financing notwithstanding these arrears. [...] An update will be circulated to the [IMF] Executive Board not later than one week prior to the scheduled Board consideration. On the basis of the Surinamese authorities’ commitment noted above, [IMF] staff expect that debt to China and India will be treated on comparable terms with other bilateral creditors.
