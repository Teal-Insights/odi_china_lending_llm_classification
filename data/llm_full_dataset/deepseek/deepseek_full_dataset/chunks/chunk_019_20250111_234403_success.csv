Then, in 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of Cape Verde signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due in 2021 under one or more loan agreements. The total estimated suspension amount was $2,710,000 ($2,062,000 in principal payments and $647,000 in interest payments).   However, at the time that the parties signed the debt suspension agreement, they both acknowledged that the total suspension amount would ultimately be determined at the end of the suspension period (since loan disbursements could be made during the suspension period and the lender agreed to suspend the payment of interest accrued on any disbursements during the suspension period). The lender and borrower agreed that the suspension of debt service would be undertaken on a net present value (NPV)-neutral basis. Therefore, the borrower agreed to pay interest accrued on the amount outstanding under the total suspension amount (‘Suspension Interest’) by paying the Suspension Interest on the amount outstanding under each loan agreement’s suspension amount at the same rate of interest set forth in the original loan agreement.    Under the terms of the debt suspension agreement, the lender and the borrower also agreed that ‘[t]he suspension interest on the amount outstanding under the Suspension Amount concerning each Loan Agreement shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and a year of 360 days, from and including the Repayment Date/Repayment Date of Principal and Interest falling within the Suspension Period to the date of payment in full of the corresponding Suspension Amount, and shall be paid in arrears on each Interest Payment Date under the corresponding Loan Agreement.’ The borrower also agreed that (1) ‘it shall continue to perform all its obligations […] under the Loan Agreements as supplemented and amended by [the debt suspension agreement]’; (2) ‘it shall use the created fiscal space to increase social, health, or economic spending in response to the COVID-19 crisis […]’ and ‘work closely with the International Financial Institutions who are expected to put in place a monitoring system’;  (3) ‘it shall disclose to the Lender all Public Sector Financial Commitments (as defined in the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 (GFSM2014)), respecting commercially sensitive information’; and (4) ‘it shall contract no new non-concessional debt during the Suspension Period, other than agreements under the DSSI’.","1. AidData assumes that the same basic terms and conditions that governed China Eximbank’s DSSI (debt suspension) agreement with other governments also applied to its DSSI agreement that it signed with the Government of Cape Verde.

Then, in 2021, a group of Chinese state-owned banks provided a $660 million syndicated loan to Angkor International Airport Investment (Cambodia) Co., Ltd. for the Siem Reap Angkor International Airport Project. The lenders were China Development Bank (as the Arranger, the Agent, and the Leading Bank); Yunnan Branch of Export-Import Bank of China (as the Joint Lead Bank); China Construction Bank (as a Participant Bank); Phnom Penh Branch of Bank of China (as a Participant Bank); and Phnom Penh Branch of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (as a Participant Bank). China Development Bank Yunnan Branch conducted multi-party communications with the Cambodian Government, enterprises, and financial institutions, and took the lead in setting up a $660 million syndicated loan to support the construction of the airport. The maturity length of the loan is 20 years. The total project cost is $880 million and it is being financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25. Yunnan Investment Group made a $220 million equity investment in this project (see Project ID#66058).

Upon completion, the new airport is expected to be able to handle 7 million passengers annually. The existing Angkor International Airport in Siem Reap is only 5 kilometers away from Angkor Wat (a Buddhist temple and the largest religious monument in the world) and has only one runway.

Construction began on March 15, 2020. However, project implementation was halted for an unidentified reason in 2020 (most likely the Covid-19 pandemic). However, in a meeting with H.E.
