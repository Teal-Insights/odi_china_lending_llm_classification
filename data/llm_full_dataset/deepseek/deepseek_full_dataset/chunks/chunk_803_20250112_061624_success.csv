85340,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides loan for Sekong 2 Substation Transmission & Transformation Project,"On September 8, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Laos signed a loan agreement for the Sekong 2 Substation Transmission & Transformation Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to at least partially finance a $317 million EPC contract between Electricite Du Laos and Pinggao Group Co Ltd (a subsidiary of State Grid Corporation of China), which was signed on December 17, 2015.   The purpose of the project is to construct or expand seven 500kV/230kV and 230 kV/115 kV substations, including the Tonpheung transformer substation and the Huayxay substation. It also involves the construction of seven 230 kV and 115 kV transmission lines, including a 48-km transmission line from Huayxay to Tonpheung.   Pinggao Group Co Ltd is the general (EPC) contractor responsible for implementation. However, PowerChina Hubei Engineering Co., Ltd and China Energy Engineering Group Guangdong Electric Power Design Institute Co., Ltd (GEDI) are also involved in project design and implementation.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Sekong 2 Substation Transmission & Transformation Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. Laos’ gross foreign exchange reserves were dangerously low between 2019 and 2021, hovering between 1.4 and 2.3 months of import cover, and total public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt increased from 68 percent of GDP ($12.5 billion) in 2019 to 88 percent in 2021 of GDP (or $14.5 billion). According to a report published by the World Bank in April 2022, ‘[t]he energy sector, mostly represented by Électricité du Laos (EDL), accounted for over 30 percent of total PPG debt in 2021. […] EDL’s debt service obligations [were] still unsustainable [at the time], with future debt service accounting for about two fifths of EDL’s total operating revenue.’ The Laotian authorities sought and secured debt service payment deferrals from their Chinese creditors in 2020 and 2021; according to the World Bank, ‘[d]ebt service deferrals granted by major lenders in 2020-2021 amounted around 3.6 percent of GDP in 2021’ and ’[a]s a result, actual debt service payments are estimated to have declined to 48 percent of total revenues in 2021, compared to 65 percent in the 2021 [Government of Laos] plan.’  The country’s central bank (Bank of the Lao P.D.R) also made a $300 million drawdown under its currency swap agreement with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in June 2020 — when its gross reserves stood at only 1.5 months of import cover and credit rating agencies warned of a high default probability. Then, in 2021, the short-term emergency loan from the PBOC was ‘rolled over’ for another year. Around the same time, a Chinese state-owned enterprise purchased a major public infrastructure asset in Laos—a large part of the country’s electricity transmission grid—from EDL as part of an apparent debt-for-equity swap. China Southern Power Grid Co. and EDL established a joint venture known as Électricité du Laos Transmission Company Limited (EDLT) in September 2020.  China Southern Power Grid Co. purchased a 90% ownership stake in EDLT in exchange for a $600 million fee (equity infusion). Then, in March 2021, EDLT signed a 25-year concession agreement, which made it responsible for management of the country’s high-voltage transmission network above 230 kilovolts. Independent observers suggested at the time that EDL would likely use the $600 million upfront payment from China Southern Power Grid Co. to service its outstanding debts to Chinese creditors, although this has not been independently confirmed. According to the World Bank’s International Debt Statistics, the Government of Laos was responsible for making average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $232 million between 2019 and 2019 and average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $60 million between 2020 and 2021 (a substantially lower figure due to payment deferrals); however, it expected to make average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth nearly $678 million over the next seven years (2022-2028).","1.

On September 15th, 2021, the first unit of the seventh-level hydropower station on the Nam Ou River in Laos has successfully entered into a 72-hour trial operation, marking that all power stations in the Nam Ou River basin have achieved the power generation target and will start the period of joint commissioning and transportation. The Nam Ou River Power Plant was completed on September 29, 2021 with a live ceremony to commemorate its completion. Under the terms of a concession agreement with the Government of Laos, Powerchina Resources Ltd. has agreed to transfer the Phase 2 project to the Government of Laos after 29 years of operation.

However, official sources indicate the CDB issued a $660 million loan in 2016. 4. The China Eximbank loan that supported this project is not included in the Overseas Development Finance Dataset that Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center published in December 2020. 5. Some sources refer to Nam Ou Power Co., Ltd. as a wholly owned subsidiary of Powerchina Resources Ltd., while others claim that Nam Ou Power Co., Ltd. is jointly owned by Powerchina Resources Ltd. (990%) and EDL-Gen (10%). This issue merits further investigation. 6. Some sources refer to an 1156 MW Nam Ou Hydropower Station Project or an 1156 Nam Ou River Basin Hydropower Project — worth $2 billion to $2.7 billion — with seven separate cascade power stations and a total installed capacity of 1,272 MW or 1,156 MW. However, these are references to the larger project that comprises Phase I 540MW Nam Ou 2, 5, 6 Cascade Project (captured in Project ID#63762) and the Phase II 616MW Nam Ou 1, 3, 4, and 7 Cascade Project (captured in Project ID#67486).7.

CCB contributes $265 million to syndicated buyer’s credit loan for Phase 2 of Nam Ou Hydropower Project (Linked to Project ID#67486, ID#73303, & ID#73301)

# Description
On August 31, 2015, Powerchina Resources Ltd. and the Government of Laos signed a Franchise Agreement and Power Purchase Agreement for Phase 2 of the Nam Ou Hydropower Project in Beijing. Then, in September 2015, Powerchina Resources Ltd. created a wholly-owned subsidiary and special purpose vehicle called the Nam Ou Power Co., Ltd. in order to finance, develop, implement, and operate Phase 2 of the Nam Ou Hydropower Project on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis. The total cost of Phase 2 was $1.644 billion and it was financed with a mix of debt and equity.   Then, on September 8, 2016, Nam Ou Power Co., Ltd. signed a $1.3 billion syndicated buyer’s credit loan agreement with China Development Bank, China Eximbank, and China Construction Bank. CDB contributed $770 million (captured in Project ID#67486) and China Eximbank and China Construction Bank jointly contributed $530 million (captured in Project ID#73301 and ID#98809). The loan carries a 20 year maturity. Nam Ou Power Co., Ltd. also purchased buyer’s credit insurance from Sinosure. Additionally, Powerchina Resources Ltd. made a $340 million equity contribution to the project (captured in Project ID#73303).   The purpose of Phase 2 was to construct four hydropower stations — the 180MW Nam Ou 1 hydropower station, the 210MW Nam Ou 3 hydropower station, the 132MW Nam Ou 4 hydropower station, and 210MW Nam Ou 7 hydropower station — on the Nam Ou River in Luangprabang Province and Phongsaly Province. Upon completion, Nam Ou 1 will have a total reservoir capacity of 1.18 × 108 million cubic meters and generate 180MW from four sets of turbines and generators. Nam Ou 3 will have a total reservoir capacity of 218 million cubic meters and generate 210MW from three turbo-generator sets. Nam Ou 4 will have a total reservoir capacity of 142 million m3 and produce electricity from three turbo-generators with a total capacity of 132MW. Nam Ou 7 will include two turbo-generators sets with a total capacity of 210MW.   The precise locational coordinates of Nam Ou 1 are 20.0883°N 102.265379°E.  The precise locational coordinates of Nam Ou 3 are 20.695251°N 102.665404°E.  The precise locational coordinates of Nam Ou 4 are 21.120153°N 102.494173°E.  The precise locational coordinates of Nam Ou 7 are 21.120153°N 102.494173°E.   PowerChina Kunming Engineering Corp Ltd is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A project commencement ceremony was held on April 28, 2016. Then, China Eximbank conducted an on-site, post-loan project inspection on August 31, 2019. On December 26, 2019, a ceremony to start the first power generation unit was held.
