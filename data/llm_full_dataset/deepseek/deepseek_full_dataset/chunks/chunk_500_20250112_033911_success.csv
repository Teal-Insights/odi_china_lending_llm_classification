60762,WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION,China Exmbank provides RMB 1.07 billion governmental concessional loan for Mekelle City Water Supply Project (Linked to Project ID#66045),"On May 10, 2018, the Chinese Government and the Government of Ethiopia signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the Mekelle City Water Supply Project. Then, on June 13, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed an RMB 1,070,000,000 (ETB 4,593,582,599 or $156 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Mekelle City Water Supply Project (captured via Project ID#60762). On the same day, China’s Ministry of Commerce and the Government of Ethiopia signed an RMB 540,000,000 (ETB 2,318,256,639) interest-free loan agreement for the Mekelle City Water Supply Project (captured via Project ID#66045). According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the GCL carries a 2% interest rate. However, the other borrowing terms of the GCL and the interest-free loan are unknown.  Ethiopia’s House of Representatives ratified both loan agreements on April 6, 2019. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the GCL and the interest-free loan to finance a commercial contract with the Government of Ethiopia and China Gezhouba Group Co. Ltd. (CGGC).   According to the Government of Ethiopia’s AMP, two disbursements took place in 2020: an ETB 274,488,122 disbursement on April 2, 2020, and an ETB 682,257,203 disbursement on September 1, 2020. However, it is unclear if these disbursements took place through the RMB 1,070,000,000 (ETB 4,593,582,599) China Eximbank loan, the RMB 540,000,000 (ETB 2,318,256,639) MOFCOM loan, or both loans.   This project involves the construction of the Gereb-Giba Dam on the Giba river and the installation of a water pipeline network to supply water to households, industrial parks and factories in and around the city of Mekelle (the capital of Ethiopia's northern Tigray regional state). Upon completion, the project is expected to meet the water needs of the estimated 400,000 residents of Mekelle. It is also expected to generate a maximum storage capacity of 363 million cubic meters during the rainy season, an annual water supply of 53.65 million cubic meters, and an average daily water supply of 124.43 thousand cubic meters. The project was also expected to create 1500 jobs for local people during the construction phase.   CGGC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on September 22, 2019. Then, on March 17, 2020, a river closure ceremony took place and dozens of heavy trucks poured dirt and stone into the Giba river. The Chinese Ambassador to Ethiopia, Mr. Tan Jian, and Mr. Debretsion, President of Tigray Regional State attended the closure ceremony, which marked the beginning of a new phase of the project (dam main body filling). Then, on November 11, 2020, after a violent conflict erupted between the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and the Government of Ethiopia, the Chinese Embassy in Ethiopia evacuated 600 Chinese workers (including CGGC workers assigned to the Mekelle City Water Supply Project) from Tigray State. The originally scheduled project completion date was March 1, 2023.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Mekelle City Water Supply Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension).

As of September 2021, there was no evidence that construction had begun on the pipeline. This implementation delay was reportedly related to political and security risks to the oil and gas sector in the region. POLY-GCL Petroleum Group Holdings Limited is expecting to generate $1 billion of revenue in gas exports during the pipeline’s first operational year, due to the discovery of 7 to 8 billion cubic trillion feet (TFC) of natural gas in Ethiopia's Somali regional state. The Ethiopian Government expects that production will commence in 2023.","1. This project is also known as the Poly-GCL Oil and Gas Project, the Ethiopia-Djibouti Oil & Gas Project, the Ethiopia-Djibouti Natural Gas Project, and the Ogaden–Djibouti Pipeline Construction Project.

AidData has estimated the face value of the loan (i.e. transaction amount) by taking 70% of the total project cost ($3.68 billion). 3. POLY-GCL Petroleum Group Holdings Limited [保利协鑫石油天然气集团控股有限公司 or 协鑫（集团）控股有限公司] was legally incorporated on November 7, 2012. Some sources suggest that the Ethiopian Government holds (or held) a 15% ownership stake in POLY-GCL Petroleum Group Holdings Limited. However, most sources identify POLY-GCL Petroleum Group Holdings Limited as a joint venture of China Poly Group Corporation and Golden Concord Group Limited (GCL).4. According to a letter issued by Ethiopia’s Office of the Prime Minister on June 5, 2019, Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed lifted restrictions imposed by the National Bank of Ethiopia compelling international oil and gas companies to hold a local foreign currency account. The condition was the major hurdle that restricted the country from getting foreign direct investments in the oil and mining sector, according to Samuel Urkato (PhD), minister of Mines & Petroleum. 'Many companies that want to invest in the country have backed off due to this restraint,' Samuel told Fortune. The new decision was passed after having a serious debate with the officials of the National Bank of Ethiopia,” Samuel said. The companies were also frustrated by the directive, which limited them from obtaining loans from international creditors. “Since international creditors require the forex account of borrowers as a requirement for loan approval, the companies, especially Poly-GCL, have been continuously calling for the reversal of the directive,' said Samuel. Poly GCL, which discovered crude oil reserves in three wells in the Hilala region and launched test production in June 2018, has been filing complaint letters with the government for the past two years. The companies have been transferring foreign currency into their local accounts to finance their oil and gas exploration activities and withdrawing cash in local currency for their expenditures.","# Sector
