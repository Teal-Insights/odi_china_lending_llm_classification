The supplies were to be granted by a group of organizations consisting primarily of Chinese government institutions and state-owned enterprises.  The entire batch included the following supplies: 5,000 sets of protective clothing, 66,000 N95 masks, 130,000 medical masks, 2,000 goggles, 5,000 isolation suits, 20,000 pairs of gloves, 2,500 reagents (testing kits), 550 hand-held forehead thermometers, and 3 sets of temperature monitoring equipment.  The group of donors included the following organizations: the Hangzhou Municipal People's Government; the Xiaoshan District People's Government; the People's Government of Louta Town, (in the Xiaoshan District, Hangzhou Municipality); the China Shenzhen Mammoth Foundation; the BGI Group; the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Argentina Branch; Bank of China, Buenos Aires Branch; COFCO Argentina Branch; China Communications Group, Argentina Branch; National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm); Huawei Argentina; Gold Wind Technology, Argentina Branch; and the Argentina-China Trade and Investment Promotion Association.  The materials granted by each donor arrived on different dates. On March 27, 2020, the materials donated by the Hangzhou Municipal Government, the Xiaoshan District Government, and the Louta Town Government arrived in Buenos Aires and were handed over to officials from the Argentine Ministry of Health. The Chinese Embassy in Argentina reported that these three donors provided the ""main part"" of the supplies included in the first batch. Both the Chinese Embassy and reporting from La Nación indicated multiple shipments were used to transfer this part of the donation.   According to the Argentine Ministry of Health's response to a public information request, as reported by La Nación, the Hangzhou Municipal Government's portion of the donation included 50,000 N95 masks, 105,000 medical masks, 2000 goggles (Hangzhou Shanyou Medical Equipment Co. brand), and 1000 testing kits (Shanghai ZJ Bio-Tech Co Ltd. brand).","1. This project is linked to Project ID#91387, which itself links to the contributions of all other donors that contributed to the first batch of supplies committed on March 17, 2020.2. AidData has estimated the transaction amount for this donation based on price catalogues from the World Health Organization (WHO). Please see the TUFF Methodology for additional details.3. It is possible that the donation amount attributed to Hangzhou in La Nación's reporting/per the information request from the Ministry of Health includes the amount of supplies donated by the Xiaoshan District Government in Hangzhou and the Louta Town Government. One piece of evidence to suggest this is that the number of masks said to be donated by Hangzhou (50,000 K95 + 105,000 surgical) and Xiaoshan (60,000 of an unspecified type, likely surgical) exceeds the total in the first batch. Further, there is significant ambiguity regarding the timeline – Xiaoshan's donation is reported on as if it hasn't arrived yet/'will arrive' on dates after the donation is said to have arrived in Chinese official sources.On the other hand, the donation portion attributed to Xiaoshan in Chinese Embassy sources reportedly includes thermometers, which are not included in the La Nación report about Hangzhou's donation, but are in follow up reporting about Xiaoshan's. For the time being, AidData assumes that, at the very least, all surgical masks from the first batch of supplies were donated by either the Xiaoshan District in Hangzhou, or the Hangzhou Municipality as a whole. However, this issue warrants further investigation.","# Sector

However, the precise amount donated by the Louta Town Government is unknown. For the time being, AidData estimates their contribution was worth about USD 6285.36, or, in terms of supplies, about 3,200 N95 masks, 395 isolation suits, 3,700 pairs of gloves, and 90 thermometers.","1. For the donors that are listed as contributors to this first batch of materials but provided an unknown number of supplies, AidData has applied the equal contribution assumption. The amount that can be directly attributed to a particular donor has been subtracted out from the total, and the value of the remaining supplies has been divided equally between the remaining donors.Five total donors had an unknown contribution: Louta Town Government (#93424), China Communications Group Argentina (#93457), Sinopharm (#91463), Goldwind Technology Argentina (less than 50% Chinese state ownership, no project created), and Argentina-China Trade & Investment Promotion Association (includes an unknown mix of private/state-owned enterprises, AidData does not currently track financing from these types of organizations as projects). Therefore, the unaccounted for supplies' value has been divided by five.   2. Although the majority of the donation is said to have been provided by the Hangzhou Municipal Government, the Xiaoshan District Government, and the Louta Town Government, there is no non-arbitrary mechanism to decide how to increase the estimated contribution for Louta Town. Thus, the equal contribution assumption has still been applied for consistency. However, this does indicate that the number of supplies donated by China Communications Group in this project may be inflated to some extent, as will the estimates listed for Sinopharm, Goldwind Technology Argentina, and Argentina-China Trade & Investment Promotion Association.3. The calculations for the portion of the donation provided by the Louta Town Government are as follows: 5,000 sets of protective clothing - 3,500 donated by ICBC Argentina (#93425) - 1,500 donated by Bank of China Buenos Aires (# 93427) = 0 sets of protective clothing66,000 N95 masks - 50,000 N95 masks donated by Hangzhou Municipal Government (#93423) = 16,000 N95 masks130,000 medical masks - 60,000 donated by Xiaoshan District Government (#93456) - 105,000 donated by Hangzhou Municipal Government (#93423) = -35,000 surgical masks.

This total has been divided by the number of donors whose contributions are unknown (five) under the assumption that each made an equal contribution. Thus, the value of the Louta Town Government's estimated contribution is USD 6285.36. ($31,426.80 / 5 = 6285.36)","# Sector

It is assumed that the donation described in the Chinese Embassy Tweet and Sina's article on ICBC's contributions to Argentina during the pandemic is the one that is part of the first batch of medical supplies. ICBC Argentina is listed as a donor by the Chinese Embassy, and given the lack of evidence of other PPE (rather than cash) donated by ICBC Argentina that could be ICBC Argentina's contribution to the first batch, it seems likely the 3,500 sets of medical clothes referenced in Sina's article is the contribution. References to the donation being coordinated by the Embassy and the donation being provided to the Argentine Ministry of Health in the Sina article also indicate that this is the case. The donation also arrived shortly after (March 26th) the batch was committed.3. The Chinese word for the kind of article donated by ICBC Argentina is '套防护服', which appears in both the Sina and Chinese Embassy articles. It is translated in this set of linked projects as 'sets of protective clothing'. This is separate from '件隔离服', which is translated in this set of linked projects as 'isolation suits', of which 1754 were donated by the Xiaoshan district government (see project #93456), 1275 were assumed to be donated by COFCO Argentina (see project #93455), and none were donated by ICBC Argentina. 套防护服 were also assumed to be donated by Bank of China, Buenos Aires branch (see project #93427).

The Chinese Embassy in Argentina reported that these three donors provided the ""main part"" of the supplies included in the first batch. The Chinese Embassy indicated that multiple shipments were used to transfer this part of the donation.   More specifically, the Xiaoshan District Government likely provided 60,000 medical masks, 1754 isolation suits, 100 thermometers, and 1500 gloves, per reporting from a draft resolution from Argentina's National Chamber of Deputies.   However, it is also possible that the Xiaoshan District Government's portion of the donation was included in Hangzhou Municipal Government's portion of the donation, which included 50,000 N95 masks, 105,000 medical masks, 2000 goggles, and 1000 testing kits.","1. It is possible that the donation amount attributed to Hangzhou in La Nación's reporting/per the information request from the Ministry of Health includes the amount of supplies donated by the Xiaoshan District Government in Hangzhou and the Louta Town Government. One piece of evidence to suggest this is that the number of masks said to be donated by Hangzhou (50,000 K95 + 105,000 surgical) and Xiaoshan (60,000 of an unspecified type, likely surgical) exceeds the total in the first batch. Further, there is significant ambiguity regarding the timeline – Xiaoshan's donation is reported on as if it hasn't arrived yet after the donation is said to have arrived in Chinese official sources. The National Chamber of Deputies draft resolution speaks about a plane sent to China on April 17, 2020 in the past tense, but the donation from Xiaoshan in the future (it 'will arrive'). On the other hand, the donation portion attributed to Xiaoshan reportedly includes thermometers, which are not included in reports about Hangzhou's donation, but are in Xiaoshan's. For the time being, AidData assumes that, at the very least, all surgical masks from the first batch of supplies were donated by either the Xiaoshan District in Hangzhou, or the Hangzhou Municipality as a whole. However, this issue warrants further investigation.2. It is assumed that the 1754 suits that are considered part of this donation are the suits referenced by the phrase '件隔离服', which is translated as 'isolation suits'. This is distinct from the articles donated by ICBC Argentina (see project #93425), which are called '件隔离服' in another Chinese-language source, and is listed as a separate type of medical supply in the original Chinese Embassy source published on March 18. The suits in the donation from Xiaoshan are assumed to be 件隔离服 given that ICBC Argentina donated 3,500 suits, and 1754 + 3500 would exceed the total number of 套防护服 donated (5000). It is also possible that Xiaoshan donated a mixture of 件隔离服 and 件隔离服 suits, or did not make this donation at all and is included in the Hangzhou numbers. This issue warrants further investigation.3. AidData has estimated the transaction amount for this donation based on price catalogues from the World Health Organization (WHO). Please see the TUFF Methodology for additional details.4. Xiaoshan is a district of Hangzhou and contains the town of Louta.5.

The materials granted by each donor arrived on different dates. However, the date on which the materials granted by CCCC Argentina were handed over is unknown. AidData estimates that CCCC Argentina's contribution was worth about USD 6285.36, or, in terms of supplies, about 3,200 N95 masks, 394 isolation suits, 3,700 pairs of gloves, and 90 thermometers.  Part of CCCC's contribution may have gone to the Federal Police of Argentina in addition to Argentina's Ministry of Health (see Project ID#93975)","1. It is assumed that the materials were received by the Argentine Ministry of Health, insofar as there is direct evidence that the vast majority of the other portions of the same donation were handed over to the Ministry of Health.2. This project is linked to #91387, which itself links to the contributions of all other donors that contributed to the first batch of supplies committed on March 17, 2020.3. For the donors that are listed as contributors to this first batch of materials but provided an unknown number of supplies, AidData has applied the equal contribution assumption. The amount that can be directly attributed to a particular donor has been subtracted out from the total, and the value of the remaining supplies has been divided equally between the remaining donors.  Five total donors had an unknown contribution: Louta Town Government (#93424), China Communications Group Argentina (#93457), Sinopharm (#91463), Goldwind Technology Argentina (less than 50% Chinese state ownership, no project created), and Argentina-China Trade & Investment Promotion Association (includes an unknown mix of private/state-owned enterprises, AidData does not currently track these types of organizations as projects). Therefore, the value of the unaccounted for supplies has been divided by five.5. Although the majority of the donation is said to have been provided by the Hangzhou Municipal Government, the Xiaoshan District Government, and the Louta Town Government, there is no non-arbitrary mechanism to decide how to increase the estimated contribution for Louta Town. Thus, the equal contribution assumption has still been applied for consistency. However, this does indicate that the number of supplies donated by China Communications Group in this project may be inflated to some extent, as will the estimates listed for Sinopharm, Goldwind Technology Argentina, and Argentina-China Trade & Investment Promotion Association.6. The calculations for the portion of the donation provided by CCCC Argentina are as follows:   5,000 sets of protective clothing - 3,500 donated by ICBC Argentina (#93425) - 1,500 donated by Bank of China Buenos Aires (# 93427) = 0 sets of protective clothing66,000 N95 masks - 50,000 N95 masks donated by Hangzhou Municipal Government (#93423) = 16,000 N95 masks130,000 medical masks - 60,000 donated by Xiaoshan District Government (#93456) - 105,000 donated by Hangzhou Municipal Government (#93423) = -35,000 surgical masks. While this issue warrants further investigation, all other surgical mask donations are set to zero for the time being.2,000 goggles - 2,000 goggles donated by Hangzhou Municipal Government (#93423) = 0 goggles5,000 isolation suits - 1754 donated by Xiaoshan District Government (#93456) - 1275 donated by COFCO Argentina (#93455) = 1,971 isolation suits20,000 pairs of gloves - 1,500 donated by Xiaoshan District Government (#93456) = 18,500 pairs of gloves2,500 testing reagents - 1000 donated by the Mammoth Foundation - 500 donated by the Chinese Embassy (#69295) - 1000 donated by Hangzhou Municipal Government (#93423) = 0 testing reagents550 hand-held thermometers - 100 donated by Xiaoshan District Government (#93456) = 450 thermometers3 sets of thermal imaging equipment - 3 donated by Huawei (#93422) = 0 sets of thermal imaging equipmentIn total, 16,000 N95 masks, 1,971 isolation suits, 18,500 gloves, and 450 thermometers are unaccounted for. AidData estimates these remaining supplies are worth USD 31,426.80 based on price catalogues from the World Health Organization (Please see the TUFF Methodology for additional details). This total has been divided by the number of donors whose contributions are unknown (five) under the assumption that each made an equal contribution. Thus, the value of the CCCC Argentina's estimated contribution is USD 6285.36. ($31,426.80 / 5 = 6285.36)","# Sector
