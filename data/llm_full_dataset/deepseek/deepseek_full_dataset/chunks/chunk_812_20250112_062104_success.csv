55487,ACTION RELATING TO DEBT,Chinese Government cancels Rs 450 million of Government of Mauritius' outstanding debt obligations,"In November 2016, China agreed to write off a 450 million Rs debt to Mauritius to help continue positive relations between the countries. This decision came after the 10th Sino-Mauritius Joint Economic Commission was held in Beijing.","The loans forgiven through this action were almost certainly interest-free loans committed through previous ETCAs. As such, the loans likely had maturity lengths of 20 years and since they had reached maturity no later than 2016, they were almost certainly contracted prior to 2000. Therefore, AidData has not assigned this record to the umbrella category (as there is little risk of double counting the monetary value of the debts that were forgiven).","# Sector
