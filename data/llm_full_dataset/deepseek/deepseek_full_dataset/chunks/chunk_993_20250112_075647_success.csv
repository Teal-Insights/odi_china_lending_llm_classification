The Ethiopian the House of Representatives ratified the PBC agreement under Proclamation no. 854/2014 on June 24, 2014. The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 2% interest rate, a 6 year grace period, and a maturity of 20 years.   The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance 85% of the cost of a $216,530,065.53 (ETB 3,986,318,506.35) commercial (EPC) contract between the Ethiopian Roads Authority (ERA) and China Geo-engineering Construction Overseas Company Group (CGCOC), which was signed on March 5, 2013. The ERA was responsible for directly funding 15% (ETB 597,947,775.95 or $32,479,509.829) of the commercial contract cost.   According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the ETB 3,824,329,330 China Eximbank loan achieved a 92% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 13 loan disbursements (worth ETB 3,504,749,269) between 2014 and 2019: an ETB 1,127,312,414 disbursement on December 5, 2014, an ETB 134,979,543 disbursement on September 22, 2015, an ETB 232,092,985 disbursement on January 27, 2016, an ETB 278,697,350 disbursement on March 22, 2016, an ETB 201,034,192 disbursement on June 28, 2016, an ETB 243,047,849 disbursement on November 17, 2016, an ETB 41,534,408 disbursement on February 9, 2017, an ETB 51,830,494 disbursement on May 10, 2017, an ETB 321,959,701 disbursement on June 20, 2017, an ETB 271,887,740 disbursement on September 25, 2017, an ETB 100,050,872 disbursement on February 1, 2018, an ETB 86,890,755 disbursement on April 27, 2018, and an ETB 413,430,966 disbursement on November 28, 2019.  The purpose of the project was to construct a 220 km toll road from Dire Dawa (Diredawa) to Dewalle (Dawale). The road was constructed according to the following standard: 7 meters wide and 5 cm thick single layer of asphalt concrete, with 2 by 1.5m at the highway shoulder. CGCOC was the general EPC contract responsible for project implementation. Shandong Great Supervision and Consultation Co., Ltd. provided the consulting services for the project. The project commenced in October 2014. It was completed in December 2018. The road was officially inaugurated on June 18, 2019.   Upon completion, the toll road was officially transferred to the Ethiopian Toll Roads Enterprises. The completion of the project has reportedly reduced the travel time from Dire Dawa city to the Djibouti border from 10 hours to 4 hours. However, according to an October 2021 report, '[t]hus far, there is not much traffic on the road, which leads through the desert and has almost no services or other urban settlements along it. This highway could become financially viable by providing a faster link between Addis Ababa and Djibouti, but only when the missing sections between AdamaAwash-Mieso-Dire Dawa are built. While the AfDB and the WB are preparing financing for some of these missing sections, Chinese financing of the Dire Dawa-Dewele section was premature.’ To access the toll road, truck drivers are required to pay ETB 200 ($7); mid-size trucks are required to pay ETB 150; and automobile drivers are required to pay ETB 100. As of late 2021, there was no data available on the amount of toll revenue generated by the road.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Dire Dawa-Dewalle Toll Road Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs.

69476,ENERGY,CET provides $74.81 million supplier's credit for Power Supply System for Addis Ababa Light Rail Transit (AA-LRT) Project (Linked to Project ID#1471 and ID#69479),"On September 1, 2014, the Chinese Government and the Ethiopian Railways Corporation (ERC) — an Ethiopian state-owned enterprise — signed an agreement that provided a $74.81 million seller's credit for the Power Supply System for Addis Ababa Light Rail Transit (AA-LRT) Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance an $85 million commercial contract between ERC and China Electric Power Equipment and Technology Co., Ltd. (CET), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC).   The Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP) does not record any disbursements through this loan agreement.   The purpose of the project was to provide smooth and reliable power supply to the Addis Ababa Light Rail Transit (AA-LRT). The project involved the construction of GIS substations in the Kality, Ayat, Menelik Square, Egziabher-Ab Church, and Torhayloch areas of Addis Ababa. Of these, three are 132/15kVGIS substations and one is a 230/15kVGIS substation. The project also included the construction of three supporting facilities. The project reached completion on June 7, 2015.   The Addis Ababa light rail metro system has faced an array of operational performance and revenue generation problems. It initially began operating with 40 trains, but as of 2021, it was regularly operating with approximately 20 trains. Addis Ababa’s deputy mayor has also noted that the city’s electrical grid lacked the capacity to power the system before construction began. Even with its own dedicated power supply, the Addis Ababa light rail metro system still experiences power outages and delays, leading to packed cars and poor service. Additionally, in 2021, Ethiopia’s Office of the Auditor General found that, during its first four years in operation, the Addis Ababa light rail metro system generated $11.1 million of revenue but cost $154 million to operate. It found that the system was falling far short of its original feasibility study, which said it would pay for its construction costs within 10 years through ticket sales, advertising and renting out spaces in stations, among other methods: “[t]he feasibility study has been inadequate, and it was conducted without collecting enough information. […] This, coupled with the absence of a maintenance center to fix the trains that need repair and other factors, have contributed to the losses sustained by the light railway.”   Ethiopia’s Office of the Auditor General also found that the ERC had fallen into arrears and paid $2.8 million in fines to China Eximbank for overdue loan repayments.","1. This project is also known as the Addis Ababa Light Rail way transport power 2x15 KV air insulator switch gear line construction project and the Addis Ababa Light Rail GIS Substations Project. The Chinese project title is 埃塞俄比亚首都轻轨配套输变电工程 or 埃塞轻轨配套输变电项目. 2. The system identification number for this project in the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP) is 87143436112185. 3. There is not explicit evidence linking the loan as entered into Ethiopia's AMP, which records an ETB 1,572,763,419 loan for the Power Supply System for AA-LRT (but does not specify the lender) and the loan as entered into the Government of Ethiopia's Annual Public Sector Debt Portfolio, which records a $74.81 million loan from CET (but does not specify the project it is for). However, there is sufficient evidence for AidData to believe these are the same transaction. First, the commitment dates line up: the Debt Portfolio lists the loan as contracted during Fiscal Year 2014-2015 and AMP lists September 1, 2014. Second, no other financier for the AMP loan can be identified. Third, the loan recorded in the debt portfolio is very likely seller's credit. The substation project was also funded by seller's credit, per the China Electric Power International Capacity Cooperative Enterprise Alliance (中国电力国际产能合作企业联盟).Lastly, the transaction amounts are sufficiently similar that any difference can be attributed to differences which exchange rate is used to report the loan value, inflation, and rounding error. That is, the exchange rate used by AMP to report the loan's value in ETB may not be the same as the exchange rate when the loan was originally contracted, or similar issues vis a vis differences in the time the loan values were reported. As of September 2014, 1 Ethiopian Birr (ETB) was equal to 0.049 United States Dollars (USD), indicating the USD face value of the loan according to the AMP is an estimated $77,065,407.531. The value recorded in the debt portfolio is $74,810,000.4. The debt portfolio value, rather than the estimated USD value based on the AMP, has been recorded as the transaction amount, insofar as (1) it is in US dollars already, (2) is also from a government official source, and (3) is the more conservative value. 5. This China Eximbank loan is not included in the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020. Nor is it included in the China’s Overseas Development Finance Dataset that Boston University's Global Development Policy Center published in December 2020. 6. On June 22, 2011, China Eximbank and Ethiopian Railways Corporation (ERC) — an Ethiopian state-owned enterprise — signed a $475,000,000 (ETB 7,347,972,973) loan agreement for the Addis Ababa Light Rail Project.

The project involved the construction of GIS substations in the Kality, Ayat, Menelik Square, Egziabher-Ab Church, and Torhayloch areas of Addis Ababa. Of these, three are 132/15kVGIS substations and one is a 230/15kVGIS substation. The project also included the construction of three supporting facilities. The project reached completion on June 7, 2015.   The Addis Ababa light rail metro system has faced an array of operational performance and revenue generation problems. It initially began operating with 40 trains, but as of 2021, it was regularly operating with approximately 20 trains. Addis Ababa’s deputy mayor has also noted that the city’s electrical grid lacked the capacity to power the system before construction began. Even with its own dedicated power supply, the Addis Ababa light rail metro system still experiences power outages and delays, leading to packed cars and poor service. Additionally, in 2021, Ethiopia’s Office of the Auditor General found that, during its first four years in operation, the Addis Ababa light rail metro system generated $11.1 million of revenue but cost $154 million to operate. It found that the system was falling far short of its original feasibility study, which said it would pay for its construction costs within 10 years through ticket sales, advertising and renting out spaces in stations, among other methods: “[t]he feasibility study has been inadequate, and it was conducted without collecting enough information. […] This, coupled with the absence of a maintenance center to fix the trains that need repair and other factors, have contributed to the losses sustained by the light railway.”   Ethiopia’s Office of the Auditor General also found that the ERC had fallen into arrears and paid $2.8 million in fines to China Eximbank for overdue loan repayments.",TRUE,NA,GREY,HIGH,Grid Infrastructure,"Project focuses on power supply infrastructure for a light rail system, which supports public transportation but is not directly renewable energy",Construction of GIS substations and supporting facilities for light rail power supply

The Ethiopian Government issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus as 3% margin, a 14 year maturity, and 4 year grace period. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance a $647 million commercial (EPC) contract between ESC and China CAMC Engineering Co., Ltd.

The purpose of the project is to construct a sugar mill, construct a 135.5 meter-high and 840 meter-wide ‘May-Day’ irrigation dam on the Zarema River (next to the Waldiba Monastery) with the capacity to hold 3.5 billion cubic meters of water, install irrigation equipment, and construct a 4x30MW biogas power station (cogeneration power plant). About 70% of the electricity generated from the biogas power station (also known as the bagasse-fired power plant) will be used to run the sugar mill and 30% will connect to the surrounding area through a 137 kV electricity transmission line. The sugar mill (plant) will use sugarcane planted on 40,000 hectares of land and get irrigation water from the Tekeze, Kalema and Zarema rivers. Once it is fully operational, the sugar mill is expected to crush 24,000 tons of sugarcane per day (tcd), produce 484,000 tons of sugar per year, and produce 41.654 million liters of ethanol per year. The project site is located in Tigray Regional State’s Western Zone in Welkayit District.   CAMCE is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, Sur Construction is a subcontractor responsible for undertaking the construction of the irrigation dam. The project is being implemented in two phases (stages) and financed via two different loan tranches. On April 10, 2014, CAMCE signed a project design contract. Then, on October 9, 2016, a project commencement ceremony took place. Then, on March 15, 2019, Abraham Tekster, the Deputy Governor of Tigray, conducted an on-site project inspection. The project was originally expected to reach completion within 36 months (October 9, 2019). However, as of December 17, 2019, the Government of Ethiopia’s AMP noted that the ‘[irrigation] dam [was] not completed’ and the ‘field for sugar cane [was] not fully ready [for] production’. As of April 2020, the project had only achieved a 95% completion rate. On November 4, 2020, the Welkait Sugar Mill was damaged in an air raid during the Tigray conflict. The Chinese government ended up evacuating more than 600 of its citizens, including 187 employees from the Welkait Sugar Mill.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Welkait Sugar Mill Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. in 2019, Ethiopia’s Ministry of Finance announced that it was seeking to privatize the Welkait Sugar Mill (as part of a broader effort to address the government’s debt sustainability problems and the ESC’s inability to fund the ongoing operations of multiple, faltering sugar factories). Also, according to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs.
