56119,COMMUNICATIONS,China Eximbank provides RMB 249 million government concessional loan for National Broadband Expansion Project (Linked to Project ID#56033),"On September 22, 2018, the Chinese Government and the Government of Guyana signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the National Broadband Expansion Project. Then, on October 26, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Guyana signed an RMB 249,043,600 ($37.6 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2018) 26 TOTAL NO. (668)] for the National Broadband Expansion Project. The GCL carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 5-year grace period, a 20-year maturity period, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% (RMB 622,609) management fee. The proceeds of the GCL are to be used by the borrower to finance a $37.6 million commercial (EPC) contract (ID# OY03281700000E) between the Ministry of Communications of Guyana and Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd, which was signed on November 6, 2017. As of December 31, 2020, the loan had achieved a 95.7% disbursement rate ($35,991,584 out of $37,600,000) and its total amount outstanding (including principal and capitalized interest) was RMB 243,549,000.   The purpose of the project is to expand and upgrade the country’s existing e-government network in order to improve the efficacy of government services in four areas: (1) smart government solutions, (2) safe city solutions, (3) smart education, and (4) smart healthcare. The project also involves components that involved the construction of Long-term Evolution (LTE) towers, the equipping of a data center, the equipping of a unified emergency call center, the construction of a command center for the police keep track of patrol cars, an expansion of Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) monitoring, and training and human resource capacity building activities. The stated purpose of the “safe city"" component of the project is to enable the Guyana Police Force to track license plates and other documents, improve response times, and access critical information in real time. Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd and Guyana’s National Data Management Authority are responsible for project implementation. The project commenced in November 2019. As of late 2019, the Safe City component of the project was ‘largely complete’. By December 31, 2020, the China Eximbank loan had achieved an 95.7% disbursement rate ($35,991,584.40 out of $37,600,000).   This project has provoked local scrutiny and controversy due to the use of facial recognition technology in the smart city component and the possibility that Huawei would gain access to the Government of Guyana’s data systems. In November 2020, the Prime Minister of Guyana said that security concerns by the public had been heard and that measures would be put in place to guard against breaches, but he did not explain how this would be accomplished.",1.

56236,EDUCATION,Chinese Government provides $10 million grant — via ETCA — for Bertram Collins College Headquarters Construction Project,"On September 22, 2018, the Chinese Government and the Government of Guyana signed an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA), which committed RMB 100 million ($14 million) of grant funding for multiple projects. China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) reportedly allocated $10 million of grant funding from the ETCA for the Bertram Collins College Headquarters Construction Project.   The purpose of the project is to construct a modern, state-of-the-art facility — with a lecture room, canteen, gym, and study areas — on a 29-acre parcel of land in Ogle, East Coast Demerara — where the Guyana Sugar Corporation (GuySuCo) was once headquartered. As of August 26, 2020, the Chinese Government had already dispatched engineers, surveyors and other experts to the project site to conduct soil-testing and evaluate the viability of the project site. However, construction had not yet commenced. Then, in February 2021, the Irfaan Ali administration decided to close the Bertram Collins College of the Public Service. Vice President, Dr. Bharrat Jagdeo, said during a press conference that the David Granger Coalition Government had been using the College to run its political campaign with taxpayer dollars. The Vice President was responding to concerns that the decision to close the school was motivated by ethno-political bias. He noted that the People’s Progressive Party Civic (PPP/C) had held long ago that it would dismantle the school: ‘We campaigned on that. It’s not a secret,’ Dr. Jagdeo said. ‘As Leader of the Opposition, I said that. I said we’d save the money… and put it into other things that are more useful for people. We didn’t hide that before.’","1. This project is also known as the Bertram Collins College of the Public Service Construction Project and the Public Service College Project. 2. The Bertram Collins College of the Public Service is the brain-child of President David Granger following years of criticism of the public service for poor customer service. The college does not only provide training for current public servants, but also caters to school-leavers who are interested in pursuing a career there.","# Sector
