The borrowing terms of the two loans are unknown. However, it is known that the CFA 52,795,025,919 loan was backed by a Sinosure credit insurance policy. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the CFA 52,795,025,919 loan to finance 87% of the cost of a commercial contract between China Harbour Engineering Co., Ltd.
