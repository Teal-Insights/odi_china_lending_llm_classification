# Description
According to an online database of development projects (‘Carte des Projets de Développement au Maroc’) maintained by the Budget Directorate of the Government of Morocco’s Ministry of Economy and Finance, the Chinese Government committed MAD 41.4 million of grant funding for the Western High Atlas Geochemical Mapping Project in 2015. China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) was the source of funding. This project involved the creation of 4 geochemical maps for Morocco’s Western High Atlas region (la région du Haut Atlas occidental). The ultimate aim of the project was to facilitate the continued sale of Moroccan phosphate fertilizers to China and explore Morocco’s subsoil for other mining resources. Since 1958, Morocco has sold phosphate fertilizers to Sinochem, the leading producer and distributor of fertilizers in China.   China Geological Survey (Service géologique de Chine) — a government-owned, not-for-profit, Chinese organization — was responsible for the implementation of this project. Project implementation took place between July 2015 and February 2016. This project passed a final MOFCOM inspection in April 2016. However, according to the Government of Morocco’s Ministry of Finance, the Chinese Government had only disbursed MAD 14,821,200 of grant funding in support of this project as of March 28, 2018.",TRUE,NA,GREY,HIGH,Mining (Other),"Project focuses on geochemical mapping for mining exploration, primarily for phosphate fertilizers and other unspecified resources","Creation of geochemical maps, aim to explore Morocco's subsoil for mining resources, connection to phosphate fertilizer trade"
