58740,ENERGY,ICBC provides $80 million loan for 83 MW Athi River Medium Speed Diesel (MSD) Power Plant,"On October 16, 2013, Standard Bank and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) signed a $108 million syndicated loan agreement with Triumph Power Generating Company (TPGC or ‘Triumph’) — special purpose vehicle — for the 83MW Athi River Medium Speed Diesel (MSD) Power Plant Project in Kenya. ICBC provided $80 million of debt financing, and the Standard Bank of South Africa (Stanbic) provided the remaining $28 million. The syndicated loan carries an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.361% in October 2013) plus 803 basis points, a 1.5 year grace period, and a 15 year maturity.   The project was implemented on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis. As such, the loan was provided to a project company rather than the Government of Kenya.  Triumph Power Generating Company Ltd (TPGC) was established to undertake the design, financing, construction, and operation of the power plant on a build-own-operate (BOO) basis. The project was structured on a limited recourse basis and it reportedly finance according to a debt-equity ratio of 75:25. The power plant is located at Kitengela (near the Athi River) in Machakos County, about 25km from the Nairobi city in Kenya. The plant has a total installed capacity of 83MW and will consist of 10 x 9.0MW medium speed diesel (MSD) units.   XJ International Engineering Corporation — a wholly owned subsidiary of China State Grid Corporation — was the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contractor responsible for implementation.  As part of the project, Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC) signed a 20-year agreement with Triumph to purchase power from the plant, which was expected to be a crucial supplier to the utility during times of drought when the country's hydroelectric generating capacity becomes constrained. The foundation excavation work for the project began on April 23, 2012, and the power plant has been in commercial operation since February 2, 2016.   The World Bank's Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) agreed to provide $102.5 million in breach of contract insurance should Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC) fail to honor its 20-year power purchase agreement with Triumph. MIGA's insurance also covers the Government of Kenya's obligations under the Government of Kenya (GoK) Letter of Support. According to Kwame Parker, East Africa Head of Debt Solutions & Infrastructure Finance at CfC Stanbic Bank, '[t]he highlight of this transaction is that it marks the first time that a Chinese commercial bank has used MIGA cover for a non-recourse transaction' and '[i]t's also likely the first time a Chinese financial institution is directly lending to a project company for a transaction in Sub-Saharan Africa that is not related to resource extraction, with no explicit sovereign guarantee.'","1.

XJ International Engineering Corporation is part of the XJ Group of China which is one of China‘s largest manufacturers of power equipment and transmission and distribution technologies for the electric utility market and is owned by the State Grid Corporation which provides power to approximately 88% of China. 4. This loan is omitted from the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020. 5. Given that multiple sources refer to the transaction as a non-recourse project finance transaction and a debenture (which typically create a legal mortgage/charge that can be taken when a project company has an interest in property) and a charge over land, AidData has coded the loan as collateralized. 6. This no-recourse transaction is supported by a credit enhancement package for the project company, which includes a PRG Support Agreement and Project Agreement with KPLC, the Government of Kenya (GoK), and the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA) in relation to the issuance of an irrevocable on-demand letter of credit by JP Morgan to mitigate against any off-taker payment default as well as the related GoK political risk letter of support.

(2013) 38 TOTAL NO. (282)] for the Bishkek Thermal Power Plant Modernization Project. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, an 11 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.18% management fee. The proceeds from this loan were to be used to finance a $386,000,000 commercial contract (number D-166-21/322) between the Joint Stock Company (JSC) “Electric Power Plants of Kyrgyzstan” and Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock Co., Ltd. (TBEA).   According to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the first loan disbursement (of $115,800,000) took place on December 31, 2014. The same source notes that, as of 2014, the loan disbursement rate was 30% ($115,800,000 out of $386,000,000). According to internal data that the Kyrgyz Ministry of Finance shared with AidData in July 2022, this loan achieved a disbursement rate of 100% as of December 31, 2021 and its amount outstanding was $389,924,333.33 as of December 31, 2021.   The project sought to install two turbines (units 12 and 13) with a capacity of 150 megawatts at the Bishkek Thermal Power Plant (TPP). As a result, the capacity of Bishkek TPP was expected to increase by 125 megawatts. Prior to project completion, the annual output of electricity at the TPP was one billion kWh. After its modernization through the China Eximbank-financed project, the production of the TPP was expected to reach 1.8 billion kWh. Heat production was also expected to increase from two million gigacalories to three million gigacalories per year.   TBEA was the contractor responsible for implementation. Project implementation commenced on April 26, 2014 and the project was completed on August 30, 2017.   However, the Bishkek Therman Power Plant Modernization Project was plagued by controversy. Major failures occurred within 5 months of the power plant being put into operation.  Some boilers collapsed, causing power outages and stopping heating. In 2015, the Chamber of Audits, a state body tasked with overseeing government spending, issued a report questioning why the TBEA contract was not put out to tender when other companies were interested in bidding. Auditors also found that no technical feasibility study was undertaken to evaluate the needs and costs of the project. Nurlan Omurkul, who was chief of the Bishkek TPP, said that he had harbored strong doubts about hiring a company with no track record of building power stations, but that he had been badgered by senior Kyrgyz officials to endorse a decision that he said had obviously already been made. He told the New York Times that ‘I’ve worked my whole life in power and heating plants and knew all along that the Chinese price of $386 million was too expensive.’ Another Chinese company, China Machinery Engineering Corporation, offered a lower bid, $356 million, according to a parliamentary commission. But the Chinese Embassy reportedly insisted that its offer be dismissed. Eventually, the country’s former Prime Minister (Jantoro Satybaldiev), former mayor of Bishkek (Kubanychbek Kulmatov), and former Energy Minister (Osmonbek Artykbaev) were arrested on corruption charges and accused of using their positions to lobby for the interests of a Chinese company (TBEA) in the selection process of the contractor for the project.

The purpose of the project was to construct the Kazarman-Jalal Abad (km291-km433) section and Balykchy-Aral (km183+500-km195+486) section of the Alternative North-South Road. More specifically, it supported the construction of two road segments: one that runs from Kazarman village to Jalal Abad town (km291-km433) and another than runs from Balykchy (Kyzyl-Zhyldyz) village to Aral village (km183+500-195+486).  The ultimate aim of this international North-South transport corridor is to reduce trade costs and connect Russia, Central Asia, Iran, and India.   CRBC was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on May 2, 2014. The project was originally scheduled for completion in December 2018. However, as of December 2020, it had still only achieved a 70% completion rate. The project was ultimately completed on November 10, 2021.

China Eximbank provides $399.9 million preferential buyer’s credit for Kazarman-Jalal Abad Section and Balykchy-Aral Section of Alternative North-South Road Project (Linked to Project ID #46350 and #53585)

# Description
On September 11, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic's Ministry of Finance signed a $399,989,041 preferential buyer credit (PBC) loan agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC No (2013) 37 TOTAL No (281)] for the construction of the Kazarman-Jalal Abad Section (km291-km433) and Balykchy-Aral Section (km183+500-195+486) of the Alternative North-South Road Project. This project is also known as Phase 1 of the Alternative North-South Road Project (or “Строительство альтернативной автомобильной дороги Север-Юг, фаза 1”). The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, an 11 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.18% management fee, and a 0.25% commitment fee. The proceeds from the loan were used to support a July 8, 2013 commercial contract worth $399,989,041 between the Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic and China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC).   According to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the first loan disbursement (of $99,997,300) took place on December 31, 2014. The same source notes that the loan’s overall disbursement rate, as of 2014, was 25% ($99,997,300 out of $399,989,041). According to internal data that the Kyrgyz Ministry of Finance shared with AidData in July 2022, this loan achieved a disbursement rate of 75% ($299,991,780.75 of $399,989,041) as of December 31, 2021 and its amount outstanding was $303,058,363.40 as of December 31, 2021.  The purpose of the project was to construct the Kazarman-Jalal Abad (km291-km433) section and Balykchy-Aral (km183+500-km195+486) section of the Alternative North-South Road. More specifically, it supported the construction of two road segments: one that runs from Kazarman village to Jalal Abad town (km291-km433) and another than runs from Balykchy (Kyzyl-Zhyldyz) village to Aral village (km183+500-195+486).  The ultimate aim of this international North-South transport corridor is to reduce trade costs and connect Russia, Central Asia, Iran, and India.   CRBC was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on May 2, 2014. The project was originally scheduled for completion in December 2018. However, as of December 2020, it had still only achieved a 70% completion rate. The project was ultimately completed on November 10, 2021. It passed China Eximbank's final inspection in November 2022.  The are some indications that the preferential buyer's credit for the Kazarman-Jalal Abad Section and Balykchy-Aral Section of Alternative North-South Road Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic signed a debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE2-029]. Under the terms of the agreement (captured via Project ID#96102), the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 under the preferential buyer's credit agreement for the Kazarman-Jalal Abad Section and Balykchy-Aral Section of Alternative North-South Road Project.  The Alternative North-South Road Project has also been plagued by controversy and corruption allegations. According to a 2018 investigation, former Minister of Transport and Communications Kalykbek Sultanov and the Minister of Transport and Communications at the time (Zhamshitbek Kalilov) may have colluded with the contractor responsible for project implementation (CRBC) to embezzle funds that were allocated for the Alternative North-South Road by China Eximbank. The investigation found the project input costs were inflated by several orders of magnitude — from paying $1.1 per kilogram of cement (while the cost on the local market was $0.07) to paying $2,000 a month to provide office space to an engineer on the construction site.",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,General Infrastructure,Project focuses on road construction without clear environmental or energy transition impacts,"Construction of two road segments as part of international transport corridor, no renewable energy or fossil fuel components mentioned"
