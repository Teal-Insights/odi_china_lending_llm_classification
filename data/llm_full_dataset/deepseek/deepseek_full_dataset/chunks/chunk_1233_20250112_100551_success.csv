The loan agreement was backed by a separate Oil Sales and Purchase Contract between PetroEcuador and PetroChina. The agreement requires PetroEcuador to sell, over the entire validity period of the Facility Agreement, at least 72,000 barrels of crude oil per day and/or fuel oil to PetroChina. Petroecuador’s selling price to PetroChina was calculated based on the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil. The proceeds from the sale of oil were to be paid by PetroChina into a Proceeds Account, which was opened by PetroEcuador with CDB in China. Petroecuador was also required to maintain a minimum cash balance in the Proceeds Account, equivalent to 130% of the principal and interest due to be paid in that interest period.   The discretionary component (Tranche A) of the facility agreement funded projects including the Delsitanisagua Hydroelectric Power Plant (Project ID#58591), Quijos Hydroelectric Plant (Project ID#39060), Mazar Dudas Dam (Project ID#58593), the Villonaco Wind Farm (Project ID#39063), the Esmeraldas II Thermal Power Plant (Project ID#60794), and the ECU-911 Project (Project ID#39281).

It also paid a $4.6 million prepayment fee for Tranche A. No prepayment fee was required for Tranche B. The Government of Ecuador’s decision to repay the loan ahead of schedule reduced pressure on the public treasury by $91.63 million in December 2018, $90.05 million in March 2019, and $90.05 million in June 2019.

From 2010 to 2016, the Government of Ecuador entered into four separate loan agreements with China Development Bank totaling $7 billion which are related to a multi-party contractual structure that involves crude oil delivery contracts entered into with PetroChina and Unipec. Deliveries under these contracts are based upon international spot prices, such as WTI plus or minus a spread, plus a premium paid due to the term of the contracts. The spread is calculated using Argus, a crude oil price assessment publication (“Argus”) and the quality of crude oil as measured by the American Petroleum Institute.
