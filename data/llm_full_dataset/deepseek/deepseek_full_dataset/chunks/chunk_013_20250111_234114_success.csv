66345,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides EUR 189.4 million loan for 159.9 MW Dabar Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project,"On July 28, 2011, the Government of the Republic of Srpska granted a concession to HE DABAR d.o.o. Trebinje (also known as Hidroelektrana na Trebišnjici and HET) — a project company and special purpose vehicle — for the construction and operation of the 159MW Dabar Hydroelectric Power Plant. Then, in July 2013, China Eximbank signaled its willingness to provide a buyer’s credit loan to finance 85% of the cost of the commercial contract (85% x EUR 179.9 million = EUR 152.9 million) for this project. The expected borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: 3% interest rate, 15-year maturity, and 4-year grace period.   Then, on December 7, 2015, the Republic of Srpska and China International Water & Electric Corporation (CWE) signed an MOU regarding the 159MW Dabar Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. However, this agreement did not result in the signing of an EPC contract. Almost five years later, on May 4, 2020, Energy China Gezhouba Group and HPP Dabar L.L.C. — a wholly owned subsidiary of HET — signed an ‘EPC + F’ contract (worth approximately EUR 222,834,120 or RMB 1.7 billion) for the 159MW Dabar Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. Then, on December 31, 2021, Hidroelektrana Dabar (HPP Dabar) — a special purpose vehicle that is owned by HET — signed an 189,409,002 loan agreement with China Eximbank for the 159.9 MW Dabar Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: a 20-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, and interest rate of EURIBOR plus a 2.3% margin, a 0.5% commitment fee, a 0.5% management fee, and a Sinosure insurance fee of 6.42% of the value of the sum of loan's principal and interest (EUR 15,649,101.14). The loan was collateralized. However, as additional credit enhancements, the Republic of Srpska issued a government repayment guarantee and the borrower purchased a 20-year credit insurance policy from Sinosure. The proceeds of the loan are to be used by the borrower to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a EUR 222.8 million commercial contract that Hidroelektrana Dabar (HPP Dabar)  and China Gezhouba Group Company Limited signed on May 4, 2020.   The purpose of the project is to construct the 159.9 MW Dabar Hydroelectric Power Plant located in the city of Trebinje within the Republic of Srpska. The power plant, which will be part of the planned Gornji Horizonti hydropower complex, is expected to generate 250 GW per year upon completion. In January 2022, the state-owned power utility Elektroprivreda Republike Srpske (ERS) announced plans for a EUR 218 million capital increase in its subsidiary Hidroelektrane na Trebišnjici (HET) in order to raise money for the construction of the 159.9 MW Dabar Hydroelectric Power Plant. However, ERS insisted that the capital injection would not result in a takeover of HET.","1. Milbank LLP advised the lender.

66450,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides a EUR 300 million loan for First Section of Banja Luka-Prijedor-Novi Grad Motorway Project (Linked to Project ID#66452),"In December 2018, SDHS-CSI BH d.o.o.Banja Luka (SDHS-CSI BH) — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of China Shandong International Economic and Technical Cooperation Group (CSI) — signed a concession agreement with the Government of the Republic of Srpska for the First Section of the Banja Luka-Prijedor-Novi Grad Motorway Project. Under the terms of this agreement, SDHS-CSI BH is responsible for designing, financing, building, managing and maintaining a 42 km motorway section that runs from Banja Luka to Prijedor. The motorway will have two lanes in both directions, a traffic island, and an emergency lane.   According to the project design, the highway section will consist of seven tunnels and 35 bridges, three interchanges and the infrastructure for a closed system of the toll payment as well as the system for traffic safety management and control. This project represents the first highway concession project ever undertaken in the Republic of Srpska. The concession agreement lasts for 33 years, including a 3 year construction period. The EUR 297 million project is being implemented on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis and financed according to an unknown debt-to-equity ratio.   During the period in which it operates the motorway, the concessionaire (SDHS-CSI BH) will pay an annual fee of EUR 32.5 million to the Government of the Republic of Srpska. China Eximbank signaled its willingness to finance the project in 2018, and the project was originally expected to reach financial close (FC) during the summer of 2020. However, FC was not achieved according to the original timetable due to unexpected delays. The project’s groundbreaking ceremony ultimately took place on November 6, 2021.","1.

More research is needed to be undertaken to identify the precise face value of the China Eximbank loan commitment for this project. For the time being, AidData assumes (conservatively) that the EUR 297 million project is being financing according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30, which implies that the face value of the China Eximbank loan is EUR 207.9 million. Meanwhile, 'China’s focus means Bosnian economy no longer feeling left behind' published in May 2019 before financial close, suggests that the loan had a face value of EUR 300 million. This issue warrants further investigation. 3. The loan commitment date is another key piece of information that still needs to be identified.","# Sector
