(as captured via Project ID#1240). The BCL, which was finalized after the Government of Portugal failed to fulfill its 2010 commitment to finance the bridge, carried the following borrowing terms: a maturity of 20 years, a grace period of 5 years, and an interest rate of 4%.   The Government of Mozambique agreed to collect toll revenue to repay the loan. Then, on May 30, 2012, the Government of Mozambique ratified another buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement with China Eximbank worth $72,580,000 to provide supplemental funding for the Maputo-Katembe Bridge Construction Project. (captured via Project ID#57131). The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower purchased buyer’s credit insurance from Sinosure in support of the loan.  The Maputo-Katembe Bridge Construction Project involved the construction of a 3 kilometer long and 48 meter high suspension bridge that connects the cities of Maputo and Katembe. It also involved the extension of 129 kilometer road from Katembe to the border town of Ponta do Ouro, and the upgrading of ta 63 kilometer road between Boane and Bela Vista (including bridges over the Maputo, Futi and Umbelúzi rivers).   China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) and the Maputo Development Corporation (Maputo-Sul) were the entities responsible for implementation. An official groundbreaking ceremony took place on September 20, 2012.  However, construction did not begin in earnest until June 6, 2014 and the project encountered several major problems and delays. Maputo-Sul and CRBC employed more than 3,800 local workers and 500 Chinese workers. However, local workers organized protests in 2014 due to poor working conditions and late payments of salaries. The construction of the bridge also required the resettlement of 900 families and stallholders from the Nwankakakana market. Initially, insufficient compensation was offered to the concerned parties; however, extra funds were eventually allocated for building houses for the families and remunerating stallholders. The project was originally scheduled for completion on June 25, 2018 but it was ultimately completed on November 10, 2018.

This loan agreement was then ratified by the Government of Mozambique’s Council of Ministers on February 28, 2012. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown.   The Maputo Ring Road Project involved the construction and upgrading of six road sections over 74 kilometers. These road sections include: (1) 6.325 km expansion of Avenida da Marginal from Hotel Radisson to Costa do Sol; (2) 19.869 km construction of road from Costa do Sol to Marracuene; (3) 10.506 km construction of road from Chiango to Zimpeto; (4) 15.5 km expansion of the national road N1 from Zimpeto to Marracuene; (5) 16.299 km construction of road from Zimpeto to Tchumene (including connection to N4); and the (6) 5.5 km construction of a road from the Machava node to Praça 16 de Junho (including connection to Avenida 24 de Julho).  In total, the project involved 52 kilometers of new road construction, 22 kilometers of road upgrading work, and the construction or rehabilitation of 6 bridges and 3 interchanges. It is a two-way four-lane highway with double asphalt concrete pavement and a design speed of 60–80 km per hour. It allows commuters to bypass the existing N1 and N4 road. It also includes tolls and sidewalks.   China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on March 7, 2012 and a foundation stone laying ceremony took place on September 20, 2012. The project was originally expected to take 2 and a half years to execute. Construction was expected to be completed no later than December 2014. However, the project encountered various delays and problems during implementation (including a strike by construction workers in 2014). The implementation of the project and its management were handed over to Maputo Development Corporation (Maputo-Sul), a public company, in December 2014. The project was ultimately completed on December 29, 2015.   Centro de Integridade Pública (CIP) and Chr.

CIP and CMI also claim that the quality of the Maputo Ring Road is poor and vulnerable to erosion along at least two-thirds of its length.  Tolls on the Maputo ring road, contested by Mozambican civil society organizations, were charged beginning on February 1, 2022.  At that time, Rede Viária de Moçambique (Revimo) -- the concession company created in September 2018 and made responsible for the Maputo-Katembe Bridge, the Maputo Ring Road and the EN6 (Beira-Machipanda) Road in December 2019 -- charged tolls for use of the Maputo Ring Road ranging from 40 meticais (55 euro cents) for light vehicles to 580 meticais (€8) for heavy vehicles, with discounts of up to 75% for public transport and 60% for frequent users. CIP claimed at the time that Mozambicans could refuse to pay the tolls, alleging 'unconstitutionality and illegalities.' Another Mozambican NGO, the Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD), challenged the role of (Revimo) and advocated the revocation of the Maputo Ring Road concession. CDD questioned the interests of the concession company, stating that people 'do not know its organizational structure and the circumstances in which it was created.'

57131,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provided Mozambique $72.5 million buyer's credit loan for Maputo-Katembe Bridge Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#1240),"On July 18, 2012, the Government of Mozambique ratified a $681,590,562.91 buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement with China Eximbank for the Maputo-Katembe Bridge Construction Project. (as captured via Project ID#1240). The BCL, which was finalized after the Government of Portugal failed to fulfill its 2010 commitment to finance the bridge, carried the following borrowing terms: a maturity of 20 years, a grace period of 5 years, and an interest rate of 4%.   The Government of Mozambique agreed to collect toll revenue to repay the loan. Then, on May 30, 2012, the Government of Mozambique ratified another buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement with China Eximbank worth $72,580,000 to provide supplemental funding for the Maputo-Katembe Bridge Construction Project (captured via Project ID#57131). The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower purchased buyer’s credit insurance from Sinosure in support of the loan.  The Maputo-Katembe Bridge Construction Project involved the construction of a 3 kilometer long and 48 meter high suspension bridge that connects the cities of Maputo and Katembe. It also involved the extension of 129 kilometer road from Katembe to the border town of Ponta do Ouro, and the upgrading of ta 63 kilometer road between Boane and Bela Vista (including bridges over the Maputo, Futi and Umbelúzi rivers).   China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) and the Maputo Development Corporation (Maputo-Sul) were the entities responsible for implementation. An official groundbreaking ceremony took place on September 20, 2012.  However, construction did not begin in earnest until June 6, 2014 and the project encountered several major problems and delays. Maputo-Sul and CRBC employed more than 3,800 local workers and 500 Chinese workers. However, local workers organized protests in 2014 due to poor working conditions and late payments of salaries. The construction of the bridge also required the resettlement of 900 families and stallholders from the Nwankakakana market. Initially, insufficient compensation was offered to the concerned parties; however, extra funds were eventually allocated for building houses for the families and remunerating stallholders. The project was originally scheduled for completion on June 25, 2018 but it was ultimately completed on November 10, 2018.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Maputo-Katembe Bridge Construction Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2016, several credit rating agencies downgraded the Government of Mozambique to 'selective default' or 'restricted default' status, and the World Bank and the IMF re-classified Mozambique's external debt as 'in distress.' In January 2017, the Government of Mozambique defaulted on a coupon payment for its dollar-denominated Eurobond. Then, in February 2018, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that the Government of Mozambique had accumulated $710 million in arrears to external creditors and had agreed to reschedule some bilateral debt service payments with the Chinese Government. Two months later, in April 2018, Stelia Neta, a National Director at the Ministry of Finance of Mozambique revealed that the Government of Mozambique’s outstanding debt obligations to the Chinese Government amounted to $2.02 billion and the Chinese Government had agreed to extend the grace periods (and first principal repayments) on these outstanding debt obligations without changing their final maturity dates or interest rates (as captured via Project ID#66283).","1.
