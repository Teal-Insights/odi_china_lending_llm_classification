Another feature of the deal is that it postponed the shipment and sale oil to CNPC, thereby giving Petroecuador the flexibility to sell more of its oil to other buyers at market prices.",TRUE,NA,GREEN,HIGH,Hydropower,"Primary purpose is the construction of a hydroelectric power plant, which is a renewable energy project","275MW Minas-San Francisco Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project, renewable energy focus"
94366,HEALTH,China Communications Construction provides anti-epidemic materials to National Police of Ecuador in April 2020 (Linked to Project ID#91375),"On April 16, 2020, the China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), China Communications Construction (CCCC), and the Chamber of Commerce of Chinese Companies in Ecuador provided a joint donation of medical supplies to the National Police of Ecuador and the Ministry of Government. The materials will be distributed to police officers throughout Ecuador for prevention and control of COVID-19.  CCCC and the Chamber of Commerce's portions of the donation are unknown. CRBC's contribution to the donation consisted of 100,800 masks, 5,200 gloves, 2,000 protective suits, and 3,024 protective goggles; it was valued at approximately USD 90,000 and captured via Project ID#91375.  A handover ceremony took place on April 16, 2020 at the Mariscal Sucre Airport in Quito. Authorities from the Chinese Embassy in Ecuador, representatives of the Chamber of Commerce of Chinese Companies, and General Sp. Patricio Pazmiño, the Vice Minister of the Interior, attended the ceremony. TW Logistic Group helped facilitate the handover of the donation.","1. The supplies described as CRBC's portion of the donation in the project description may be the contents of the overall donation, and thus include CCCC's portion. This possibility arises from the fact that many sources about this donation report as if CRBC is the only donor, when it is known - based on photographs of the handover ceremony - that CCCC contributed as well. However, the wording alone of the Chinese Embassy's Tweet and the article from Ecuador's National Police, while ambiguous, seem to indicate better that CRBC alone contributed the 90,000 USD in supplies.  2. TW Logistics may have, instead of facilitating the donation, been one of the donors. However, AidData assumes it is an implementing organization due to the lack of information about the company (that is, it cannot be verified to be a member of the Chinese Enterprises Chamber of Commerce) and the phrasing of the sign in which TW Logistics is mentioned (the company contributed to the handover of the donation of materials from...the Chamber of Commerce/'contribuye con la entrega de donación de materiales de...la Cámara de Comercio'). Further, if it is a member of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Ecuador, it cannot be confirmed to be a majority state-owned company, and therefore does not merit a project.3. A project has not been created for the Chinese Enterprise Chamber of Commerce in Ecuador's contribution. For the time being, AidData does not track donations from these kinds of organizations, insofar as it is unknown which companies in particular contributed, as well as whether or not those companies are majority state-owned.","# Sector

The two Tweets from the Ecuadorian Embassy in China about this donation disagree on the number of surgical masks donated. The post from April 23, 2020 lists 100 million masks, while the post from April 30, 2020 lists 70 million. The latter number has been listed in the description (and should be used for transaction amount estimates) on the basis that it is the amount given upon actual delivery to the Ecuadorian Embassy, and it is the more conservative number.2. It is assumed that the April 23, 2020 finalization ('concretamos') of the donation represents a commitment.3. Given the evidence that the materials were shipped to Ecuador on May 28th, it has been assumed that the project was completed. May 31st has been added as the estimated completion date; this is the date the article from Ecuador's Foreign Ministry that discusses the shipment of the donations was published, and there is no indication in the article that the materials arrived prior to the article's publication.AidData has estimated the transaction amount for this donation based on price catalogues from the World Health Organization (WHO).
