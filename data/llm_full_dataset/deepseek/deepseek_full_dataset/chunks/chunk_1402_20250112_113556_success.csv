Then, on September 8, 2009, China Eximbank and the Government of Malawi signed an RMB 630 million government concessional loan (GCL) loan agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2009 26) TOTAL NO. (227)] for the Malawi International Conference Centre and Business Hotel Project. The loan included the following borrowing terms: a maturity of 20 years (final maturity date: September 21, 2029), a grace period of 5 years (first repayment date: March 21, 2015), an interest rate of 2%, a default (penalty) interest rate of 0%, a management fee of 1%, and a commitment fee of 0.75%. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance a commercial contract [number SCG-CLL 001] between Shanghai Construction (Group) General Company and Malawi's Ministry of Transport, Public Works, and Housing, which was signed on December 19, 2008.   The loan's principal amount outstanding was RMB 336,000,000 as of June 2023. As of 2022, the borrower expected to make principal repayments each year worth RMB 42,000,000 until 2029.  The project supported the construction of the Bingu International Conference Centre, Presidential Hotel, and Presidential Villas in the capital city of Lilongwe. Construction activities included a 130-room business hotel, a 1,000-seat dining hall and 170,000-square meter presidential villas.

The key feature of the Extended DSSI is that the repayment period of the principal and interest payments falling due between 1st January 2021 to 30th June 2021 will be made in five years with one-year grace period. This entails that in 2021/22 FY, the suspended debt service will be within the grace period.’ Then, in November 2022, the World Bank and the IMF judged the Government of Malawi’s external debt and overall public debt to be ‘in distress’—a downgrade from the previous World Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA).
