55326,BUSINESS AND OTHER SERVICES,China Eximbank provides $170 million preferential buyer’s credit for the Sam Lord's Castle Hotel Reconstruction Project,"On November 25, 2015, the Government of Barbados’ Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs signed a $170 million (BBD 340,000,000) preferential buyer credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2015) 22 TOTAL NO. (365)] with China Eximbank for the Sam Lord's Castle Hotel Reconstruction Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC (loan) were as follows: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, an interest rate of 2.5%, a default (penalty) interest rate of 0%, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% ($425,000) management fee. The borrower was expected to make semi-annual repayments between January 21, 2022 and January 31, 2037. The borrower was also required under the terms of the loan agreement to deposit foreign currency in an escrow account that is accessible to the lender (China Eximbank).   The proceeds of the loan were on-lent from the Government of Barbados’ Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs to the Barbados Tourism Investment Inc. The ‘end-user’ (Barbados Tourism Investment Inc.) then used the loan proceeds to finance 85% of the total cost of a $200 million commercial contract that it signed with China National Complete Plant Import & Export Corporation (中成进出口股份有限公司巴巴多斯分公司 or COMPLANT) on November 13, 2014.

The purpose of the project is to reconstruct the Wyndham Luxury resort at the Sam Lord's Castle in Saint Phillip's Parish (in Chinese: 山姆罗德酒店). The resort was expected to add 450 rooms to the island's room stock and to employ over 1,000 people.   China National Complete Plant Import & Export Corporation is the contractor responsible for project implementation.   A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on November 23, 2015. However, construction did not begin until June 2016. The project was originally expected to take three years to complete. However, project implementation ‘stalled’ in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic led to additional implementation delays in 2020. In July 2021, COMPLANT brought close to 200 Chinese workers to the project site.  However, local contractors expressed concern, pointing out that Barbadian companies were being pushed out in favor of the lower-wage Chinese laborers.

On June 1, 2018, the Government of Barbados announced a selective default and requested IMF balance of payments support. The timing of the announcement was partly driven by large external debt payments that were due in early June 2018, and the Government of Barbados defaulted on these partly with the aim of preserving foreign exchange reserves. However, the Government of Barbados honored its repayment obligations to China Eximbank under the PBC for the Sam Lord's Castle Hotel Reconstruction Project. As of 2020, Government of Barbados was unable to meet its $30 million counterpart funding contribution to the $200 million project and actively seeking to sell the hotel asset (upon completion of its construction).

89455,BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES,NBRB makes RMB 1 billion drawdown under currency swap agreement with PBOC in 2015,"On March 11, 2009, the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus (NBRB) and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) signed an RMB 20 billion (BYR 8 trillion), bilateral currency swap agreement to facilitate trade and improve foreign currency liquidity in Belarus. The agreement was extended for an additional three years in May 2015 and the value of the currency swap was reduced to RMB 7 billion. Then, on May 10, 2018, the agreement was extended for an additional three years. NBRB made a (gross) drawdown under the currency swap agreement equivalent to approximately RMB 1 billon in September 2015.  The maturity length and interest rate that applied to this borrowing is unknown.","1. A bilateral currency swap (BCS) agreement — also known as a central bank liquidity swap agreement — is an agreement between the central banks of two countries to exchange cash flows in different currencies at predetermined rates over a specified period of time. Central banks participate in these agreements to facilitate bilateral trade settlements using their national currencies (rather than relying upon on a third-party currency such as the U.S. dollar), manage demands from their local banks, and provide liquidity support to financial markets. The party that draws down on the swap line becomes the borrower and the other party becomes lender. During the term of the swap, the party that draws down on the swap line makes either fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amount. If both parties draw down on the swap line, then both parties exchange fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amounts.  The 5-step process of drawing upon a currency swap line with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) can described from the perspective of an importer in a given country (‘Country X’) seeking to settle trade with a Chinese firm in RMB. Step 1: The central bank of Country X and the PBOC activate their currency swap in advance, at which point each party deposits a specific amount of its currency in an account controlled by the other party (i.e. the central bank of Country X deposits local currency in an account controlled by the PBOC, and the PBOC deposits an equivalent amount in RMB in an account controlled by the central bank of Country X). Step 2: A firm in Country X that imports goods from China applies for an RMB-denominated loan from a domestic bank. Step 3: The domestic bank in Country X that receives the loan application then applies to its central bank for an RMB-denominated loan. After a review process, the central bank of Country X notifies the domestic bank applicant that its loan application was approved. The central bank of Country X subsequently requests that the PBOC transfer RMB funds from the central bank of Country X’s swap account within the PBOC to the loan applicant’s account with a corresponding bank in China. Step 4:  The domestic bank in Country X directs the corresponding bank in China to transfer RMB funds into a Chinese exporter’s account, and the corresponding bank in China provides RMB funds to the Chinese exporter. Step 5: The importer in Country X repays the RMB-denominated loan at its maturity date. The domestic bank notifies the central bank of Country X of the repayment, and transfers RMB into the central bank’s account within the PBOC through the corresponding bank in China. For the central bank of Country X, the RMB deposit is an asset that should be recorded on its balance sheet as an official reserve asset denominated in RMB. The contra entry of this asset is the liability in the local currency of Country X that represents China’s claims in the central bank of Country X. This should be also recorded on the balance sheet of the central bank of Country X. At the time of the exchange of currencies, it should be recorded as an increase in assets and an increase in liabilities of the monetary authorities in the balance of payments. The reason why the PBOC uses this mechanism to provide renminbi liquidity to other central bank is to increase the speed, convenience, and volume of transactions between the two countries. More detailed information about currency swaps with the PBOC can be found at https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021210-print-pdf.ashx and https://thechinaguys.com/the-rise-of-the-renminbi-the-reality-of-bilateral-swap-agreements/ and https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2017/pdf/17-25a.pdf. 2. AidData treats drawdowns under BCS agreements with the PBOC as collateralized loans because, in a BCS arrangement, the currency of the borrower is held as collateral while the lender receives interest on the amount drawn down by the borrower until repayment is made.3. Most central banks publish their end-of-year outstanding PBOC swap debt, but only a few report detailed transaction-level data on drawdowns during the year. Therefore, if no information on drawings is available, AidData assumes that total drawdowns during the reporting period equal the amount outstanding at the end of the reporting period (and vice versa). Since the (de jure) maturities of PBOC swap drawings are 12 months or less, this creates a lower bound estimate for actual drawdowns under the PBOC swap line. 4. PBOC swap debt is frequently rolled over. In central bank reports where one can only observe the year-end outstanding amount, no distinction between rollovers and drawdowns is possible. In these cases, one can derive (new) drawdowns as the difference between the current and last year’s outstanding swap debt stock. This measure essentially captures net lending through the PBOC swap line.","# Sector
