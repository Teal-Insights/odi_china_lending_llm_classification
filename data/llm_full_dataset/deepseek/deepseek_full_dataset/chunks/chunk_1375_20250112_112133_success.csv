98173,ENERGY,ICBC provides $140 million equity bridge loan to BPC for 600MW Morupule B Power Plant Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#40),"On June 15, 2009, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and Botswana Power Corporation (BPC) — a state-owned power company in Botswana — signed a $825,048,559.40 export credit facility agreement for the 600MW Morupule B Power Plant Construction Project. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 3.5-year grace period, and an annual interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 1.6% margin. The borrower was expected to repay the loan between December 2012 to June 2029. It was also expected to use the loan proceeds to finance 85% of the cost of a $970 million commercial (EPC) contract with China National Electric Equipment Corporation (CNEEC), which was signed in November 2008.  Sinosure and the World Bank insured the buyer's credit loan (export credit facility) and the Government of Botswana’s Ministry of Finance also provided a sovereign guarantee. As an additional credit enhancement, the borrower agreed to maintain a minimum cash balance of $33 million (equivalent to one principal and interest repayment/installment) in a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA). The Government of Republic of Botswana funded the DSRA with P300 million while Botswana Power Corporation paid the balance of P48 million.  The total cost of the Morupule B Power Project was $1.6623 billion. It was financed according to a 70:30 debt-to-equity ratio. ICBC contributed $825 million of debt financing, while the World Bank, and the African Development Bank contributed $136.4 million and $202.5 million of debt financing, respectively. The 30% equity contribution ($498.4 million) came from Botswana Power Corporation and the Government of Botswana.  In addition to the long-term (20-year) export credit facility, ICBC provided a short-term $140 million equity bridge loan to the project sponsor (BPC) to ensure that it could meet its equity contribution requirement. The borrowing terms that applied to the equity bridge loan are unknown. However, it is known that the loan was guaranteed by Standard Bank.  Standard Bank also provided 20-year currency and interest rate hedging for the export credit facility – a cross-currency swap designed to convert US dollar funding into fixed rate synthetic Botswana Pula, thus minimizing BPC's exposure to adverse movements in foreign exchange and interest rates, and enabling the sponsor to align loan currency with the currency of its revenue stream for the full repayment period.  The project involved the construction of a 600MW coal-fired power plant consisting of 4x150MW units — that uses circulating fluidized bed technology — for domestic power generation purposes. The 600MW Morupule B power plant is located in the township of Palapye, northeast of Gaborone, and it is geographically adjacent to the existing 132MW Morupule A power plant. It sources feedstock from the same mine as the existing 132MW Morupule A plant. The project has three main components: the Morupule B Power Station; a 400kV Morupule B–Phokoje transmission system and associated sub-stations linking the plant to the BPC grid; and a 35-borehole well-field and associated water reticulation system. The coal is sourced from the Morupule coal mine, which is the only major operating coal mine in Botswana. The Morupule coal mine is operated by Morupule Colliery Limited, a subsidiary of Debswana Diamond Company.  China National Electric Equipment Corporation (CNEEC) was the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Shenyang Blower Works (Group) Co., Ltd (SBW) also supported the project as a subcontractor. Site and contractor’s camp accommodation facilities as well as bush clearing activities started in early June 2009 and were effectively completed by the end of July 2009, which facilitated CNEEC-SBW to undertake Topographical Survey and Geotechnical Investigation to confirm the design parameters associated with the in-situ ground geological data at the site area. The erection of the contractor’s camp facilities started in November 2009. The camp had the capacity to accommodate approximately 1,500 staff. The project's official EPC contract commencement date was April 29, 2009. However, the project's groundbreaking ceremony did not take place until February 19, 2010. It was originally envisaged that the power plant would become operational by October 2012. However, the project experienced significant delays and CNEEC did not hand over the four power generation units to the BPC until May 4, 2014. Then, in October 2014, three of the four power generation units broke down, and the Government of Botswana had needed to consider importing energy from South Africa. The power plant was originally expected to operate at the annual capacity factor of about 80 percent, with annual gross generation of about 4,200 gigawatt-hour (GWh). However, the plant’s capacity factor was closer to 50 percent, reflecting poor availability and unreliability of the units due to forced outages. Units 1-4 had the capacity to produce 600MW, but they only operated at 21 percent capacity producing only 130MW. According to BPC's 2019 Annual Report, BPC signed a Defects Remediation Agreement with CNEEC to remedy the plant's defects, which was expected to result in the remediation of all plant defects in a phased manner between 2019 and January 2023.  Efforts were also undertaken to expand the plant’s power generation capacity to 900MW after a tender for construction of two additional units (Unit 5 and 6) was awarded to a joint venture between Japanese Marubeni and South Korea’s Posco Energy.",NA,"# Sector

38420,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",[Drawn down amount] China Development Bank provides $10 billion line of credit for oil exploration in the Santos Basin (Linked to Project ID#36737),"On November 3, 2009, the China Development Bank (CDB) issued a $10 billion line of credit to Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.(Petrobras) for the exploration of the Santos Basin pre-salt oil fields (captured in Project ID#36737).  All borrowings under the line of credit carried the following terms: a 10-year maturity and an annual interest rate of LIBOR + a 2.8% margin (6-month USD LIBOR + 2.8 = 0.517+2.8=3.317%).   As a source of collateral, Petrobras signed a ten-year oil-supply contract with Sinopec’s (subsidiary) trading company, UNIPEC Asia, and agreed to provide 150,000 barrels per day in the first year (2009) and 200,000 barrels per day for the following nine years (2010-2019). Sinopec agreed to pay market prices for Petrobras’ oil and deposit payments for the oil in Petrobras’ CDB account, and the borrower (Petrobras) agreed to maintain a minimum account balance equivalent to six months of interest payments.   As of December 31, 2009, $3 billion of the $10 billion credit line had been utilized (i.e. drawn down) by the borrower. Then, on February 10, 2010, Petrobras withdrew an additional $2 billion from the credit line.  The borrower ultimately drew down $7 billion in total from the credit line (as captured via Project ID#38420).   It was originally envisaged that $3 billion from the credit line would be utilized to purchase Chinese equipment. However, Petrobras ultimately decided not to do so. The loan proceeds were to be used by the borrower for oil exploration activities in the Santos Basin, which was part of a larger effort to upgrade the refinery capabilities of Petrobras.  Sinopec — a Chinese state-owned oil company — and Petrobras were jointly responsible for implementing the project. In January 2018, Petrobras pre-paid the residual balance of the oil supply contract, effectively ending its oil sales commitment to Sinopec.","1. Most of China’s oil-backed loan agreements involve a bank, an oil company, and a trading firm. An oil company in the borrower country must sell a certain number of barrels during a specific period, and payments for the oil are sent directly to the bank. Therefore, the borrower uses the proceeds of oil sales to meet its loan repayment obligations.2. One source (https://www.ipea.gov.br/revistas/index.php/rtm/article/download/258/257) suggests that Petrobras contracted an additional $3 billion CDB loan with a 10-year maturity in 2014. However, AidData has not yet independently corroborated the existence of such a loan.  This issue requires further investigation. More research is also needed to determine if the 2014 loan served as a ‘replacement’ for the $3 billion that Petrobras chose not to utilize under the $10 billion line of credit from 2009. 3.

The loan restructured an existing credit agreement that was signed on October 25, 2007, which CDB also contributed to, captured via project ID#92461. The new loan carried an 11 year maturity and an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3.38% margin.  The participants in the loan syndicate included Itau-Unibanco, Caterpillar Financial Services, UniCredit, WestLB, Standard Chartered Bank, BBVA, Shinhan Bank, Nordkap Bank, Nomura, MUFG Bank, Mizuho Financial Group, Intesa Sanpaolo, KfW Development Bank, CIC Bank, Dexia Group, HSH Nordbank, International Finance Corporation, and China Development Bank (CDB). Mizuho, Standard Chartered, Unicredit/HVB, and WestLB were the lead arrangers. The precise contribution of CDB to the 2009 loan is unknown. Further, some sources indicate that multiple Chinese financial institutions contributed to the syndicate, not just CDB.  The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to refinance a previous loan for the construction of two semi submersible drilling platforms known as Schahin I and Schahin III. The refinancing was necessary due to delays in project implementation. The rigs (drilling platforms) were to be built by Singapore’s Yantai Raffles Shipyard Company, with whom two EPC contracts were signed, at its facilities in China. EPC contract terms included performance guarantees issued by Sinosure for 10% of the contract values, liquidated damages equal to 5% of the contract values, and, according to some sources, retention payments equivalent to 15% of the contract values.   Petrobras was expected to use the drilling platforms in the Campos Basin offshore Brazil. Schahin I was to be operated under a seven-year contract with Petrobras starting in 2010 and was designed to operate at depths up to 2,000m, with a drilling depth of 7,500 meters below the seabed. The contract was won in a Brazilian-only bid. The Schahin III rig received a five year contract after a bidding process open to international firms. It was designed to operate at a depth of 2,400 meters, respectively, also with a drilling depth of 7,500 meters below the seabed. Construction for both rigs was originally expected to take 3.5 years, though it is unknown to what extent this estimate was affected by the implementation delays that resulted in the project's refinancing.   While the exact start and end dates of the rigs' construction are unknown, the project was completed, and the rights to the two drilling platforms were sold to ICBC in 2014 through a sale-leaseback transaction in order to repay this loan.    Then, on July 13, 2021, a lawsuit was filed against a total of twelve banks (involved in one or both of the syndicates) by several subsidiaries of the Schahin Group. The lawsuit claimed that the banks had collaborated 'with the CEO and CFO of two Schahin Group entities [to sell] the oil rigs to ICBC below fair value when the Schahin Group was in financial distress.'","1. This syndicated loan may include other Chinese financiers. The list of 18 banks that contributed to the loan is taken from 'Black Gold Two Semi-Submersible Drilling Platforms Refinancing' only includes a contribution from CDB. However, other reports, such as 'Schahin Drilling: Yantai surprise', indicate multiple Chinese financial institutions were involved in financing. Further, reporting on the original 2007 loan also refers to multiple Chinese banks being involved, including naming China Construction Bank, but a breakdown of individual bank contributions again only includes CDB. Lastly, the lawsuit against twelve of the banks involved in one or both of the loans includes both Bank of China and China Development Bank as respondents. These issues warrant further investigation. 2. AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate by adding 3.38% to average 6-month LIBOR in December 2008 (2.178%). 3. AidData has coded the loan as collateralized because it is referred to as a ‘secured’ loan.4.

Schahin I was to be operated under a seven-year contract with Petrobras starting in 2010 and was designed to operate at depths up to 2,000m, with a drilling depth of 7,500 meters below the seabed. The contract was won in a Brazilian-only bid. The Schahin III rig received a five year contract after a bidding process open to international firms. It was designed to operate at a depth of 2,400 meters, respectively, also with a drilling depth of 7,500 meters below the seabed. Construction for both rigs was originally expected to take 3.5 years, though it is unknown to what extent this estimate was affected by the implementation delays that resulted in the project's refinancing.   While the exact start and end dates of the rigs' construction are unknown, the project was completed, and the rights to the two drilling platforms were sold to ICBC in 2014 through a sale-leaseback transaction in order to repay this loan.    Then, on July 13, 2021, a lawsuit was filed against a total of twelve banks (involved in one or both of the syndicates) by several subsidiaries of the Schahin Group. The lawsuit claimed that the banks had collaborated 'with the CEO and CFO of two Schahin Group entities [to sell] the oil rigs to ICBC below fair value when the Schahin Group was in financial distress.'",TRUE,NA,BROWN,HIGH,Oil and Gas Infrastructure,"Project involves financing for oil drilling platforms, directly supporting fossil fuel extraction","Semi-submersible drilling platforms for offshore oil extraction in Campos Basin, contracts with Petrobras for oil drilling operations"
