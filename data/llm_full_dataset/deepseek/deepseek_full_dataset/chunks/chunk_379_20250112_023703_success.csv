91766,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides loan worth approximately $479 million to KazAutoZhol for unspecified road project,"On or around April 25, 2019, JSC KazAutoZhol National Company Joint Stock Company (JSC NC KazAutoZhol or азАвтоЖол)— a Kazakh state-owned transportation company — and the Export-Import Bank of China signed a loan agreement for an unspecified road project. The estimated face value of the loan is $479,020,691. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. The proceeds of the loan will likely be used by the borrower to finance (a) a commercial contract (with an unknown monetary value) for the 144 km Podstepnoe-Fedorovka-Russian Border (A30) National Expressway Upgrade Project that was signed by CITIC Construction Co. Ltd and KazAutoZhol on June 27, 2019; and/or (b) a commercial contract worth approximately 92 billion tenge ($211,363,928) for the Kabanbay Batyr Avenue Reconstruction Project that was signed by a Kazakh-Chinese consortium (consisting of China Xinxing Construction and Development Co. Ltd and JV Sine Midas Stroy LLP) and KazAutoZhol on May 14, 2020. However, the question of how the loan proceeds are being used requires further investigation.","1. Evidence that China Eximbank and KazAutoZhol signed a loan agreement in April 2019 is provided by the following sources: https://www.financialnews.com.cn/yh/shd/201904/t20190429_159106_5.html and https://language.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201904/28/WS5cc50ab7a3104842260b8d8e.html and http://www.beltandroadforum.org/english/n100/2019/0427/c36-1312.html. 2.

In its 2018 financial statements, JSC NC KazAutoZhol disclosed that it signed 5 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreements with China Eximbank in 2017 and 2018 worth $2,394,789,000 to support 5 road reconstruction projects: a $434.5 million PBC for the Kalbatau–Maikapshagai Road Reconstruction Project (captured via Project ID#54990), a $796 million PBC for the Taldy-Korgan-Kalbatau-Ust-Kamenogorsk Road Reconstruction Project (captured via Project ID#55016), a $253.3 million PBC for the Merke-Burylbaital Highway Reconstruction Project (captured via Project ID#54989), a $183.95 million PBC for the Astana Bypass Road Reconstruction Project (captured via Project ID#54991), and a $727.2 million PBC for the 326.6 km Karaganda-Balkhash Highway Reconstruction Project (captured via Project ID#53554). The combined monetary value of these 5 PBC is $2,394,962,309, which is very close to $2,394,789,000 figure reported in the 2018 financial statements of JSC NC KazAutoZhol (https://www.dropbox.com/s/5d5y0hhe1xy9wuu/KazAvtoZhol_2018_FS_ENG.pdf?dl=0). Then, in its 2019 financial statements (https://www.dropbox.com/s/6goifhh40v6gwt5/FS%20KazAvtoZhol%202019%20RUS.pdf?dl=0), JSC NC KazAutoZhol disclosed that as of January 2020 it had borrowed $2,873,983,000 from China Eximbank for various road projects. Therefore, to estimate the face value of the China Eximbank loan that was issued to KazAutoZhol in April 2019, AidData subtracted $2,394,962,309 from $2,873,983,000. 4. This China Eximbank loan is not included in the China’s Overseas Development Finance Dataset that Boston University's Global Development Policy Center published in December 2020. 5. It is likely that the April 2019 loan was issued in the form of a preferential buyer’s credit (since all previous China Eximbank loans to KazA8toZhol were provided as preferential buyer’s credits). However, AidData has not yet independently confirmed that the loan was issued as a preferential buyer’s credit. This issue warrants further investigation.","# Sector

Two months later, in November 2018, CRBC undertook a project feasibility study. It then completed a technical proposal in January 2019 and a financial proposal in March 2019. Then, in April 2019, the Kenyan Government awarded a contract to CRBC for the Nairobi JKIA–James Gichuru Expressway Project. A project agreement was signed on June 30, 2019. Then, on October 15, 2019, CRBC and Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) signed a a 30-year concession agreement. The total cost of the Nairobi JKIA–James Gichuru Expressway Project is RMB 4.602 billion ($668 million).   It is being implemented on a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) and Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25. On September 8, 2019, Moja Expressway Company Limited — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of CRBC — signed a loan agreement worth approximately $501 million with an unspecified Chinese bank. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 3-year grace period, and a 7% interest rate.   China Road and Bridge Engineering Co., Ltd. (中国路桥工程有限) and CCCC International (Hong Kong) Holdings Limited (中交国际(香港)控股有限) also agreed to make equity contributions of $133.6 million and $33.4 million, respectively, to Moja Expressway Company Limited in order to support the implementation of project. The Nairobi JKIA–James Gichuru Expressway Project involves the development, operation and maintenance of an expressway between Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) and James Gichuru Road. The 27.1 km expressway, with 18.2 km on the ground and 8.9 km elevated, will run from JKIA to James Gichuru road (Westlands Redhill Road Link). It will connect Mlolongo town in Machakos County with James Gichuru Road along the median strip of the A8 National Road. The 4-lane dual carriageway will have 11 interchanges at Mlolongo, Standard Gauge Railway, Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Eastern Bypass, Southern Bypass, Capital Centre, Haile Selassie Avenue, Museum Hill, Westlands, and James Gichuru Road. It will be built to a Class A standard with a design speed of 80 km/h.   CRBC is the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction commenced on May 4, 2019. However, a formal groundbreaking ceremony did not take place until October 16, 2019. As of July 2021 the project had achieved a 60% completion rate. By November 8, 2021, it had achieved a 75% completion rate. A main line beam erection ceremony was held on December 23, 2021 and attended by the Kenyan President, the Kenyan Minister of Transport, and the Chinese Ambassador to Kenya. By December 2021, the project had achieved a 94% completion rate. As of April 2022, it had achieved a 95% completion rate. During the construction phase, this project reportedly employed 4,000 workers. The expressway was originally scheduled to be opened to traffic on June 30, 2022. It was ultimately opened to traffic on May 14, 2022.   Under the terms of its 30-year concession (BOOT) agreement (with a 3 year construction period and 27 year operation period), CRBC is responsible for transferring the Nairobi JKIA–James Gichuru Expressway back to KENHA in 2049 and it is expected to repay its loan (and recoup its equity investment) by collecting toll revenues. Once operational, each driver on the expressway will be required to pay a toll of between 109.4 and 1,641 Kenyan shillings (between $1 and $15), depending on the size of the car and the distance traveled. Over the course of the 30-year concession period, the project is expected to generate $2.765 billion. The project has been disclosed as a contingent public sector liability by the Kenyan Treasury (due to the fact that early termination of the PPP contract with Moja Expressway Company Limited would require that the Government of Kenya make termination payments to Moja Expressway Company Limited).","1.
