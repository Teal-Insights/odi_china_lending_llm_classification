The purpose of this $2 billion loan facility was to finance large development projects in Africa between 2014 and 2024. The AGTF is sponsored by the PBOC and the administered by AfDB.  Then, on October 23, 2015, AGTF signed an $44,290,563 loan agreement [ID#5050130000102] with the Government of Tanzania for Phase II of the Dar es Salaam Bus Rapid Transit System Project. On the same day, the African Development Bank (AfDB) issued a $97,420,000 loan [ID#2000130014182] to the Government of Tanzania for the same project. The AGTF loan carried the following terms: 20 year maturity, 5 year grace period, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 0.6% margin. As of May 2019, AGTF has disbursed $1,373,632.00.  The loan proceeds were to be used to finance (1) a design contract [ID#DART/CO1/20115] between Tanzania National Roads Agency (TANROADS) and M/S BOTEK Bosphorus Technical Consulting Corporation of Turkey in Association with M/S Apex Engineering Co. Ltd of Tanzania (As sub-consultant), which was signed on February 25, 2017 and commenced on March 27, 2017; (2) a design and supervision contract [ID#TRD/HQ/1039/2016/17] between Tanzania National Roads Agency (TANROADS) and M/S Inter-Consult, which was signed on February 25, 2017 and commenced on March 24, 2017; (3) a (Lot 1) commercial contract [ID#AE/001/2017-18/DSM/W/98] between Tanzania National Roads Agency (TANROADS) and Sinohydro Corporation Ltd, which was signed on December 10, 2018 and commenced on May 6, 2019; (4) and a (Lot 2) commercial contract [ID#TRD/HQ/1009/2018/19] between Tanzania National Roads Agency (TANROADS) and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), which was signed on August 13, 2018 and commenced on March 1, 2019.  Phase 2 of the Dar es Salaam Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Project involves the construction of infrastructure that includes 20.3 km of exclusive BRT lanes and Non Motorised Transport (NMT) facilities along Kilwa Road corridor and part of Kawawa Road. The project corridor traverses from Mbagala Area in Temeke District to the Central Business District where it connects with Phase 1 of the BRT system at the Kariakoo hub. In addition to the construction of road infrastructure, the project involves the construction of 29 bus stations, one bus depot at Mbagala-Rangitatu and two bus terminals at Mbagala-Rangitatu and Kariakoo-Gerezani. Moreover, two flyovers; one at Nyerere Road/Chang’ombe Road junction and second at Nelson Mandela/Kilwa road junction are to be constructed. Non-Motorized Transport facilities and five feeder stations at Dar es Salaam University College of Education (DUCE), Mtoni Kwa Azizi Ali, Mbagala-Rangitatu, Zakhiem and Mtoni-Kijichi are also to be provided. A pedestrian overpass bridge will be constructed at Mbagala area. Alongside infrastructure development, feeders’ stations for Phase 2 are identified at Charambe and Kongowe, all being connected to Mbagala Rangitatu, Mtoni kwa Azizi Alli that connects North and South Tandika, Mtoni, Temeke and Buza while Kijichi Misheni connects Misheni, Kijichi and Mbagala Kuu. Another feeder route is the DUCE-Chang’ombe which connects Temeke, Kigamboni and Tandika area.  The project is expected to benefit an estimated population of at least 1.2 million representing some 25% of the Dar es Salaam City’s population. Other beneficiaries include users of major city connecting arterial roads including Mandela and Nyerere Roads. Key outcomes include improved accessibility to the larger populations of Dar es Salaam particularly Temeke Municipality, reduced travel time to public transport commuters, improved air quality to travelers and residents living close to the roadway, improved property values arising from reduced congestion, and improved business environment for traders arising from improved accessibility, new market facilities and improved sanitation. The disadvantaged women, school children, handicapped and elderly are also poised to benefit from the new BRT system. At the moment, they cannot manage to comfortably use the existing public transport especially during peak hours. Finally, employment will be created during both the construction phase and the operations phases of the proposed BRT line. The provision of BRT system is expected to directly enhance and improve the traffic circulation and eliminate bottlenecks to traffic flow to various economic activity centers such as the industrial zones, and the vast populous residential areas of Temeke Municipality. The project is therefore expected to impact positively on the informal and formal businesses by providing them with improved accessibility and enhanced roadside air quality. It is further estimated that by improving the existing road and public transport system, the annual vehicular GHG emission rates in tones would drop by at least 60% due to improved average traffic operating speeds along the project corridor and particularly by the use large modern buses that uses modern technology and cleaner fuels in the BRT system.  The originally expected project implementation start date was April 27, 2016 and the originally expected project completion date was December 31, 2020. The project ultimately commenced on March 1, 2019. It suffered significant delays in procurement due to lengthy design review process. As of September 2019, all land acquisition activities were completed and construction activities were underway.","1. The all-in interest rate (1.128%) was calculated by adding an 0.6% margin to the average 6-month LIBOR rate in October 2015 (0.528%).2.

The project is jointly financed by the Bank Group (61.1%), Africa Growing Together Fund (AGTF) (27.8%) and the Government of Tanzania (11.1%).5. The entire Phase 2 trunk system of 20.3 kilometers will be built along the middle of existing roads. A 9m wide median along Kilwa road is currently reserved for BRT lanes, terminals and stations. Throughout the entire corridor, there will be tree-shaded bicycle and pedestrian ways on both sides of the road. The average distance between bus stops will be 500 meters and system users will be encouraged to either walk or bicycle to the bus stops (privately operated bicycle parking facilities are planned at each bus stop). Ninety seven (97) articulated trunk buses with a capacity of 140 passengers will provide both normal (stopping at all stations) and express services (stopping only at connector stations). Additionally, a system of 105 feeder buses with a capacity of 60 passengers will transport passengers to the trunk system through feeder stations. Trunk buses will be accessed at the stations by the passengers at level which will enhance system capacity and comfort. The system is expected to operate for 18 hours from 5am to 11 pm. The bus fleet which will be under separate financing arrangement and operated by a Private Bus Operator and is expected to serve 495,000 passenger trips per day of which approximately 50% are women and 150 million trips annually.  The project involves the construction of BRT infrastructure along Kilwa Road from Mbagala to CBD (14.9 km), and Changombe Road to Kawawa Road (5.4 km) connecting to Phase 1 line at Magomeni area. The construction includes Terminals, Depots, Feeder Stations, NMT facilities and flyovers at Nyerere/Kawawa and Mandela/Kilwa roads intersection. The works on Kilwa road involve constructing two BRT lanes in the right of way provided in the center of existing mixed traffic lanes with service roads, bicycle lanes and pedestrian walkways.

Three years later, on December 22, 2014, BoT and the PBOC renewed their bilateral currency swap agreement and set the maximum drawing rights to RMB 70 billion (THB 370 billion). BoT and the PBOC renewed their bilateral currency swap agreement — with maximum drawing rights of RMB 70 billion (THB 370 billion) — again on December 22, 2017. BNM made three (gross) drawdowns under the currency swap agreement in 2013, 2015, and 2016: an RMB 500 million drawdown in 2013, an RMB 500,000,000 drawdown in 2015, and an RMB 500 million drawdown in 2016. The interest rate and maturity length that applied to these drawdowns (borrowings) are unknown. However, it is known that the proceeds from the drawdowns were used by BOT to make RMB liquidity available to financial institutions in Thailand in order to facilitate cross-border trade and investment settlements. The 2013 drawdown is captured via Project ID#92562; the 2015 drawdown is captured via Project ID#92560; and the 2016 drawdown is captured via Project ID#92561.","1. A bilateral currency swap (BCS) agreement — also known as a central bank liquidity swap agreement — is an agreement between the central banks of two countries to exchange cash flows in different currencies at predetermined rates over a specified period of time. Central banks participate in these agreements to facilitate bilateral trade settlements using their national currencies (rather than relying upon on a third-party currency such as the U.S. dollar), manage demands from their local banks, and provide liquidity support to financial markets. The party that draws down on the swap line becomes the borrower and the other party becomes lender. During the term of the swap, the party that draws down on the swap line makes either fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amount. If both parties draw down on the swap line, then both parties exchange fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amounts.  The 5-step process of drawing upon a currency swap line with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) can described from the perspective of an importer in a given country (‘Country X’) seeking to settle trade with a Chinese firm in RMB. Step 1: The central bank of Country X and the PBOC activate their currency swap in advance, at which point each party deposits a specific amount of its currency in an account controlled by the other party (i.e. the central bank of Country X deposits local currency in an account controlled by the PBOC, and the PBOC deposits an equivalent amount in RMB in an account controlled by the central bank of Country X). Step 2: A firm in Country X that imports goods from China applies for an RMB-denominated loan from a domestic bank. Step 3: The domestic bank in Country X that receives the loan application then applies to its central bank for an RMB-denominated loan. After a review process, the central bank of Country X notifies the domestic bank applicant that its loan application was approved. The central bank of Country X subsequently requests that the PBOC transfer RMB funds from the central bank of Country X’s swap account within the PBOC to the loan applicant’s account with a corresponding bank in China. Step 4:  The domestic bank in Country X directs the corresponding bank in China to transfer RMB funds into a Chinese exporter’s account, and the corresponding bank in China provides RMB funds to the Chinese exporter. Step 5: The importer in Country X repays the RMB-denominated loan at its maturity date. The domestic bank notifies the central bank of Country X of the repayment, and transfers RMB into the central bank’s account within the PBOC through the corresponding bank in China. For the central bank of Country X, the RMB deposit is an asset that should be recorded on its balance sheet as an official reserve asset denominated in RMB. The contra entry of this asset is the liability in the local currency of Country X that represents China’s claims in the central bank of Country X. This should be also recorded on the balance sheet of the central bank of Country X. At the time of the exchange of currencies, it should be recorded as an increase in assets and an increase in liabilities of the monetary authorities in the balance of payments. The reason why the PBOC uses this mechanism to provide renminbi liquidity to other central bank is to increase the speed, convenience, and volume of transactions between the two countries. More detailed information about currency swaps with the PBOC can be found at https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021210-print-pdf.ashx and https://thechinaguys.com/the-rise-of-the-renminbi-the-reality-of-bilateral-swap-agreements/ and https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2017/pdf/17-25a.pdf. 2. AidData treats drawdowns under BCS agreements with the PBOC as collateralized loans because, in a BCS arrangement, the currency of the borrower is held as collateral while the lender receives interest on the amount drawn down by the borrower until repayment is made. 3. BOT and and PBOC first signed a currency swap agreement on December 6, 2001. A series of renewal agreements ensued.4. Most central banks publish their end-of-year outstanding PBOC swap debt, but only a few report detailed transaction-level data on drawdowns during the year. Therefore, if no information on drawings is available, AidData assumes that total drawdowns during the reporting period equal the amount outstanding at the end of the reporting period (and vice versa). Since the (de jure) maturities of PBOC swap drawdowns are 12 months or less, this creates a lower bound estimate for actual drawdowns under the PBOC swap line.5. PBOC swap debt is frequently rolled over. In central bank reports where one can only observe the year-end outstanding amount, no distinction between rollovers and drawdowns is possible. In these cases, one can derive (new) drawdowns as the difference between the current and last year’s outstanding swap debt stock. This measure essentially captures net lending (drawdowns) through the PBOC swap line.","# Sector
