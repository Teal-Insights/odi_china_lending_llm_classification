An unspecified Chinese state-owned bank issued a loan worth RMB 4,440,000,000 to SINOCONST to facilitate the implementation of the project. The loan’s final maturity date is in 2028 (implied maturity length: 10 years). The other borrowing terms of the loan are unknown.

It is also known that the borrower expects to use the loan proceeds to partially finance the RMB 5 billion ($790 million) EPCF contract that was signed on March 7, 2018.   The purpose of the project is to construct a 250 km section of a 446 km railway that runs from Shiraz to Bushehr. The 250 km section includes 13 km of tunnels and 2,600 bridges. The project’s earthworks include 17 million cubic meters of excavation and 13 million cubic meters of embankment.   SINOCONST is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, Jahanpars Engineering and Construction Company — an Iranian subcontractor — is also involved in the implementation of the project.
