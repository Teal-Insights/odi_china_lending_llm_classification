92483,ENERGY,Bank of China participates in $781 million syndicated debt financing package for 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project (Linked to Project ID#62217 and #92481),"The Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant first emerged in a 1999 study of hydropower dam potential in the Nam Theun, Sekong, and Sesan River basins in Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). However, the ADB did not follow up on the project due to its marginal financial viability and its potentially serious environmental and social impacts, especially on migratory fish stocks and fishing livelihoods. Then, in June 2007, the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy (MIME) of Cambodia granted permission for Electricité du Viet Nam (EVN) to conduct a detailed feasibility study. The study was implemented by a consulting firm, Power Engineering Consulting Joint Stock Company 1 (PECC1), in collaboration and consultation with technical ministries/agencies of the Royal Government of Cambodia. Then, on November 26, 2012, The Government of Cambodia and Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and joint venture of the Royal Group of Cambodia (39%), Hydrolancang International Energy (51%), and Vietnam Electricity (EVN) (10%) — signed an implementation agreement (IA) for the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project. On the same day, Électricité du Cambodge (EDC) and Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Under these two agreements, Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. was granted a 45-year concession (40 years of operation and a construction period of 5 years) and it was specified that the electricity generated by Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. — through the Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant — would be sold to EDC at the fixed price of 6.95 US cents per kilowatt-hour. These agreements also specified that, after 40 years of operation, the ownership of the Lower Sesan II dam will be transferred to the Government of Cambodia. On December 12, 2012, the Government of Cambodia also agreed to guarantee the payment (power purchase) obligations of EDC and Cambodia’s Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy to Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd under the PPA and the IA.  The total cost of the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project, which was implemented on a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis, was $978 million and it was financed with a mix of debt and equity. In December 2013, China Development Bank (captured via Project ID#62217), ICBC (captured via Project ID#92481), and Bank of China (captured via Project ID#92483) provided a $781 million debt financing package (with a 17-year maturity and an interest rate of 6.5%) to Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. for the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project. The financing was structured in the 2 tranches: (i) an initial bridge financing with ICBC under a financial leasing structure (the first for an infrastructure project in Cambodia); and (ii) a subsequent project financing by China Development Bank and Bank of China. Sinosure provided credit insurance. The Government of Cambodia issued a sovereign guarantee in the event on non-payment by EDC.  The purpose of this project was to construct a hydroelectric power plant in the northeastern province of Stung Treng on the Se San River. Its locational coordinates are 13°32′59.5″N 106°15′49.4″E. The Lower Sesan II Dam is 80 meters tall and occupies a 36,000-hectare plot. The plant has eight turbines and each turbine has an installed capacity of 50 megawatts (400 MW total capacity). Upon completion, the plant was expected to produce 1.9 billion kilowatt-hours per year, boost electricity production in the country by 20%, and bring installed hydropower capacity to 1328MW.  PowerChina HuaDong Engineering Corporation Limited (HDEC) was the contractor responsible for project design. Sinohydro Bureau 8 Co., Ltd was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began in December 2013. The watergate was officially closed on September 25, 2017. The first turbine began producing electricity in November 2017. The dam was officially opened on December 18, 2018.   The Chinese banks that financed the project divided environmental and social risks control into specific segments, including pre-loan investigation, loan review, contract management, loan issuance and post-loan management. They also required an environmental impact assessment (EIA) after the completion of the project. CDB went even further by introducing a standard review procedure. Sinosure also required that the project developer pay special attention to social and environmental responsibilities -- in particular, by resolving controversies around the dam through public consultation. The project developer held several public consultations with the affected communities in line with the guidelines of the Chinese banks. In July 2015, as requested by the local staff members of the CDB, the project developer held a dialogue with 140 people representing communities affected by the 400MW Lower Sesan II hydropower plant, Cambodian government representatives at national and sub-national levels, and NGOs to discuss their concerns and other issues related to the project. The participants then paid a visit on July 27, 2014 to the resettlement site to inspect on the quality of the housing construction, agricultural land, and dam construction. During the visit, community representatives and media held an informal on-site dialogue and raised questions to the Ministry of Mine and Energy’s secretary of state, project development, and the Stung Treng Deputy Governor in charge of Resettlement and Compensation Committee.   Nevertheless, the project was affected by protests from thousands of villagers who were at risk of being displaced or losing their livelihoods. On February 13, 2014, villagers living in the dam reservoir lodged a petition to the Chinese embassy in Phnom Penh, relevant ministries of the Cambodian government, and the developer to discuss compensation and resettlement conditions in detail. On August 10, 2021, Human Rights Watch released a report about the various ways in which the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project allegedly harmed the lives and livelihoods of thousands of indigenous and ethnic minority people. The report claims that the construction of the Lower Sesan 2 dam displaced nearly 5,000 people without adequately providing compensation or livelihood assistance. It also notes that, although by community members occurred during the dam’s construction between 2011 and 2018, public officials ignored the complaints and moved forward with the construction project.","1.

289,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides $541.6 million buyer's credit loan for Phase 1 of 211MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project (Linked to Project ID#57586),"On January 21, 2013, China Eximbank and the Cameroonian Ministry of Economy, Planning, and Regional Development signed a buyer's credit loan (BCL) agreement (Contract No. BLACAM 2011001) worth $541,566,018 for Phase 1 of the 211 MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. The borrowing terms of the BCL are as follows: a 15-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3.10% margin, a 1% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.50% commitment fee, and a 0.50% management fee. The Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Cameroon agreed to provide the lender with a repayment guarantee (as defined in Article 1 of the BCL agreement). The borrower also purchased buyer's credit insurance from Sinosure. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the total cost ($637,136,492) of a commercial (EPC) contract between Cameroon’s Ministry of Water and Energy and Sinohydro Corporation, which was signed on April 12, 2012.   As of December 31, 2020, the loan (BCL) had achieved a 100% disbursement rate and the its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 203.4 billion.   The Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project is a large-scale hydro-electric run-of-river dam and hydroelectric generator plant that involves a barrage that is 1,260 meters long and 14 meters high, with two overflow channels and a grand spillway to the generating plant. The dam site is around 26 square kilometers. The plant has four generators and turbines each. It is expected to inject 211 MW of electricity into Cameroon's energy supply network. The plant is located in Nyabizan on the Ntem River in the South region, 300 km from Yaounde. Sinohydro Corporation was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. On June 15, 2012, President Paul Biya presided over the ceremony to lay the foundation stone of the project. Construction was completed in August 2016.   Project ID#57586 captures a separate China Eximbank loan worth $141.8 million loan for Phase 2 of the 211 MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. The proceeds of this loan were used by the borrower for the construction of 294 pylons between Nyabizan and Ebolowa to evacuate 211MW of power from the Memve'ele dam to Yaounde, the installation of 225 KV transmission lines, and the construction and installation of three transformer substations with a capacity of 225/90 KV in the localities of Ebolowa, Nkoumou in the South Region and Ahala in the Centre Region. As of September 30, 2021, the construction of the Nyabizan-Yaoundé evacuation line had achieved a 92% completion rate. However, the completion of Phase 2 depends on payment of compensation to the people affected by the transmission line’s corridor. According to the Government of Cameroon, the revenue generated by the power plant and Nyabizan-Yaoundé transmission line since ‘powering up’ from April 2019 to October 2021 amounts to CFAF 45 billion. In addition, the partial completion of the 211MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project has reportedly enabled the shutdown of the Ahala, Oyom-Abang, Mbalmayo and Ebolowa thermal power stations.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the 211MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.’","1.

It was supposed to take approximately 36 months (12 months for feasibility studies and 24 months for project execution) to complete. Phase 1 started October 1, 2013 and it was completed in August 2017.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the 9 Cities Water Supply Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.’","1.

The borrower agreed to deposit project-related revenues in a special account to facilitate repayment.   The proceeds of the China Eximbank loan were on-lent by Cameroon's Ministry of Water Resources and Energy to the Cameroon Water Utilities Corporation (Camwater) of the Republic of Cameroon to finance the commercial contract (worth RMB 1,653,018,595.78 and later amended to RMB 1.059 billion) with CGC Overseas Construction Group Co.
