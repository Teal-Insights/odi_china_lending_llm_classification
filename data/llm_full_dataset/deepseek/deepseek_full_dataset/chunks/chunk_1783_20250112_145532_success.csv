This crude oil donation project was supported via recurring grants from China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) between 2000 and 2017.2. Since 1991, China has been North Korea's largest crude oil provider, making up 80% of its supply. Crude oil is provided to North Korea through a pipeline (known as the Dandong-Sinuiju Pipeline or Friendship Oil Pipeline) from the Daqing Oil Field, 800 kilometers north of the China-North Korea border. The pipeline, which was completed in December 1975, runs for more than 30 km from storage facilities in the Chinese border city of Dandong to an oil depot in Sinuiju in North Korea. It supplies approximately 520,000 tons (3.64 million barrels) of heavy crude oil each year, according to its operator, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). Once across the border, the crude oil is processed at North Korea's sole working refinery, the Ponghwa Chemical Factory, a facility built with Chinese assistance during the 1970s. The refinery turns the oil into refined products for North Korea's government, military, transport, agricultural and fishing sectors.","# Sector

The proceeds of loan, which is captured via Project ID#382, were used to support the creation of joint venture between ZTE and the Congolese Office of Post Telecommunications (OCPT) in Kinshasa, called Congo-Chine Télécoms (CCT) or Congo-China Telecom S.A.R.L. (CCT) (Chinese name: 刚中电讯有限公司). ZTE held a 51% equity stake in the joint venture, and OCPT held a 49% equity stake. Most of the loan proceeds were used to be used by the borrower to acquire equipment from ZTE and thereby build CCT’s telecommunications network in the DRC. According to the Aid Management Platform (AMP) of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the loan achieved a 100% disbursement rate ($9,665,149.43 out of $9,664,765.67). CCT launched GSM-900/1800 services on December 31, 2001 in Katanga in the east of the country. It subsequently rolled out services to Kinshasa, Bas-Congo, Bandundu and the two provinces of Kasai, giving it coverage in 40 cities. The CCT network, at the time, had a capacity for 150,000 customers, with a single switch in Kinshasa, and it used a Belgacom earth station for its international gateway.   Then, on March 11, 2006, ZTE Corporation signed a sales contract and a service contract with Congo-Chine Télécoms (CCT) worth $123 million. On June 29, 2007, the China Development Bank (as arranger, initial lender and facility agent) signed the Phase I and Phase II loan facility agreements with CCT (as borrower). The aggregate loan amount was $105 million (covering Phase I with $63 million and Phase II with $42 million). The proceeds of the loan, which is captured via Project ID#60113, were to be used to finance CCT’s payments to ZTE Corporation worth 85% of the cost of the 2006 sales and service contract. The 2007 loan was guaranteed by the ZTE Corporation's 51% equity interest (see Project ID#383) in Congo-Chine Télécom (CCT). The Ministry of State-owned Enterprises of Congo (Kinshasa) provided a counter-guarantee by pledging its 25% equity interest in CCT. The loan was also secured with (i.e. collateralized against) fixed assets purchased by the borrower with the loan proceeds.   Then, on October 20, 2011, France Telecom-Orange (FT-Orange) acquired a 100% ownership stake in CCT  (the majority of which was assumed debt), buying the 51% ownership stake held by the ZTE Corporation and the 49% ownership stake held the Congolese State. Under the terms of a share purchase agreement signed with ZTE Corporation, FT-Orange agreed to pay $10 million (EUR 7 million) to the Chinese equipment manufacturer for its 51% stake in CCT. Under the terms of a share purchase agreement signed with the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo (after a call for tenders), FT-Orange agreed to pay $7 million (EUR 5 million) to the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo for its 49% stake in CCT.  CCT was renamed ‘Orange RDC’ and the Orange brand was introduced to the DRC on December 6, 2012.
