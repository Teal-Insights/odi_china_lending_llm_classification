The purpose of the project was to construct a Pacific Marine Industrial Zone (PMIZ) in Portions 1349 and 1350 of Vidar Plantation within Madang Province. The project involved the construction of a fish port (with a cannery/tuna processing plant) and refrigeration plant), a fuel farm, a container terminal, a power plant, water and wastewater facilities, and an export processing zone. Upon completion, the project was expected to encourage onshore processing of tuna resources and create economies of scale, which would reduce post harvest losses through the construction of an integrated modern port complex.   The Department of Commerce and Industry of the Government of Papua New Guinea claimed at the time that the country was losing $808 million a year because it did not process fish caught in its waters. At the design/appraisal stage, an economic evaluation of the project suggested that it would achieve an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) about the Government of Papua New Guinea’s 12% hurdle rate.   CSYIC was the contractor responsible for implementation. Project implementation was delayed for years due to legal, land ownership, and environmental issues and China Eximbank reportedly withheld disbursements until some of these issues were resolved. The project officially entered implementation on November 24, 2015. However, in 2017, the project scope was expanded to include a larger wharf and cover the costs of water, electricity, and telecommunication connections. PNG's Prime Minister Peter O'Neill announced in September 2017 that China Eximbank would fund the expanded project with a $150 million dollar loan. The project ultimately completed and handed over to the local authorities on January 31, 2019.   The project was plagued by controversy for three reasons. First, an audit of the Department of Commerce and Industry revealed that government officials had siphoned off ‘millions of kina’ from the PMIZ project through graft and corruption. Second, government officials ignored independent recommendations to site the project in Port Moresby or Lae, where firms could utilize existing infrastructure to operate at lower production costs. The International Finance Corporation declined to finance for the PMIZ when the Department of Commerce and Industry refused a project feasibility assessment and indicated that it would only consider locating the PMIZ in Madang Province (which infrastructure, transport, labour and communications networks). Third, Madang residents mobilized land claims to demand a greater share of benefits from tuna-based investments. Hundreds of coastal residents staged large protests and defaced PMIZ billboards – consistent with predictions of a ‘high potential of sabotage from those that will be detrimentally affected by the PMIZ’ included in the PMIZ feasibility study contracted by China Eximbank.   In May 2015, individuals living within the impact area of the PMIZ, apparently under the guidance of Ken Fairweather (a Member of Parliament for Sumkar), circulated a petition “Stop PMIZ – a ‘Fishy Deal’"". They demanded a response by May 25, 2015. The petition was presented to the Governor of Madang. Ken Fairweather assisted the villagers by presenting it on the floor of Parliament. This brought a reaction from Nixon Duban, the member for Madang proper, who objected in Parliament, ‘Our people have registered their umbrella companies, they are all organized, and I want to assure the Government that we want this project to go ahead.’   Within a week Duban had the support of Madang Governor, Jim Kas. The Prime Minister, Peter O’Neill, had already put out a press release, which said that ‘The Government is fully supportive of the PMIZ project continuing. There has been some misinformation, particularly in relation to land ownership, and this is unfortunate. The land where the PMIZ project is located was bought from RD Tuna Cannery for four million Kina and is State land, not customary land as some have claimed. . . . We are satisfied that the project will not cause pollution to the environment, especially the pristine water ways and islands of Madang. . . . In total the project will generate K2 billion every year in economic activity to our nation with most of this being around Madang Province.

# Description
On July 18, 2008, the Department of Commerce and Industry of the Government of Papua New Guinea and Shenyang International Economic and Technical Cooperation Company (CSYIC) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) regarding the Pacific Marine Industrial Zone (PMIZ) Project. Then, in November 2009, China Eximbank and the Government of Papua New Guinea signed a $95 million preferential loan framework agreement for Phase 1 of the Pacific Marine Industrial Zone (PMIZ) Project. On September 29, 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Papua New Guinea (represented by its Ministry of Treasury and Finance) signed an RMB 678,571,429 ($95 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for Phase 1 of the Pacific Marine Industrial Zone (PMIZ) Project. The GCL reportedly carried the following terms: 20-year maturity. 5-year grace period, 2% interest rate.

53087,ENERGY,China Development Bank provides $365 million loan for 209.3 MW San Gabán III Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#72868),"In late 2015, China Three Gorges Corporation and Energías de Portugal S.A. submitted a declaration of interest in the 209.3 MW San Gabán III Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project. Then, on March 22, 2016, Hydro Global Perú S.A.C. — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of China Three Gorges Corporation (50% equity stake) and Energías de Portugal S.A. (50% equity stake) — signed a 30-year concession agreement [Concession Definitiva de Generación Contract 494-2016] with Peru’s Ministry of Energy and Mines and PROINVERSION for the project. The $438 million independent power project (IPP) is being implemented on a build, operate, and transfer (BOT) basis and financed with an estimated debt-to-equity ratio of 87:13. On November 29, 2017, the Hebei Branch of China Development Bank signed a $365 million loan agreement with Hydro Global Perú S.A.C. for the 209.3 MW San Gabán III Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project. The loan, which is captured via Project ID#53087, reportedly carries a 19-year maturity. It is backed by an insurance policy (most likely from Sinosure) and a corporate repayment guarantee from China Three Gorges Corporation. It is collateralized against the cash deposits in bank accounts and equity stakes that China Three Gorges Corporation and Energías de Portugal S.A. hold in the project company (Hydro Global Perú S.A.C.). Its interest rate and grace period are unknown. The first loan disbursement (worth $95 million) took place on December 22, 2017. The equity contribution is captured via Project ID#72868.   The purpose of the project is to construct a 209.3 MW hydroelectric power plant — with two 104.6-megawatt impulse turbines — on the San Gabán River in San Gabán District, Carabaya Province, and Puno Department. The San Gabán III Hydroelectric Power Plant builds upon the San Gabán II Hydroelectric Power Plant, which is located upstream on the San Gabán River.  The project also involves the construction of a 220 kV, 139 km transmission line from the Paquillusi substation in Puno to the Onocora substation in Cusco, as well as a low-pressure tunnel, a vertical shaft, a high-pressure tunnel, a cavern power station, and a discharge tunnel that will return the turbine water to the river.   Upon completion, the power plant is expected to generate 1.255 billion kWh per year. At the end of the 30-year concession period, Hydro Global Perú S.A.C. will turn the power plant over to San Gabán Electrical Generation Company S.A. (Empresa de Generación Eléctrica San Gabán S.A.), which is a state-owned corporation that is wholly owned by Peru's National Fund for the Financing of the State Business Activity (Fondo Nacional de Financiamiento de la Actividad Empresarial del Estado/Fonafe). Sinohydro Bureau 6 Co. Ltd. — a subsidiary of Sinohydro Group Limited — is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Dessau S&Z S.A. carried out the project’s feasibility study.   Construction began on September 1, 2017 and the originally scheduled project completion date was February 1, 2022. However, the project encountered various implementation challenges and fell behind schedule. Hydro Global Perú S.A.C. sought permission from Peru’s Ministry of Energy and Mines to declare force majeure due to the Covid-19 pandemic. As of September 2020, the project had only achieved an 18% completion rate. Then, in August 2022, Hydro Global Perú S.A.C. filed a request with the environmental certification service for sustainable investments (Senace) to change the route of the transmission line so that it would connect to the already operational Azángaro Nueva (Pumiri) substation. At that time, the project had only achieved a 34% completion rate, Then, on September 5, 2022, construction of the earth-rock dam began.”","1. The Chinese project title is 席圣加旺水电站融 or 秘鲁圣加旺水电站项目.
