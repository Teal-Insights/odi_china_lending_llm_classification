According to a 2019 report published by the Republic of Congo’s National Assembly, all loans approved under the June 19, 2006 framework agreement had grace periods between 3 and 5 years.

The purpose of this project was to construction the Revolution Olilou-Gampo school complex, which is located in Ouenzé in the 5th district of Brazzaville. The complex includes two separate administrative blocks for the high school and the middle school. These blocks consist of an amphitheater with 364 seats; a library with an adjoining reading room; a multimedia center; a medical room; meeting rooms; multipurpose rooms; catering areas; 40 offices; three teachers' rooms; toilet blocks; twelve laboratory rooms equipped for languages, physics, chemistry and life and earth sciences; a 3000 seat modern gymnasium, a football field; roads; three electricity generators for the high school, college, and gymnasium; and a water well supplying four water tanks.
