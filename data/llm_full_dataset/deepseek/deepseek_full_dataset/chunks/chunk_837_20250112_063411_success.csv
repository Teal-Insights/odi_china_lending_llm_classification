67010,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides $198.6 million preferential buyer’s credit for Surcin-Obrenovac Section of Highway E-763 Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#66978),"On August 20, 2009, the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of Serbia entered into an Agreement on Economic and Technical Cooperation in the field of Infrastructure, which entered into force on June 25, 2010. Then, on April 26, 2012, the Government of the People’s Republic of China announced that it had set up a 10 billion U.S. dollar line of credit to support cooperative projects with Central and Eastern Europe. The credit line would be partially in the form of preferential loans and would fund projects in the infrastructure, technology and green economy sectors.   On November 5, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of the Republic of Serbia’s Ministry of Finance and Economy signed a preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK NO. PBC (2016) 32 (420)] worth $198,618,888 for the Surcin-Obrenovac Section of the Highway E-763 Construction Project.

The Government of the Republic of Serbia’s Ministry of Finance and Economy subsequently signed an on-lending agreement with Public Enterprise “Roads of Serbia” (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Government of the Republic of Serbia) for the Surcin-Obrenovac Section of the Highway E-763 Construction Project. The proceeds from this on-lending agreement were used to finance 85% of the $233,669,280 value of the commercial contract [number 351-5684/2016-2] between the Government of the Republic of Serbia’s Ministry of Construction, Transport and Infrastructure, Public Enterprise “Roads of Serbia”, and China Communications Construction Company Ltd. (CCCC), which was signed on June 18, 2016.   The borrower made principal repayments worth approximately $6,621,000 in 2022.

The project involved the construction of a new highway (A2 or E-763) segment from Surcin to Obrenovac that measures 17.6 km in length. It is significant in that it will establish a direct connection between Corridor 11 and Corridor 10, and between the city of Belgrade and the Corridor 11. CCCC is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Its work was overseen by Public Enterprise “Roads of Serbia”. The China Eximbank PBC entered into force in February 2017.

It purchased 98% of the plant's assets, saving the over 100-year-old plant from bankruptcy.  In order to support the acquisition from Železara Smederevo, the Hebei Branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) provided an EUR 27.6 million acquisition loan (captured via Project ID#95965) and an EUR 50 million working capital loan  (captured via Project ID#95935)  to Hesteel Group Company Limited. These loans were backed by a credit insurance policy from Sinosure. Then, in June 2016, Bank of China extended a $600 million loan  (captured via Project ID#67013) to Hesteel Group Company Limited to support the Zelezara Steel Mill Modernization Project.    The purpose of the project was to modernize the Zelezara Steel Mill in the city of Smederevo. Renamed Hesteel Serbia, the plant now employs over 5,000 workers, bringing local unemployment rates down to 6 percent from 18 percent. In 2017, the plant was expected to generate revenue of $800 million and a profit of $20 million. In 2018, the plant produced 1.77 million metric tons of steel, becoming Serbia’s largest exporter with sales of 750 million euros.    However, the Zelezara Steel Mill Modernization Project has also provoked local controversy. According to a November 2021 report from Reuters: “a few hundred meters from the huge furnaces of the Chinese-owned Smedrevo steel mill in central Serbia, the village of Radinac is covered in thick red dust. Cancer rates have quadrupled in under a decade, and residents want the plant to clean up or shut down. Zoran, 70, a throat cancer patient who speaks with a voice prosthesis after his larynx was removed, said residents must dry their laundry indoors and use vinegar to clean the dust from their cars. ‘Water cannot wash it off,’ he said. ‘We do not go out. We do not dare.’    According to data from the Smederevo public health body, which a watchdog called Tvrdjava obtained through a freedom of information request and shared with Reuters, the municipality of around 100,000 people reported 6,866 cancer cases in 2019, up from 1,738 in 2011. The plant says it has invested 300 million euros in technology and pollution reduction since China's biggest steelmaker, Hesteel […], bought it from the Serbian state for 46 million euros ($53 million) five years ago. ‘We are all citizens of Smederevo.... Would we be working despite pollution, against ourselves and our children?’ the plant's manager for environmental protection, Ljubica Drake, said in a statement to Reuters. Three new production facilities will significantly reduce pollution after their completion in 2022, she said. It was ‘not correct’ to conclude that higher cancer rates were caused by the plant's activities, she said, adding that the disease could be a result of NATO's bombing of Serbia in 1999 during a war in Kosovo. But activists say the plant is an example of Chinese-owned industrial firms ignoring pollution standards.    Nikola Krstic, the head of Tvrdjava, an environmental group whose name means The Fort, said an analysis of the red dust in September [2021] showed high concentration of heavy metals. ‘The air in the town is far below European standards for 120 days per year,’ he told Reuters. ‘Red dust is greasy, it sticks to lungs, makes breathing difficult.’  […] The authorities in Belgrade say they are prepared to challenge Chinese-owned companies over pollution’.","1.

In order to support the acquisition from Železara Smederevo, the Hebei Branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) provided an EUR 27.6 million acquisition loan (captured via Project ID#95965) and an EUR 50 million working capital loan (captured via Project ID#95935)  to Hesteel Group Company Limited. These loans were backed by a credit insurance policy from Sinosure. Then, in June 2016, Bank of China extended a $600 million loan  (captured via Project ID#67013) to Hesteel Group Company Limited to support the Zelezara Steel Mill Modernization Project.    The purpose of the project was to modernize the Zelezara Steel Mill in the city of Smederevo. Renamed Hesteel Serbia, the plant now employs over 5,000 workers, bringing local unemployment rates down to 6 percent from 18 percent. In 2017, the plant was expected to generate revenue of $800 million and a profit of $20 million. In 2018, the plant produced 1.77 million metric tons of steel, becoming Serbia’s largest exporter with sales of 750 million euros.    However, the Zelezara Steel Mill Modernization Project has also provoked local controversy. According to a November 2021 report from Reuters: “a few hundred meters from the huge furnaces of the Chinese-owned Smedrevo steel mill in central Serbia, the village of Radinac is covered in thick red dust. Cancer rates have quadrupled in under a decade, and residents want the plant to clean up or shut down. Zoran, 70, a throat cancer patient who speaks with a voice prosthesis after his larynx was removed, said residents must dry their laundry indoors and use vinegar to clean the dust from their cars. ‘Water cannot wash it off,’ he said. ‘We do not go out. We do not dare.’    According to data from the Smederevo public health body, which a watchdog called Tvrdjava obtained through a freedom of information request and shared with Reuters, the municipality of around 100,000 people reported 6,866 cancer cases in 2019, up from 1,738 in 2011. The plant says it has invested 300 million euros in technology and pollution reduction since China's biggest steelmaker, Hesteel […], bought it from the Serbian state for 46 million euros ($53 million) five years ago. ‘We are all citizens of Smederevo.... Would we be working despite pollution, against ourselves and our children?’ the plant's manager for environmental protection, Ljubica Drake, said in a statement to Reuters. Three new production facilities will significantly reduce pollution after their completion in 2022, she said. It was ‘not correct’ to conclude that higher cancer rates were caused by the plant's activities, she said, adding that the disease could be a result of NATO's bombing of Serbia in 1999 during a war in Kosovo. But activists say the plant is an example of Chinese-owned industrial firms ignoring pollution standards.    Nikola Krstic, the head of Tvrdjava, an environmental group whose name means The Fort, said an analysis of the red dust in September [2021] showed high concentration of heavy metals. ‘The air in the town is far below European standards for 120 days per year,’ he told Reuters. ‘Red dust is greasy, it sticks to lungs, makes breathing difficult.’  […] The authorities in Belgrade say they are prepared to challenge Chinese-owned companies over pollution.",TRUE,NA,BROWN,HIGH,Other Energy (Fossil Fuels),"The project involves the modernization of a steel mill, which is a high-emission industrial facility with significant environmental and health impacts, including pollution and increased cancer rates in the local population.","The Zelezara Steel Mill Modernization Project has caused local controversy due to pollution, with reports of thick red dust, high concentrations of heavy metals, and a significant increase in cancer rates. Despite investments in pollution reduction, the plant remains a major source of environmental harm."
