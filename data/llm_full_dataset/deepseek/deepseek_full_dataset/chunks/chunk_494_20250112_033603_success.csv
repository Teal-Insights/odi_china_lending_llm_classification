Then, on February 10, 2020, the RMB 18 billion (EGP 41 billion) currency swap agreement was renewed for another three years.  In early 2017, the CBE made a (gross) drawdown under the currency swap agreement equivalent RMB 18 billion. The PBOC credited RMB 18 billion to the CBE's account held with PBOC, and the CBE credited PBOC's account held with CBE with the EGP equivalent (49,249,800,000) of RMB 18 billion, based on the RMB-EGP exchange rate of 1:2.7361 at that time. The borrowing (drawdown) carried an estimated maturity of 1 year and an unknown interest rates (based on SHIBOR plus a margin). According to CBE, it made four additional (gross) drawdowns under the PBOC currency swap agreement: an RMB 18 billion drawdown in 2018, an RMB 18 billion drawdown in 2019, an RMB 18 billion drawdown in 2020, and an RMB 18 billion drawdown in 2021. These borrowings (drawdowns) also carried estimated maturities of 1 year and unknown interest rates (based on SHIBOR plus a margin).  The CBE’s 2017 drawdown is captured via Project ID#89406. Its 2018 drawdown is captured via Project ID#89408. Its 2019 drawdown is captured via Project ID#89410. Its 2020 drawdown is captured via Project ID#96200. Its 2021 drawdown is captured via Project ID#96201. The (principal) amount outstanding under CBE’s PBOC swap facility was RMB 0 in 2016, RMB 18 billion in 2017, RMB 18 billion in 2018, RMB 18 billion in 2019, RMB 18 billion in 2020, and RMB 18 billion in 2021.","1. A bilateral currency swap (BCS) agreement — also known as a central bank liquidity swap agreement — is an agreement between the central banks of two countries to exchange cash flows in different currencies at predetermined rates over a specified period of time. Central banks participate in these agreements to facilitate bilateral trade settlements using their national currencies (rather than relying upon a third-party currency such as the U.S. dollar), manage demands from their local banks, and provide liquidity support to financial markets. The party that draws down on the swap line becomes the borrower and the other party becomes lender. During the term of the swap, the party that draws down on the swap line makes either fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amount. If both parties draw down on the swap line, then both parties exchange fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amounts. The 5-step process of drawing upon a currency swap line with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) can described from the perspective of an importer in a given country (‘Country X’) seeking to settle trade with a Chinese firm in RMB. Step 1: The central bank of Country X and the PBOC activate their currency swap in advance, at which point each party deposits a specific amount of its currency in an account controlled by the other party (i.e. the central bank of Country X deposits local currency in an account controlled by the PBOC, and the PBOC deposits an equivalent amount in RMB in an account controlled by the central bank of Country X). Step 2: A firm in Country X that imports goods from China applies for an RMB-denominated loan from a domestic bank. Step 3: The domestic bank in Country X that receives the loan application then applies to its central bank for an RMB-denominated loan. After a review process, the central bank of Country X notifies the domestic bank applicant that its loan application was approved. The central bank of Country X subsequently requests that the PBOC transfer RMB funds from the central bank of Country X’s swap account within the PBOC to the loan applicant’s account with a corresponding bank in China. Step 4: The domestic bank in Country X directs the corresponding bank in China to transfer RMB funds into a Chinese exporter’s account, and the corresponding bank in China provides RMB funds to the Chinese exporter. Step 5: The importer in Country X repays the RMB-denominated loan at its maturity date. The domestic bank notifies the central bank of Country X of the repayment, and transfers RMB into the central bank’s account within the PBOC through the corresponding bank in China. For the central bank of Country X, the RMB deposit is an asset that should be recorded on its balance sheet as an official reserve asset denominated in RMB. The contra entry of this asset is the liability in the local currency of Country X that represents China’s claims in the central bank of Country X. This should be also recorded on the balance sheet of the central bank of Country X. At the time of the exchange of currencies, it should be recorded as an increase in assets and an increase in liabilities of the monetary authorities in the balance of payments. The reason why the PBOC uses this mechanism to provide renminbi liquidity to other central bank is to increase the speed, convenience, and volume of transactions between the two countries. More detailed information about currency swaps with the PBOC can be found at https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021210-print-pdf.ashx and https://thechinaguys.com/the-rise-of-the-renminbi-the-reality-of-bilateral-swap-agreements/ and https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2017/pdf/17-25a.pdf.2. AidData treats drawdowns under BCS agreements with the PBOC as collateralized loans because, in a BCS arrangement, the currency of the borrower is held as collateral while the lender receives interest on the amount drawn down by the borrower until repayment is made.3. CBE’s currency swap with the PBOC is classified as ‘short term debt’ in the Government of Egypt’s 2020 bond prospectus and in various CBE reports. CBE defines short-term debt as debt ‘with [an] original maturity of up to one year,’ so AidData has coded the maturity length as 1 year for the time being. A paper prepared by the Central Bank of Egypt indicates the 'withdrawal and utilization' period to be up to one year in the currency swap (see https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2017/pdf/17-25a.pdf). However, the precise term (maturity length) of the swap agreement is unknown. This issue requires further investigation.4. The interest rate that applied to CBE’s RMB 18 billion drawdown is unknown, but it was very likely SHIBOR plus a margin (see https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021210-print-pdf.ashx). This issue requires further investigation.5. Most central banks publish their end-of-year outstanding PBOC swap debt, but only a few report detailed transaction-level data on drawdowns during the year. Therefore, if no information on drawings is available, AidData assumes that total drawdowns during the reporting period equal the amount outstanding at the end of the reporting period (and vice versa). Since the (de jure) maturities of PBOC swap drawings are 12 months or less, this creates a lower bound estimate for actual drawdowns under the PBOC swap line. 6. PBOC swap debt is frequently rolled over. In central bank reports where one can only observe the year-end outstanding amount, no distinction between rollovers and drawdowns is possible. In these cases, one can derive (new) drawdowns as the difference between the current and last year’s outstanding swap debt stock. This measure essentially captures net lending through the PBOC swap line.","# Sector

Reporting from the Central Bank of Egypt suggests that CDB subsequently ‘upsized’ the face value of the liquidity support facility agreement from $1 billion to $2 billion. However, the precise timing of this $1 billion (RMB 7 billion) increase in the face value of the loan is unknown.   The Central Bank of Egypt reports that the amount outstanding under the LSF was $1.8 billion in September 2019, $1.5 billion in September 2020, $1.6 billion in December 2020, $1.3 billion in March 2021, $1.3 billion in June 2021, $1.1 billion in September 2021, $1.1 billion in December 2021, $842.9 million in March 2022, $817.8 million in June 2022, $560.5 million as of September 2022, and $567.2 million in December 2022.",TRUE,NA,NEUTRAL,HIGH,Financial Services,Project involves financial liquidity support without direct environmental or energy transition impacts,"Liquidity support facility agreement between China Development Bank and Central Bank of Egypt, focused on macroeconomic stability and foreign exchange reserves"
52700,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides RMB 4.604 billion government concessional loan for Cairo to 10th of Ramadan Light Rail Transit (LRT) Project (Linked to Project ID#58094 and #64740),"On April 2, 2014, AVIC International signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Egyptian Ministry of Communications on the Cairo to 10th of Ramadan Light Rail Transit (LRT) Project. Then, on August 15, 2017, Egypt’s National Authority for Tunnels (NAT) signed an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract worth $1.239 billion with a consortium consisting of AVIC International and China Railway Eryuan Engineering Group, a subsidiary of China Railway Group. Then, on November 5, 2017, at the “BRICS Summit” in Xiamen, China, the Egyptian Ministry of Investment and International Cooperation and China’s Ministry of Commerce signed a MoU on the implementation of the Cairo to 10th of Ramadan Light Rail Transit (LRT) Project. On September 1, 2018, two agreements were signed by the Chinese Government and the Egyptian Government in support of the Cairo to 10th of Ramadan Light Rail Transit (LRT) Project: an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA), authorizing the provision of an RMB 350 million (approximately $51 million) interest-free loan from China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM); and a government concessional loan (GCL) from China Eximbank worth RMB 4.604 billion (approximately $674 million). Then, on January 15, 2019, the Egyptian House of Representatives passed two government resolutions [Resolution No. 497 (2018) and Resolution No. 496 (2018)], approving the RMB 350 million interest-free loan from MOFCOM and the RMB 4.604 billion loan from China Eximbank.   Multiple sources refer to these two loans (collectively worth an estimated $739 million) as providing the ‘first tranche’ of funding for the Cairo to 10th of Ramadan Light Rail Transit (LRT) Project. The MOFCOM loan was issued to Egypt’s National Authority for Tunnels (埃及国家隧道局) and it appears to carry the following terms: a 20 year maturity, a 10 year grace period, and a 0% interest rate. The Government of Egypt issued a sovereign guarantee in support of this loan. The China Eximbank loan was also issued to Egypt’s National Authority for Tunnels and it appears to carry the following terms: a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, and a 1.8% interest rate. It too benefited from a sovereign guarantee.   Then, on January 16, 2019, China Eximbank and Egypt’s National Authority for Tunnels signed another loan agreement for the Cairo to 10th of Ramadan Light Rail Transit (LRT) Project, which reportedly carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 2 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. This loan also benefited from a sovereign guarantee. Some sources identify the face value of this loan as $1.239 billion (covering both the first and second tranches of funding), while others refer to the face value of the loan as $461 million (covering only the second tranche of funding).   For the time being, AidData assumes that the first tranche of funding was officially committed on September 1, 2018 and the second tranche of funding was officially committed on January 16, 2019. The RMB 350 million loan is captured via Project ID#64740. The RMB 4.604 billion loan is captured via Project ID#52700. The $461 million loan is captured via Project ID#58094. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of these loans to finance the $1.239 billion commercial (EPC) contract between Egypt’s National Authority for Tunnels (NAT), AVIC International, and China Railway Eryuan Engineering Group, which was signed on August 15, 2017.   The purpose of the project is to build a Light Rail Transit (LRT) network that extends from El Salam to New Administrative Capital to 10 Ramadan City. The electric light railway will extend 67.8 km (42 miles) from 10th of Ramadan City to Egypt’s New Administrative Capital with 11 stops/stations (in the cities of Salam, Obour, Shorouk, Mostaqbal, Robeiky, and the New Administrative Capital). 61 km of the lines will be above ground, 0.7 km below ground, and 6.1 km will be elevated. Some 7.5 kilometers will be in the form of a bridge, while 0.3 kilometers will be in the form of a tunnel. The speed of the trains will be 120 km/h. The trains will be equipped with non-internal-combustion diesel engines.   The line will start from Adly Mansour Station that is reached by the third metro line, and at Robeiky will be divided into two branches. One will head north in parallel to the Regional Ring Road to the 10th of Ramadan City and the other will head South to the New Administrative Capital. The line will be operated within two years, and will be executed by five Egyptian companies along with the railroads and the fence.  The Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) will accomplish the signaling, communication, control, and electricity systems afterwards. It will also manufacture and supply 22 trains. In the second phase, the line will extend to the Sports City near Al-Ain Al-Sokhna so that its length will be 93 kilometers.   The project is intended to reduce the travel time between the 10th of Ramadan City to the New Administrative Capital by about 30%. The realization of the Electric Light Railway Project is expected to reduce traffic, principally on Ismailia highway. Additionally, the project is expected to stimulate Egypt’s construction industry, providing jobs to many.   AVIC International and China Railway Eryuan Engineering Group are the general contractors responsible for implementation. Their subcontractors include: (1) a joint venture between TSO and Orascom Construction (for track laying and the construction of 11 stations); (2) Arab Contractors (for construction of Adly Mansour, New Heliopolis and Robaikey stations); (3) Hassan Allam Holding (for construction of the New Government Capital and New Administrative Capital stations); (4) Concord (for construction of Badr and Shorouk stations); (5) Petrojet (for construction of Abour and Future stations); (6) The Holding Co. for Roads, Bridges and Land Transportation Projects (for construction of Industrial Park and Ramadan 1 stations); (7) CRRC Qingdao Sifang (for supply of rolling stock); (8) Consortium of CASCO and China Huaxin (for signaling and communication system); and (9) Siveco China [for supply of Maintenance Management System (MMS)]. In January 2019, China Eximbank reportedly agreed to disburse a $105 million tranche within a month to facilitate the commencement of civil works.   The project was originally expected to begin implementation on January 20, 2019. However, civil works did not commence until May 2019. On October 30, 2020, Egypt’s Transport Minister Kamal El-Wazir conducted an inspection tour of the project. At that time, the project had achieved a 63% completion rate. Bridges were 47% complete, tunnels were 86% complete, and the maintenance workshop was 63% complete. Then, on March 18, 2021, Shenzhen Metro and AVIC International signed a comprehensive joint commissioning service contract for the Cairo to 10th of Ramadan Light Rail Transit (LRT) Project. The first of 22 trains (manufactured by CRRC Qingdao Sifang) left a port in Shandong in July 2021 and arrived in Egypt on September 7, 2021. As of November 2021, 6 trains had arrived and 95% of construction activities were complete. According to the Egyptian State Information Service, as of May 9, 2022, all 22 trains acquired as part of the project had been received by the Egyptian Ministry of Transportation and they were undergoing testing, with the National Authority for Tunnels confirming that the train line was being 'operated experimentally' as of June 5, 2022.","1. This project is also known as the 10th of Ramadan Railway Project, the Suburban Railway Project of Tenth of Ramadan City, Egypt Ramadan City Railway Project, the Egyptian Electric Railway Project, the Light Railway Project, and the 10 Ramadan-Salam Train Project. The Chinese project title is 埃及“斋月十日城”市郊铁路项目 or 埃及斋月十日城铁路项目 or 中埃铁路项目. The Arabic project title is مشروع القطار الكهربائى السلام ـ العاصمة الإدارية2. The borrower may have been authorized to use the proceeds of the loans to finance a rolling stock (vehicle supply) contract that was issued to CRRC Qingdao Sifang on December 3, 2018, an automation and controls contract (or Communication and Signaling System Procurement and Maintenance Framework Contract) that was issued to China Huaxin Post and Telecom Technologies (Huaxin) on August 23, 2019, and an operation and supervision service contract that AVIC International, China Railway Group and Shenzhen Metro signed on December 6, 2019. This issue merits further investigation. 3. MOFCOM is the lending institution responsible for the provision of the RMB 350 million interest-free loan but the proceeds of the loan were disbursed through a China Development Bank (CDB) account that was established with a host country bank. 4. In the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020, two China Eximbank loans for the Cairo to 10th of Ramadan Light Rail Transit (LRT) Project are recorded, but not the RMB 350 million interest-free loan from MOFCOM.5.
