The IDB would also administer a B loan (Loan 3500B/OC-UR-1-US-FITCPIB, Loan 3500B/OC-UR-2-US-FITCPIB), which would be financed by another commercial bank or financial institution. The IDB lists the total anticipated project cost as 139,220,000 USD, with an expected 54,220,000 USD of counterpart financing.  The IDB approved this loan financing on 7 July 2015, and it refers to this project as ""UR-L1100 : Casablanca and Giacote Solar PV Project"". The loan recipients listed in the approval document were Giacote S.A., Raditon S.A., Dicano S.A., Fenima S.A. and Petilocoran S.A. The project sponsors would be Sky Solar and Lafemir S.A.

As of 2 August 2020, according to implementing agency Tecnogroup, all photovoltaic projects are still under construction.  With a total installed capacity of 69.9MW the project will supply an average of 125.4 GWh of electricity per year to the national grid, helping to diversify Uruguay’s energy matrix and eliminating approximately 74,000 tons per year of CO2 emissions. The photovoltaic panels will be mounted over fixed steel structures expected to be provided locally through a joint venture between Lafemir S.A. and an industry-leading manufacturer. Resources will also be used to support the implementation of a climate change education initiative that will encourage young people to use their creativity and energy to come up with feasible, sustainable, long-term strategies to mitigate climate change.
