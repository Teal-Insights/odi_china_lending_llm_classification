87051,ACTION RELATING TO DEBT,"CDB provides loan to Sonangol for debt refinancing purposes (Linked to Project ID#66847, #95415, #53063)","On December 9, 2015, China Development Bank (CDB) entered into a $15 billion loan agreement (captured via Project ID#66847) with the Government of Angola. The loan is an oil prepayment facility with repayments being serviced through receivables from a designated oil contract. The pricing structure of the loan allows the Government of Angola to benefit from an upside in an increase in the price of oil. The loan has a maturity of 12 years and its availability period expired on December 9, 2017.    As a condition of the loan agreement, the lender required the borrower to maintain a minimum cash balance of approximately $1.5 billion in an escrow account known as the Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA). The proceeds of the loan facility were used to be used to recapitalize Sonangol, help Sonangol prepay some of its outstanding debts to CDB, and finance a series of public investment projects. As of December 31, 2017, the loan had achieved a 100% disbursement rate. Repayments commenced in 2018. The loan’s amount outstanding was $14.9 billion in December 2018, $14.5 billion as of June 30, 2019, and $11.3 billion as of December 31, 2021.    In 2016, China Development Bank approved a $10 billion subsidiary loan through this facility (captured via Project ID#53063) to enable the Government of Angola to recapitalize Sonangol — Angola’s state-owned oil company — and help Sonangol prepay some of its outstanding debts to CDB. Sonangol had previously borrowed $7.5 billion from CDB between 2010 and 2014, and through an on-lending arrangement with the Government of Angola, Sonangol used $6.9 billion of the proceeds of the $10 billion loan to prepay several outstanding debts to CDB, including a $2.5 billion loan in 2010 for the Phase 1 of Kilamba Kiaxi Housing Construction Project (captured via Project ID#47101), a $2 billion loan in 2011 to support Sonangol’s development efforts (captured via Project ID#47102), and a $1 billion loan in 2012 to support Sonangol’s development efforts (captured via Project ID#47103).     According to the IMF, the $6.9 billion that was on-lent to Sonangol (as part of the $10 billion subsidiary loan) had a net value of $3.8 billion because part of it was used to refinance existing debt, implying that only $3.1 billion was used for re-financing. According to the IMF, after this recapitalization, Sonangol ‘significantly reduced its external debt, which [was] projected to decline to about US$5 billion at end-2018, from US$12.9 billion at end-2015.’ Therefore, rather than having the country’s state-owned oil company struggle to pay back CDB loans that were coming due, the Government of Angola effectively moved Sonangol’s CDB debts onto its own balance sheet.  There are clear indications that the December 2015 CDB loan financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In December 2020, CDB and the Government of Angola entered into an agreement to reprofile multiple loan agreements that they had previously signed, including the $15 billion loan agreement from December 2015 (as captured via Project ID#95415). The December 2020 agreement included (i) a three-year deferral of principal payments; and (ii) repayment of deferred principal falling due in 2020H2–2023H1 over seven years after the grace period, with some additional modest relief of principal in 2024–25.   The Government of Angola also agreed to use the outstanding cash balance in an escrow account — known as the Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) — to make interest payments to the CDB between 2020 to 2022, which it expected would bring the DSRA balance to nearly zero by mid-2022. However, under the terms of the debt reprofiling agreement, the parties agreed that the borrower would need to replenish the DSRA to approximately $1.5 billion (the minimum cash balance previously agreed upon by the lender and borrower) by 2023.","1. There is a discrepancy in the reported value of on-lending to Sonangol between two official sources: the IMF 2017 Article IV Staff Report and the Government of Angola’s November 2019 bond prospectus. The former suggests that the central government on-lent $6.9 million and the latter suggests that the central government on-lent $10 billion. For the time being, AidData relies on the Government of Angola’s November 2019 bond prospectus for the total amount on-lent to Sonangol and relies on the IMF’s 2017 Article IV Staff Report for the breakdown of the $10 billion. AidData assumes for the time being that the Government of Angola on-lent $10 billion to Sonangol, of which $3.1 billion was used to refinance Sonangol’s existing CDB debts. Therefore, AidData has coded the transaction (financial commitment) amount as $6.9 billion to avoid double-counting CDB loans that Sonangol previously contracted. 2. In the Chinese Loans to Africa (CLA) Database that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020 and updated in March 2021 (which is now maintained by Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center), a $10 billion loan from CDB to the Government of Angola is recorded to captured the recapitalization of Sonangol. The CLA database does not expunge the portion of the loan ($3.1 billion) that was used to refinance Sonangol’s existing CDB debts. 3. AidData Project ID#87051 captures the portion of the loan used for re-financing, though no transaction (financial commitment) amount has been recorded.  4. Oil prepayment contracts are also known as pre-export finance (PXF) facilities. A PXF facility is an arrangement in which a commodity (e.g. oil) producer gets up-front cash from a customer in return for a promise to repay the customer with that commodity (possibly at a discount) in the future. PXF funds may be advanced by a lender or syndicate of lenders to a commodity producer to assist the company in meeting either its working capital needs (for example, to cover the purchase of raw materials and costs associated with processing, storage and transport) or its capital investment needs (for example, investment in plant and machinery and other elements of infrastructure). PXF facilities are usually secured by (1) an assignment of rights by the producer under an ‘offtake contract’ (i.e., a sale and purchase contract between the producer and a buyer of that producer of goods or commodities), and (2) a collection account charge over a bank account into which proceeds due to the producer from the buyer of the goods or commodities under the offtake contract are credited. There are two key documents in prepayment finance transactions: a contract providing for the advance payment by the offtaker to the producer for the purchase of goods/commodities (the 'Prepayment Contract'), and a loan agreement between a lender and the offtaker (the 'Offtaker Loan Agreement') under which the advance payment is financed.5. The interest rate and grace period that apply to the December 9, 2015 loan are unknown. For the time being, AidData relies on the weighted average interest rate (4.334%) and weighted average grace period (3.8333) that the World Bank's Debtor Reporting System (DRS) identifies as applying to China's official sector lending to Angola in 2015.

54912,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",China Eximbank provides RMB 600 million government concessional loan for Port of St John’s Renovation and Extension Project,"On December 21, 2007, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with regard to utilizing a Chinese Government Concessional Loan to execute the Port of St John’s Renovation and Extension Project. On November 18, 2013, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) signed an updated Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with regard to utilizing a Chinese Government Concessional Loan to execute the Port of St John’s Renovation and Extension Project. Then, on November 11, 2014, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda submitted a project proposal and application for a Chinese Government Concessional Loan to the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Antigua. On December 22, 2014, Antigua and Barbuda Port Authority and CCECC signed an RMB 1,590,000,000 commercial (‘design and construction’) contract (#AB/PMP-01) for the Port of St John’s Renovation and Extension Project. Then, on May 25, 2015, Antigua and Barbuda Port Authority and CCECC signed a revised commercial contract (#AB/PMP-02) worth RMB 585,000,000. Then, on November 25, 2016, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Government of Antigua and Barbuda signed an RMB 600 million government concessional loan (GCL) for the Port of St John’s Renovation and Extension Project. Less than a month later, on December 15, 2016, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Government of Antigua and Barbuda signed a framework agreement for a RMB 600 million government concessional loan (GCL) for the Port of St John’s Renovation and Extension Project. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 2 percent interest rate, a grace period of 5 years, and a maturity of 21.75 years. The final maturity date of the GCL is March 19, 2038. The proceeds of the GCL were to be used by the borrower to finance the RMB 585,000,000 commercial contract that was signed on May 25, 2015. The remaining RMB 15,000,000 was to be used by the borrower to finance a contract with Guangxi Bagui Project Supervision and Consultant Co. Ltd for project management and supervision activities related to the Port of St John’s Renovation and Extension Project. The borrower also agreed to deposit the operating income generated by the project in an escrow account to support debt service requirements.   The purpose of the project is to bring about the long-awaited transformation of the St. John’s Port from a break-bulk facility to a modern container port facility that is capable of increasing annual cargo throughput from 16,000 containers to 80,000 containers. It involves the construction of a new Customs and Port Authority headquarters, the expansion of a quay (extension of the existing pier), the construction of a new warehouse for processing goods, the extension of a sea wall, the dredging of the harbor, and the establishment of a logistics park. Some of the expected project benefits include improved ship-to-shore interface; greater efficiency in the clearance of goods; automated scanning and computerized handling/clearance of goods; reduced ground transportation costs, and greater ease of doing business.   CCECC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on January 15, 2018. However, the project did not commence until September 8, 2018. It was originally envisaged that the project would take three years to implement.  Satellite imagery suggests that, as of July 2020, a 320-meter quay expansion and the construction of a new warehouse were complete (or nearly completed).  Satellite imagery from July 2020 also suggests that, on the northern side of the port, land had been built up for what is likely the new sea wall and a set of buildings and a parking lot had been constructed, while another pier to the south was being added to the existing cruise terminal. The construction of the container terminal was officially completed and handed over to the local authorities on October 13, 2020. St. John’s Port has reportedly become the only port with professional container transshipment terminal and automated cross-transshipment capacity in eastern Caribbean region, thus helping Antigua and Barbuda in building itself into a regional logistics center and promoting the country’s economic and social development.","1.

95682,BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES,BCRA makes RMB 70 billion drawdown under currency swap agreement with PBOC in 2016,"On April 2009, the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (Banco Central de la República Argentina, or BCRA) and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) signed an RMB 70 billion ($11 billion) bilateral currency swap agreement to facilitate trade and improve foreign currency liquidity in Argentina. The agreement was extended for an additional three years in July 2014.   BCRA made (gross) drawdowns under the currency swap agreement equivalent to approximately RMB 14.2 billon between October 2014 and December 2014 — through an RMB 5.2 billion ($814 million) drawdown on October 30, 2014, and RMB 3 billion ($507 million) drawdown on November 17, 2014, and an RMB 6 billion ($1.14 billion) drawdown in December 2014. These borrowings carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 4% margin (400 basis points) and a 1-year maturity length.   BCRA also made (gross) drawdowns under the currency swap agreement equivalent to approximately RMB 70 billion — including but not limited to an RMB 2.5 billion ($400 million) drawdown in early January 2015, an RMB 2.5 billion ($400 million) drawdown in late January 2015, and a $1.5 billion drawdown in March 2015. These borrowings also carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 4% margin (400 basis points) and a 1-year maturity length.   Then, on December 16, 2015, BCRA and PBOC signed a supplementary agreement, authorizing (a) the conversion of the RMB that BCRA receives from PBOC in exchange for Argentine pesos (ARS) into any currency (including U.S. dollars) and (b) the use of such funds to service foreign debt obligations. These concessions from PBOC were valuable to BCRA because the Government of Argentina was having difficulty borrowing dollars on international markets after defaulting on its debt in July 2014.   During calendar year 2016, BCRA made (gross) drawdowns under its currency swap agreement with the PBOC equivalent to approximately RMB 70 billion.   Then, on July 18, 2017, BCRA and PBOC extended their RMB 70 billion (ARS 175 billion) bilateral currency swap agreement by an additional three years. During calendar year 2017, BCRA made (gross) drawdowns under its currency swap agreement with the PBOC equivalent to approximately RMB 70 billion.   Then, in 2018, BCRA and PBOC amended the July 18, 2017 agreement to increase the size of the currency swap from RMB 70 billion to RMB 130 billion (approximately $19 billion) — roughly equivalent to one-third of the BCRA’s foreign reserve assets. The 2018 agreement also specified that the PBOC could reject currency swap drawdowns by the BCRA if the Government of Argentina’s IMF standby agreement was suspended or cancelled.   During calendar year 2018, BCRA made (gross) drawdowns under its expanded currency swap agreement with the PBOC equivalent to approximately RMB 130 billion — including but not limited to an RMB 60 billion ($8.7 billion) drawdown on December 17, 2018. These borrowings carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 4% margin (400 basis points) and a 1-year maturity length.   During calendar year 2019, BCRA made (gross) drawdowns under its expanded currency swap agreement with the PBOC equivalent to approximately RMB 130 billion. These borrowings carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 4% margin (400 basis points) and a 1-year maturity length.   The 70 billion currency swap agreement was extended for an additional 3 years on July 17, 2020 and the RMB 60 billion currency swap agreement was extended for an additional 3 years on September 17, 2020.   During calendar year 2020, BCRA made (gross) drawdowns under its expanded currency swap agreement with the PBOC equivalent to approximately RMB 130 billion. These borrowings carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 4% margin (400 basis points) and a 3-month maturity length.   BCRA also made (gross) drawdowns under its expanded currency swap agreement with the PBOC equivalent to approximately RMB 130 billion during calendar year 2021. These borrowings carried an interest rate of SHIBOR plus a 4% margin (400 basis points) and a 3-month maturity length. As of December 2021, total PBOC swap debt (RMB 130 billion or $20.4 billion) represented 51% of the BCRA’s foreign currency reserves.   The BCRA’s 2014 drawdowns are captured via Project ID#89411. Its 2015 drawdowns are captured via Project ID#89414. Its 2016 drawdowns are captured via Project ID#95682. Its 2017 drawdowns are captured via Project ID#95912. Its 2018 drawdowns are captured via Project ID#89416. Its 2019 drawdowns are captured via Project ID#96263. Its 2020 drawdowns are captured via Project ID#96264. Its 2021 drawdowns are captured via Project ID#96322. According to the BCRA, the total (principal) amount outstanding under the PBOC currency swap facility was RMB 14.2 billion ($2,320,635,000) in 2014, RMB 70 billion ($10,783,360,000) in 2015, RMB 70 billion ($10,072,230,000) in 2016, RMB 70 billion ($10,750,040,000) in 2017, RMB 130 billion ($18,969,730,000) in 2018, RMB 130 billion ($18,605,990,000) in 2019, RMB 130 billion ($19,893,250,000) in 2020, and RMB 130 billion ($20,406,880,000) in 2021.","1. A bilateral currency swap (BCS) agreement — also known as a central bank liquidity swap agreement — is an agreement between the central banks of two countries to exchange cash flows in different currencies at predetermined rates over a specified period of time. Central banks participate in these agreements to facilitate bilateral trade settlements using their national currencies (rather than relying upon a third-party currency such as the U.S. dollar), manage demands from their local banks, and provide liquidity support to financial markets. The party that draws down on the swap line becomes the borrower and the other party becomes lender. During the term of the swap, the party that draws down on the swap line makes either fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amount. If both parties draw down on the swap line, then both parties exchange fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amounts. The 5-step process of drawing upon a currency swap line with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) can described from the perspective of an importer in a given country (‘Country X’) seeking to settle trade with a Chinese firm in RMB. Step 1: The central bank of Country X and the PBOC activate their currency swap in advance, at which point each party deposits a specific amount of its currency in an account controlled by the other party (i.e. the central bank of Country X deposits local currency in an account controlled by the PBOC, and the PBOC deposits an equivalent amount in RMB in an account controlled by the central bank of Country X). Step 2: A firm in Country X that imports goods from China applies for an RMB-denominated loan from a domestic bank. Step 3: The domestic bank in Country X that receives the loan application then applies to its central bank for an RMB-denominated loan. After a review process, the central bank of Country X notifies the domestic bank applicant that its loan application was approved. The central bank of Country X subsequently requests that the PBOC transfer RMB funds from the central bank of Country X’s swap account within the PBOC to the loan applicant’s account with a corresponding bank in China. Step 4: The domestic bank in Country X directs the corresponding bank in China to transfer RMB funds into a Chinese exporter’s account, and the corresponding bank in China provides RMB funds to the Chinese exporter. Step 5: The importer in Country X repays the RMB-denominated loan at its maturity date. The domestic bank notifies the central bank of Country X of the repayment, and transfers RMB into the central bank’s account within the PBOC through the corresponding bank in China. For the central bank of Country X, the RMB deposit is an asset that should be recorded on its balance sheet as an official reserve asset denominated in RMB. The contra entry of this asset is the liability in the local currency of Country X that represents China’s claims in the central bank of Country X. This should be also recorded on the balance sheet of the central bank of Country X. At the time of the exchange of currencies, it should be recorded as an increase in assets and an increase in liabilities of the monetary authorities in the balance of payments. The reason why the PBOC uses this mechanism to provide renminbi liquidity to other central bank is to increase the speed, convenience, and volume of transactions between the two countries. More detailed information about currency swaps with the PBOC can be found at https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021210-print-pdf.ashx and https://thechinaguys.com/the-rise-of-the-renminbi-the-reality-of-bilateral-swap-agreements/ and https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2017/pdf/17-25a.pdf.  2. AidData treats drawdowns under BCS agreements with the PBOC as collateralized loans because, in a BCS arrangement, the currency of the borrower is held as collateral while the lender receives interest on the amount drawn down by the borrower until repayment is made.  3. AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate by adding 4% to the average 6-month SHIBOR rate (7.2864%) in 2016.  4. Multiple sources indicate that BCRA fully utilized the RMB 70 billion ($11 billion) bilateral currency swap with the PBOC in 2014 and 2015 According to a IMF Country Report No. 16/346, “[a]s of end-August [2016], gross reserves were US$31.2 billion amounting to 5.4 months of import cover or 71 percent of the IMF’s reserve adequacy metric. A large part of the reserves (US$11 billion) is from a renminbi swap line with China.” El Cronista, a local media outlet in Argentina, reports (see https://www.cronista.com/finanzas-mercados/Renueva-hoy-el-Banco-Central-el-primer-tramo-del-swap-con-China-20151030-0037.html) that the RMB 70 billion was fully exhausted by BCRA by September 2015, which implies that RMB 55.8 billion was drawn down in calendar year 2015 (since RMB 14.2 billion was drawn down in 2014).  5. According to the IMF Country Report No. 16/69, “the government negotiated and activated a renminbi swap line with the People’s Bank of China, drawing a total of US$4.6 billion as of late April 2015.” The same report says that the Government borrowed $2.4 billion from the PBOC in 2014, which implies that $2.2 billion was borrowed between January 2015 and April 2015.  6. According to IMF Country Report No. 18/374, “[o]n December 17, [2018] gross reserves increased by US$8.7bn, reflecting the activation of the augmented BCRA swap with the People’s Bank of China. The augmentation, which was signed during the recent G20, brings the total amount of freely available resources under the swap to US$18.7 billion. Gross international reserves moved up to US$58.6 billion.”  7. For evidence that the BCRA can convert the RMB it receives from PBOC into U.S. dollars (USD), see pg. 9 of the BCRA's 2015 financial statements. See https://www.dropbox.com/s/13bbay8z0psekx3/i2015financialstatements.pdf?dl=0  8. The December 16, 2015 supplementary agreement can be accessed in its entirety via https://www.dropbox.com/s/lm13xl9qwxcdl5c/Supplementary%20Agreement%20regarding%20the%20Bilateral%20Currency%20Swap%20Agreement%20Between%20PBOC%20and%20BCRA.pdf?dl=0. 9. Most central banks publish their end-of-year outstanding PBOC swap debt, but only a few report detailed transaction-level data on drawdowns during the year. Therefore, if no information on drawings is available, AidData assumes that total drawdowns during the reporting period equal the amount outstanding at the end of the reporting period (and vice versa). Since the (de jure) maturities of PBOC swap drawings are 12 months or less, this creates a lower bound estimate for actual drawdowns under the PBOC swap line.10. PBOC swap debt is frequently rolled over. In central bank reports where one can only observe the year-end outstanding amount, no distinction between rollovers and drawdowns is possible. In these cases, one can derive (new) drawdowns as the difference between the current and last year’s outstanding swap debt stock. This measure essentially captures net lending through the PBOC swap line.","# Sector

However, Argentina’s Congress did not approve the proposal until March 3, 2015 (via la Ley N° 27.123). Then, on February 15, 2016, the Chinese Government and Government of Argentina signed an agreement that allows the Chinese Government to build a ground station in western Argentina for scientific research purposes. The project represented a $50 million commitment, but the nature of the flow type is unknown.   The stated purpose of building the ground station (known as the Espacio Lejano Station) within Loncopué Department and Neuquén Province was to promote scientific research. According to Jorge Sapag, the former governor of Neuquén Province, the project would also promote scientific tourism through the construction of an on-site educational center and create 400 jobs and boost the development of the local economy, technology and education. China Harbor Engineering Corporation (CHEC) was the contractor responsible for construction of the ground station. It hired ESUCO S.A. as a subcontractor.

Then, at end of April 2016, Chinese and Argentine officials announced that the station will be fully operational in March 2017. By early 2017, satellite imagery suggests that most of the buildings at the ground station were structurally complete. At least 300 Argentine construction workers assisted on the site, according to Argentina's space agency (CONAE), before the project was handed over to Chinese management. Today, there are 30 Chinese staff members who work and live at the station.

The center is now built -- behind the 8-foot barbed wire fence that surrounds the entire space station compound. Visits are by appointment only.   Shrouded in secrecy, the compound has stirred unease among local residents, fueled conspiracy theories and sparked concerns within the U.S. Government about its true purpose, according to interviews with dozens of residents, current and former Argentine government officials, U.S. officials, satellite and astronomy specialists and legal experts. The station’s stated aim is peaceful space observation and exploration and, according to Chinese media, it played a key role in China’s landing of a spacecraft on the dark side of the moon in January.

President Mauricio Macri’s former foreign minister, Susana Malcorra, said in an interview with Reuters that Argentina has no physical oversight of the station’s operations. In 2016, she revised the China space station deal to include a stipulation it be for civilian use only. The agreement obliges China to inform Argentina of its activities at the station but provides no enforcement mechanism for authorities to ensure it is not being used for military purposes. When Argentina’s Congress debated the space station in 2015, during the presidency of Cristina Fernandez, opposition lawmakers questioned why there was no stipulation that it only be for civilian use. Nonetheless, Congress approved the deal. Then, when Macri took office in 2015, he was worried the space station agreement did not explicitly say it should be for civilian use only. Malcorra flew to Beijing in 2016 to rework it.
