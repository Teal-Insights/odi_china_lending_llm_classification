The agro-industrial complex uses modern biotechnology to deeply process the grains of crops, produce irreplaceable amino acids (lysine, tryptophan, etc.), and further produce high-yield and high-tech balanced compound feed and biological activator. The complex consists of a lysine plant with an annual output of 50,000 tons, a tryptophan plant with an annual output of 5,000 tons, a high-tech balanced compound feed production plant with an annual output of 1 million tons, an oil crop processing plant with an annual output of 300,000 tons, 600,000-ton silos and grain depots with drying facilities, construction of a grain raw material production base with an annual output of 1 million tons, supporting infrastructure projects, and on-site pipe networks.","# Sector

# Title
China Eximbank provides RMB 1.75 billion government concessional loan for Phase 1 of the Agro-Industrial Complex Project (Linked to Project ID#66526 and #67382)

# Description
On February 11, 2018, the Export-Import Bank of China and Belagroprombank — a state-owned bank in Belarus — signed two loan agreements for Phase 1 of the Agro-Industrial Complex Project: an RMB 1.75 billion government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL No. (2017) 36 TOTAL NO. (641)] and a $50 million buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement. The GCL, which is captured via Project ID#66525, carries a 15-year maturity and an interest rate of 2%. The borrowing terms of the BCL, which is captured via Project ID#67382, are unknown. Then, on June 11, 2018, China Eximbank and Belagroprombank signed an RMB 2.54 billion government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL No. (2017) 37 TOTAL NO. (642)] for Phase 2 of the Agro-Industrial Complex Project. The second GCL, which is captured via Project ID#66526, carries a 15-year maturity and an interest rate of 2%. Belagroprombank on-lent the proceeds from the GCLs and the BCL to a special purpose vehicle (SPV) called CJSC Belarusian National Biotechnology Corporation (BNBC). The proceeds from the GCLs and the BCL were to be used by the ultimate borrower, BNBC, to finance a three-year, $853.19 million (RMB 4.29 billion) engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract between CITIC Construction Co., Ltd. and BNBC, which was signed on November 26, 2016. The loans appears to be secured by (i.e. collateralized against) cash deposits in escrow accounts (or so-called ‘special accounts’). In November 2021, the Government of Belarus transferred responsibility for the  'special accounts' from Belagroprombank to Belarusbank. The project involved the construction of a new amino acid plant, a high-tech balanced compound feed production plant, a grain silo project with drying facilities, a combined heat and power station, and supporting infrastructure (such as railways, highways, natural gas pipelines, and transmission lines) in Pukhovichi District within Minsk Oblast. Upon completion, the agro-industrial complex is expected to process 250,000 tons of grain (wheat/triticale) per year and produce 64,700 tons of lysine, 5,900 tons of L-threonine, 1,300 tons of L-tryptophan, 23,000 tons of gluten, 99,000 tons of lysine-containing feed, 15,000 tons of ammonium sulfate crystals, and 10,000 tons of liquid ammonium sulfate. The project was also expected meet the future needs of cattle breeders for ‘essential amino acids.’ Its products will be sold domestically and abroad. CITIC Construction Co., Ltd. is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Construction commenced on July 27, 2018 and was originally expected to last for 36 months (estimated end date: July 27, 2021). On March 26, 2019, a formal groundbreaking ceremony for the Belarusian agro-industrial complex project took place. By end of 2020, the project had achieved a 73% completion rate. On October 31, 2021, CITIC Construction Co., Ltd.  produced the first batch of lysine sulfate. Then, on November 8, 2021, CITIC Construction Co., Ltd. produced the first batch of first wheat gluten. Then, on December 21, 2021, CITIC Construction Co., Ltd. produced the first batch of threonine. The construction of all Phase 1 and Phase 2 facilities was completed in December 2021 and all facilities were put into operation in November 2022. On August 6, 2020, CITIC Construction Co., Ltd. and BNBC signed a $547 million (RMB 3.8 billion) general EPC contract for Phase 3 of the Agro-Industrial Complex Project. A Phase 3 feasibility study was subsequently completed and Phase 2 was approved by a Government of Belarus Commission for Foreign Exchange and Credit. Then, on November 5, 2021,  CITIC Construction Co., Ltd. and BNBC signed a revised EPC contract for Phase 3 of the Agro-Industrial Complex Project worth RMB 4.8 billion.
