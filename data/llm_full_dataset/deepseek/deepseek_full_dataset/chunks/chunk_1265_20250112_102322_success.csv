SOMINA is the registered holder of the mining license for the Azelik Uranium Mine granted by the Government of Niger on November 8, 2007 for a period of 20 years covering a mining area of 220 square kilometers. On June 23, 2009, China Eximbank and SOMINA signed a $142,000,000 buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement for the Azelik Uranium Mine Project (captured via Project ID#91977). Under the terms of the BCL agreement, Somina was required to repay the loan in 11 installments, and pay interest on a quarterly basis. The loan was backed by a Sinosure credit insurance policy. It was also collateralized against equipment and vehicles owned by SOMINA and CNNC International Limited’s 37.2% equity stake in Somina. The outstanding principal of the GCL was approximately $90,880,000 on October 30, 2014, $78,100,000 on June 30, 2015, on $78,100,000 on August 19, 2015. Approximately three months earlier, on March 17, 2009, the Chinese Government and the Government of Niger signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the Azelik Uranium Mine Project. Then, in April 2011, China Eximbank and Société du Patrimoine des Mines du Niger (SOPAMIN) -- a Nigerian public holding company that manages the Government of Niger’s holdings in mining companies operating in the country — signed an RMB 650 million ($103 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Azelik Uranium Mine Project (captured via Project ID#256). The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate.   The proceeds of the loan were on-lent to SOMINA and used to finance the Government of Niger's 33% ownership stake in SOMINA.  The loan proceeds were also used by SOMINA to partially finance a $139.92 million commercial contract between Sinohydro Corporation Limited and China National Nuclear Corporation (CNCC), which was signed on March 31, 2008. Then, on August 24, 2009, SOMINA, as seller, and China Nuclear Energy Industry Corporation (中國原子能工業有限公司) (CNEIC),  as purchaser, entered into a Long-term Sales Contract. Under the terms of the Long-term Sales Contract, SOMINA agreed to sell and CNEIC agreed to purchase all uranium ore concentrates produced by SOMINA for a term ending on December 31, 2022. The purpose of the Azelik Uranium Mine Project was to develop the Teguidda mine at the Azelik uranium deposit. In addition to the development of the uranium mine, this project supported the construction of two coal-fired power plants and a hydrometallurgy plant.    China Nuclear International Uranium Corporation was responsible for the design of the project, and Sinohydro Corporation Limited was responsible for the implementation of the project. Trial operations of the mine began on December 10, 2010, with the first barrel of yellow cake uranium being produced on December 30, 2010. The mine officially started operations on March 17, 2011 and it reached a maximum capacity of 700 tons per year in 2012. However, mine production was suspended in mid-February 2015 due to cash flow problems. SOMINA reported at the time that its cash flow problems were the result of multiple factors, include the low and declining international price of uranium, delays in certain construction works related to the uranium mine, delays in the granting of a ‘favorable’ loan to SOMINA by the Government of Niger due to a military coup in Niger in 2010, and certain production process difficulties. In August 2015, SONIMA informed its shareholders that it extended a settlement with the local workforce for a temporary redundancy arrangement in compliance with the Niger labour law, until the end of August 2015. At that time, the mine was under temporary suspension and its production was expected to resume as soon as SOMINA’s cash flow position improved. However, as of 2021, mine production had still not resumed. SOMINA also faced criticism and pressure related to local protests over the lack of employment of local ethnic groups. low wages, and environmental degradation. This project also encountered a series of debt repayment problems.   On January 11, 2014, Focus International Development Corporation (FIDC) — a wholly-owned subsidiary of CNNC International Limited — and SOMINA signed a $4,500,000 bridge loan agreement with a 1-year maturity and an annual interest rate of 5.8% (captured via Project ID#91979).  As of the bridge loan’s final maturity date (December 31, 2014), the loan’s outstanding principal and interest were $4,343,257.88 and $182,856.78, respectively. Then, on January 2, 2015, FIDC and SOMINA signed a second bridge loan agreement worth $9,135,096.40 with a 2-year maturity and an annual interest rate of 7.8% (or the Hong Kong Dollar Best Lending Rate plus a 0.8% margin). The proceeds of the loan (captured via Project ID#91980) were to be used to refinance the accounts payable by SOMINA to CNNC (including the outstanding amount under the January 11, 2014 loan from FIDC), such that CNNC was not required to advance any new monies to SOMINA.    Also, in October 2014, SOMINA asked China Eximbank for an extension of the deadline for a $12,780,000 BCL (principal) repayment installment that was due on October 31, 2014 (and interest payment of approximately $444,000 for the third quarter of 2014). By February 2015, SOMINA met this repayment obligation. However, due to its tight cash flow position, SOMINA was not able to repay on time the next BCL (principal) repayment installment of $12,780,000 that was due on April 30, 2015. The borrower asked the lender for a repayment extension, and as of June 30, 2015, China Eximbank had not made any demands for immediate repayment of all outstanding debt or taken enforcement actions related to CNNC International Limited’s pledged 37.2% equity stake in SOMINA (which China Eximbank was entitled to do under the original terms of the June 23, 2009 loan agreement).","1.

(中国石油尼日尔项目公司 or CNPC-NP or CNPCNP) — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of CNPC — and the Government of Niger signed a production sharing contract (PSC). The contract granted exclusive exploitation rights to CNPC Niger Petroleum S.A. for Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Agadem oil field (via Decree No. 2008-177/PRN/MME). Then, on November 28, 2011, the Government of Niger and CNPC Niger Petroleum S.A. signed an agreement (‘memorandum’) on the Niger Petroleum Road Project.  Under the terms of the agreement, CNPC Finance (HK) Limited issued an oil prepayment facility — also known as a pre-export finance (PXF) facility — worth approximately $203 million to CNPC Niger Petroleum S.A. to support the implementation of the Niger Petroleum Road Project. The facility is a loan that provides cash advances in exchange for future oil sales. It carries an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3.5% margin. However, its other borrowing terms (maturity, grace period, etc.) are unknown. The borrower is expected to repay the loan with the proceeds from oil sales derived from the June 2, 2008 production sharing contract (PSC). The proceeds of the loan are to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial (EPC) contract between CNPC Niger Petroleum S.A. and China Petroleum Engineering Co., Ltd (CPE).    The purpose of the project is to support the development of a 185 km road (also known as the ‘Unity Road’ and ‘Oil Road’) connecting Diffa to N'Guigimi and the country’s border with Chad. The project has two main components: the rehabilitation of a 130 km road segment from Diffa to N'Guigmi (known as RN 1) and the construction of a 55 km road segment from N'Guigmi to the country’s border with Chad. China Petroleum Engineering Co., Ltd (CPE) is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. A formal project commencement ceremony took place on July 3, 2012. At the ceremony, Niger’s President requested an expansion of the project scope to include the construction of 15 kilometers of urban roads and ancillary facilities in the two cities and towns of Diffa, N'Guigmi, and Mainé-Soroa. The request was approved, which resulted in additional project design work between July 2012 and November 2012. However, construction activities were suspended in February 2015 due to insecurity created by the jihadist group Boko Haram. Prior to the suspension of road works, CPE and its Chinese subcontractor — CNPC DAGANG Niger Engineering — had completed the 60 km Diffa-Kablewa section of the Petroleum Road. When construction finally resumed in October 2020, CPE made two Nigerien firms (EGBTP and MWazir) responsible for road construction. EGBTP was given responsibility for the Kindjandi-Kablewa-N'Guigmi section of the road and MWazir was given responsibility for a section of the road that connects N'Guigmi, Boula Birin and the Chad border. According to the Government of Niger's Aid Management Platform, the project’s originally expected implementation start date was May 1, 2013 and its originally expected completion date was December 31, 2015.","1.

The June 2, 2008 production sharing contract can be accessed in its entirety via https://www.dropbox.com/s/unte8cvls2wwgj1/Avenant%20Signe%20No3..pdf?dl=0. 5. The PSC equity arrangement was revised on August 23, 2013 such that CNPC Niger Petroleum S.A. has a 65% ownership stake, Taiwan’s China Petroleum Corporation (CPC) has a 20% ownership state, and the Government of Niger has a 15% ownership stake in the production sharing arrangement for the Agadem oil fields. 6. Some sources refer to the face value of the loan as EUR 152 million or CFA 99,801,900,000. This issue warrants further investigation. 7. A pre-export finance (PXF) facility is an arrangement in which a commodity (e.g. oil) producer gets up-front cash from a customer in return for a promise to repay the customer with that commodity (possibly at a discount) in the future. PXF funds may be advanced by a lender or syndicate of lenders to a commodity producer to assist the company in meeting either its working capital needs (for example, to cover the purchase of raw materials and costs associated with processing, storage and transport) or its capital investment needs (for example, investment in plant and machinery and other elements of infrastructure). PXF facilities are usually secured by  (1) an assignment of rights by the producer under an ‘offtake contract’ (i.e., a sale and purchase contract between the producer and a buyer of that producer of goods or commodities), and (2) a collection account charge over a bank account into which proceeds due to the producer from the buyer of the goods or commodities under the offtake contract are credited. There are two key documents in prepayment finance transactions: a contract providing for the advance payment by the offtaker to the producer for the purchase of goods/commodities (the 'Prepayment Contract'), and a loan agreement between a lender and the offtaker (the 'Offtaker Loan Agreement') under which the advance payment is financed. 8. AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate by adding 3.5% to average 6-month LIBOR in November 2011 (0.681%). 9. On November 28, 2011, Phase I of the Agadem upstream and downstream integrated project was completed and became operational. In the first few years following the completion of Phase I, Government of Niger revenues from the integrated oil project slightly exceeded $100 million annually. 10. There are some indications that CNPC may have issued one or more additional loans — via oil prepayment arrangements — to CNPC Niger Petroleum S.A.  for the first and/or second phase development of the Agadem oilfield project. According to the IMF’s Coordinated Direct Investment Survey, Niger owed FDI debt of $2.5 billion to Chinese residents in 2019 and $5 billion in 2020 (https://data.imf.org/regular.aspx?key=60564261).

CNPC holds a 60% ownership stake, and the Government of Niger holds a 40% ownership take in SORAZ. To finance Phase 1 of the Agadem Oil Project, CNPC borrowed $880 million from China Eximbank in 2008 on the following terms: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 350 basis points, a maturity of 11 years (estimated final maturity date: September 2, 2019), and a 1 year grace period.  CNPC then used the proceeds of this loan to on-lend to Société de Raffinage de Zinder (SORAZ).
