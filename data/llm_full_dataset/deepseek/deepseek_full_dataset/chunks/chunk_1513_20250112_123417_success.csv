This framework agreement (captured in Project ID#60219) was ratified on October 26, 2006.    Four of the subsidiary loans that were approved through the framework agreement supported Phase 1 of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project. They included an $85 million China Eximbank loan in 2007 for the Pointe Noire-Malélé Section of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project (captured in Project ID#68874), an $84 million China Eximbank loan for the Malélé-Les Saras Section of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project (captured in Project ID#72780), an $84 million China Eximbank loan in 2007 for Les Saras-Mvou Section of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project (captured in Project ID#72781), and a $74 million China Eximbank loan in 2007 for the Mvou-Dolisie Section of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project (captured in Project ID#72782).   The estimated borrowing terms of these loans are as follows: a 0.25% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, and a 5-year grace period.  The (principal) amount outstanding under these four loans was $57,483,425 as of December 31, 2019.    The Pointe Noire-Malélé Section of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project involved the construction of a 55 km road segment that runs from Pointe-Noire to Malélé. The Malélé-Les Saras Section of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project involved the construction of a 37 km road segment that runs from Malélé to Les Saras. The Les Saras-Mvou Section of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project involved the construction of a 36 km road segment that runs from Les Saras to Mvou (Mvouti). The Mvou-Dolisie Section of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project involved the construction of a 45 km road segment that runs from Mvou (Mvouti) to Dolisie.    China State Construction Engineering Corporation Ltd. was the contractor responsible for all four of these road sections. Phase 1 construction began in May 2008 and was opened to traffic in December 22, 2011. Phase 2 of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project, which was also financed by China Eximbank, involved the construction of the 375 km road from Dolisie to Brazzaville.

Phase 1 is also known as the Pointe Noire-Dolisie (RN1) Road Construction Project. The Chinese project title is 承建的刚果（布）一号公路一期工程 or 即中建总公司1号公路. 2. According to a 2019 report published by the Republic of Congo’s National Assembly, all loans approved under the June 19, 2006 framework agreement had an interest rate of 0.25%, maturities between 13 years and 20 years, and grace periods between 3 and 5 years. Therefore, since the actual maturities and grace periods of the four loans that supported Phase 1 of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project are unknown, AidData imputes a maturity value of 16.5 years (the middle of the distribution of the maturity range) as an approximation and a grace period value of 4 years (the middle of the grace period distribution) as an approximation. 3. In the database of Chinese loan commitments that SAIS-CARI released in July 2020, it identifies a single $552 million China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project.

To support these transactions, China Eximbank provided an export seller's credit (loan) to Yutong Bus Corporation ('Yutong'), which in turn used the proceeds of the loan to provide a supplier's credit to the Government of Cuba for the purchase of 1,998 energy-efficient Yutong buses.

In April 2010, the Government of Cuba requested that its outstanding debt (under the supplier's credit) be restructured. Yutong then filed an insurance claim with Sinosure in July 2010.  Sinosure made an initial indemnity payment (worth $14.27 million) to Yutong in March 2011 and another indemnity payment (worth $34.39 million) to Yutong in July 2011.
