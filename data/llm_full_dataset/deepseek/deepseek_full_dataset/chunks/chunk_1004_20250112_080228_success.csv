The borrowing terms of the facility are unknown. However, it is known that Sinosure provided credit insurance. The proceeds from the facility were used to finance an EPC (or EPCF) contract between HQCEC and KAR Group.   The purpose of the project was to expand the capacity of the Erbil Refinery (also known as the Kawrkosek Refinery), which is located in Khabat district, 40 km west of Erbil city, on a plot of land 2.5km² to the left of upper ZAB River. HQCEC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation.  The project was implemented between July 2014 and September 2016. Then, on May 1, 2022, a missile attack targeted the refinery and caused a fire in one of its main tanks, which was later brought under control. The attack came on the heels of a March 16, 2022 Iranian missile strike that destroyed the house of Baz Karim, the head of KAR Group.","1. This project is also known as the KAR Group Erbil Refinery No.4 Expansion Project, the KAR 4th Refinery Expansion Project, the Iraq KAR Refinery Phase-4 Extension Project, and the KAR4 Refinery Project. The Chinese project title is 在伊拉克库尔德地区炼油厂项目 or 的伊拉克KAR炼厂四期扩建项目. The Arabic project title is  مصفى الصينية.2. The accounts receivables financing facility is described as ‘ECA- backed’ by this source (https://www.dropbox.com/s/gd1bmwibacinhjm/Chai%20Jie%20-%20Tian%20Yuan%20Law%20Firm%20-%20Beijing%20-%20Lawyer%20profile%202021%20_%20China%20Business%20Law%20Journal.pdf?dl=0).  For the time being, AidData assumes that the ECA in question in China’s official export credit agency (ECA): China Eximbank. More likely than not, China Eximbank signed an accounts receivable transfer agreement with (HQCEC) to provide financing for the construction period of the project. In this type of arrangement, the exporter (seller) procures insurance from Sinosure and transfers its accounts receivable under the insurance policy to a bank. The bank then grants financing to the exporter (seller) and becomes the insured under the transferred insurance policy. When an insured loss occurs, Sinosure pays indemnity to the financing bank pursuant to the insurance policy and the Accounts Receivable Transfer Agreement. However, this issue requires further investigation. 3. One source refers to Standard Chartered Bank’s involvement in a ‘USD200 million receivables financing facility with China Huanqiu Contracting & Engineering Corp in relation to a refinery expansion project in Erbil, Iraq.’ This issue requires further investigation. 4. HQCEC is a subsidiary of CNPC. 5. This transaction won the 2015 Deal of Year (Project Finance) in the China Business Law Journal. 6. In a typical receivables financing agreement (or deferred payment agreement), the company that the project owner in the host country has selected as its engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor is also a lender to the project owner. The company assigns receivables under its EPC contract with the project owner to one of or more banks. Upon assignment of receivables, the bank or banks will release funds to the company so it can discharge its obligations under the receivables financing agreement  as a lender. Receivables financing is also known as accounts receivable financing (finance) or A/R financing (finance) or 应收账款融资 (in Chinese). These other terms are used because the accounts receivable of a company (i.e., unpaid invoices) are being used as collateral to unlock working capital—typically in the form of a bank loan (‘receivables loan’). Sellers often face cash flow problems when their buyers do not make full payment at the due date of the invoice. A receivables financing arrangement addresses this problem by allowing them to sell their outstanding invoices to a bank at a discounted rate. This approach allows the seller to receive the remaining invoice amount before the due date of the invoice. The bank either gets its money back at invoice maturity through the seller (acting as a collecting agent) or directly from the debtor.","# Sector

65483,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides buyer’s credit loan for Ashdod Port Southern Terminal Construction Project,"In June 2014, it was announced that Pan-Mediterranean Engineering Company (PMEC) -- a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of China Harbour Engineering Company - won a tender to build the Ashdod Port Southern Terminal (נמל הדרום) in Israel with a 3.35 billion NIS bid. The port, one of Israel's largest, was located in Ashdod, about 40 kilometers south of Tel Aviv, adjoining the mouth of the Lachish River. An Israeli state-owned enterprise (SOE), the Israel Ports & Assets Company Ltd., was responsible for overseeing the implementation of the project and eventually assuming responsibility for the property and assets constructed by PMEC.  The Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank) identifies this project on its website in a long list of other projects that it is financing with loans. However, it is not clear when China Eximbank issued a loan for this project. The face value, borrower, and borrowing terms of the loan are also unknown. China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) did issue buyer’s credit insurance for up to $948 million to the borrower. According to the Chinese Government, the monetary value of the commercial contract for the Ashdod Port Southern Terminal Construction Project was approximately $950 million (with a total contract period is 93 months).  The port was developed under a build, operate, and transfer (BOT) process as part of a 25-year concession. The port's eventual operator  was to complete the terminal development and then equip, operate, and maintain the port for the duration of the contract period. The project was divided into three subprojects: the breakwater project, the dredging project, and the wharf project. More specifically, the project involved the construction of a wharf with a total shoreline length of 2,363 meters project. It also involved the building of an 800-meter long main quay with a water depth of 17.3m, an extension of the port’s existing main breakwater by 600 meters, the building of 1,500 meters of secondary breakwaters, the dredging of the port, and the construction of storage and operating spaces.  Upon completion, it was expected that the southern terminal would the capacity to handle 1 to 2.16 million TEU (20-foot standard containers) annually. The facilities were built on reclaimed land, and were planned to handle Ultra Large Crude Carriers (ULCC) 18,000+ TEU vessels.  The port was one of the biggest investment projects in Israel, as well as one of the largest harbor construction projects contracted to a Chinese company. The southern terminal was to be Israel's first privatized port and was expected to connect Israel with international trade routes between Asia and Europe. 90% of Israeli international trade went through its seaports, but Israel lacked the capacity to handle the largest vessels; the new port was designed to accommodate these larger ships. Moreover, the new port was expected to be more competitive and efficient than Israel's existing state-controlled ports in Ashdod and Haifa. Overall, the port was expected to improve Israel's economic development and trade, as well as herald in a new era of Sino-Israeli cooperation. In addition to PMEC, China Communications Second Navigation Engineering Bureau Co., Ltd. was subcontracted to support the project implementation. Chinese state-owned construction machinery company Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group Co., Ltd. (XCMG) provided a 800t XGC800 crawler crane, as well as other construction equipment for hosting ripraps and Antifer-blocks (concrete blocks to guard against waves) for project implementation.  The cornerstone for the seaport was laid on October 28, 2014, in the presence of the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu. At the time, the port was expected to begin operations in 2021. Despite reports from Chinese sources that the project faced challenges in hydraulic engineering, the adoption of European, American, and Israeli standards, the local climate, the environmental impact, noise concerns from local residents, as well as its expansive scale. Nonetheless, CHEC-PMEC made good progress by innovating, including independently developing the world's first platform jackup rig specifically designed for offshore gravel pile construction. As of July 2019, the project was still expected to be completed in 2021. The port was still ongoing as of April 2021. However, in 2022, the main part of the reconstruction project of Pier 21 in Ashdod Port, Israel, undertaken by Pan-Mediterranean Engineering Company, was completed ahead of schedule and put into operation.  Dutch firm Terminal Investment Limited, a subsidiary of the Swiss firm Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), won the Israeli government tender to operate the Ashdod’s Southern Terminal for 25 years following the completion of its construction.","1.
