1471,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides $403.7 million buyer’s credit loan for Addis Ababa Light Rail Project (Linked to Project ID#69476),"On June 22, 2011, China Eximbank and the Ethiopian Railways Corporation (ERC) — an Ethiopian state-owned enterprise — signed a $403,750,000.(ETB 7,347,972,973) buyer’s credit loan agreement for the Addis Ababa Light Rail Project. The borrowing terms of the loan (PBC) were as follows: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.6% margin, a 3 year grace period, and a 23 year maturity. The Government of Ethiopia provided a sovereign guarantee for the loan.   The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a $475 million commercial contract [ID# ET/ERC/CREC/0901] between the ERC and China Railway Group Limited (CREC), which was signed on September 3, 2009. The ERC was responsible for directly funding the remaining 15% of the commercial contract cost ($71,250,000). Its direct contribution was payable in ETB as a down payment (with exchange rate applicable to the base date.   According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), this loan achieved a 42% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 6 loan disbursements (worth ETB 3,097,176.899) between 2014 and 2016: an ETB 327,586,207 disbursement on January 8, 2014, an ETB 905,511,811 disbursement on July 8, 2014, an ETB 680,000,000 disbursement on October 8, 2014, an ETB 989,898,990 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 544,700 disbursement on October 7, 2015, and an ETB 193,635,191 disbursement on April 7, 2016.   The Addis Ababa light rail metro system is a 31.6 km electrified light rail transportation system with two lines: a 17.4 kilometer east-west line and a 16.9 kilometer north-south line. The east-west line stretches from Ayat village to Tor Hailoch passing through Megenagna, Legehar and Mexico Square The north-south line passes through Menelik II Square, Merkato, Lideta, Leghar, Meskel Square, Gotera and Kaliti. The light rail metro system was designed to facilitate transportation in a city of 5 million clogged with other forms of transportation.  Each train was planned have a capacity to carry 286 passengers for a maximum capacity of 300,000 passengers/day. CREC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation.   The EPC contract identifies January 31, 2012 as the expected project commencement date and January 30, 2015 as the expected project completion date. It also identifies a defects liability period of one year. The project site was ultimately handed over to the EPC contractor on January 31, 2012. However, construction did not begin until April 2013. Trial operation of the railway began on February 1, 2015. The north-south line commenced operations on September 20, 2015, and the east-west line commenced operations on November 9, 2015.    According to official figures, the rail system carried on average 105,000-110,000 daily passengers during its first 14 months of operations. Tickets initially cost two to six birr ($0.08 to $0.20), depending on the distance of the trip. ERC earned $5 million in revenue from the light rail line during the Ethiopian Fiscal Year 2016/17, and by January 2017, the rail system had carried over 50 million customers. The rail system was initially supposed to be run by the Shenzhen Metro Group and CRECG until 2020. However, in 2018, the ERC was prepared to take over the operation of the railway from CRECG.   Since then, the railway has faced an array of operational performance and revenue generation problems. The Addis Ababa light rail metro system initially began operating with 40 trains, but as of 2021, it was regularly operating with approximately 20 trains. Addis Ababa’s deputy mayor has also noted that the city’s electrical grid lacked the capacity to power the system before construction began. Even with its own dedicated power supply, the Addis Ababa light rail metro system still experiences power outages and delays, leading to packed cars and poor service. Additionally, in 2021, Ethiopia’s Office of the Auditor General found that, during its first four years in operation, the Addis Ababa light rail metro system generated $11.1 million of revenue but cost $154 million to operate. It found that the system was falling far short of its original feasibility study, which said it would pay for its construction costs within 10 years through ticket sales, advertising and renting out spaces in stations, among other methods: '[t]he feasibility study has been inadequate, and it was conducted without collecting enough information. […] This, coupled with the absence of a maintenance center to fix the trains that need repair and other factors, have contributed to the losses sustained by the light railway.'

COMPLANT was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation.   Construction began in May 2012 and ended on November 30, 2014.  Irrigable land reached 2,946 hectares while the construction of 20.5 kilometers of main canal was completed. Then, in March 2015, the factory underwent a trial run. Factory operations began in 2016. However, according to the AMP, the project had only achieved a 99.05% completion rate as of April 2022. Currently, the sugar factory has 8,413 hectares of land covered with cane among which 6,000 hectares cultivated by a private company known as Amibara Agricultural Development (with which ESC has signed contractual agreement). Kessem Sugar Factory is capable of producing 260,000 tons of sugar and 30,000 cube meters of ethanol per year at maximum capacity.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank and CDBs loan for the Kessem Sugar Factory Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lenders. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges.
