95554,ACTION RELATING TO DEBT,China Eximbank suspends debt service payments from Government of Guinea in 2020,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting that took place on April 15, 2020 and on November 13, 2020, the Chinese Government agreed to work with other G20 members to implement the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). As part of DSSI, China Eximbank and the Government of Guinea signed a debt suspension agreement during calendar year 2020 (most likely between May 2020 and July 2020). Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between May 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under one or more loan agreements. The total estimated suspension amount is $3.9 million. However, at the time that the parties signed the debt suspension agreement, they both acknowledged that the total suspension amount would ultimately be determined at the end of the suspension period (since loan disbursements could be made during the suspension period and the lender agreed to suspend the payment of interest accrued on any disbursements during the suspension period). The lender and borrower agreed that the suspension of debt service would be undertaken on a net present value (NPV)-neutral basis. Therefore, the borrower agreed to pay interest accrued on the amount outstanding under the total suspension amount (‘Suspension Interest’) by paying the Suspension Interest on the amount outstanding under each loan agreement’s suspension amount at the same rate of interest set forth in the original loan agreement. The lender and the borrower agreed that the repayment of the suspension amount for each loan agreement would take place in equal, successive, and semi-annual installments during a 3-year repayment period after a 1-year grace period (starting from and including the repayment date/repayment date of principal and interest falling within the suspension period). Additionally, under the terms of the debt suspension agreement, the lender and the borrower agreed that ‘[t]he suspension interest on the amount outstanding under the Suspension Amount concerning each Loan Agreement shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and a year of 360 days, from and including the Repayment Date/Repayment Date of Principal and Interest falling within the Suspension Period to the date of payment in full of the corresponding Suspension Amount, and shall be paid in arrears on each Interest Payment Date under the corresponding Loan Agreement.’ The borrower also agreed that (1) ‘it shall continue to perform all its obligations […] under the Loan Agreements as supplemented and amended by [the debt suspension agreement]’; (2) ‘it shall use the created fiscal space to increase social, health, or economic spending in response to the COVID-19 crisis […]’ and ‘work closely with the International Financial Institutions who are expected to put in place a monitoring system’;  (3) ‘it shall disclose to the Lender all Public Sector Financial Commitments (as defined in the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 (GFSM2014)), respecting commercially sensitive information’; and (4) ‘it shall contract no new non-concessional debt during the Suspension Period, other than agreements under the DSSI’.",1. AidData assumes that the same basic terms and conditions that governed China Eximbank’s DSSI (debt suspension) agreement with other governments also applied to its DSSI agreement that it signed with the Government of Guinea.

In 2020, China Development Bank (CDB) subsequently issued an $830 million loan to Amaria Hydraulic & Electrical Development Corporation SAU for the 300 MW Amaria Hydropower Plant Construction Project. The estimated borrowing terms of the loan are as follows: a 15-year maturity and a 6% interest rate. The loan is reportedly backed by a Sinosure credit insurance policy and collateralized against a $30 million minimum cash balance in a debt service reserve account (DSRA) prior to the commissioning of the power plant. The borrower (Amaria Hydraulic & Electrical Development Corporation SAU) also signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the state-owned power utility, Electricité de Guinée (EDG), and the Government of Guinea guaranteed the power purchase payments under the PPA.    The total cost of the independent power plant (IPP) project is $1,154,030,000. It is being built on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 82:18.   The purpose of the project is to construct a 300 MW hydroelectric power plant that is located downstream along the Konkoure River. The power plant is expected to provide power for a 30 metric tons per year bauxite mine and an aluminum smelter. TBEA is the contractor responsible for project implementation. Civil works commenced on January 19, 2018.  The project was originally expected to reach completion within 56 months (September 19, 2022) and create 10,000 direct jobs.
