Additionally, the Chinese government agreed to send a technical team to help with installation and readjustment of the machines, and transport them to the Port of Guayaquil.   The scanners were to be installed and operate in Guayaquil and Puerto Bolívar, and were to benefit the National Customs Service of Ecuador (SENAE). The scanners were produced by NUCTECH.  The project cost was 42 million RMB, according to the Letters (equivalent to 6,433,200 USD), which would be provided through the Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreements (ETCA) that were signed November 20, 2007; November 24, 2009; and November 17, 2010 (see projects #88148, #35844, and #88177).

The handover certificate was signed on 18 March 2013.","Potential ranges of the amounts pulled from each ETCA grant are all calculated by subtracting the maximum amounts available from the other two agreement from 42 million RMB for the lower bound, and using the maximum amount available as the upper bound. For example, the range for the November 24, 2009 ETCA is between 3.45 million RMB and 10 million RMB because, (1) regarding the upper bound, there is no evidence of other sub-projects that it funded, indicating up to the full amount could have gone towards this project and (2) regarding the lower bound, up to 20 million RMB from the November 17, 2010 ETCA + up to 18.55 million RMB available from the November 20, 2007 ETCA (see project #88148, calculated by 20 million - 1.45 million - some unknown additional amount) = 38.55 million RMB. 42 million - 38.55 million = 3.45 million RMB at minimum.","# Sector
