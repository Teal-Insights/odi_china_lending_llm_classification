53116,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,China Eximbank provides RMB 1 billion government concessional loan for Phase 2 of Kribi Deep Sea Port Project (Linked to Project ID#53396 and #350),"On January 19, 2016, China Eximbank expressed its willingness to finance Phase 2 of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project. Then, on April 5, 2017, China Eximbank formally issued a $675.5 million ‘mixed credit’ to the Government of the Republic of Cameroon for Phase 2. It provided an RMB 1 billion government concessional loan (GCL) (captured via Project ID#53116) and a $524,579,992 preferential buyer's credit (PBC) loan (captured via Project ID#53396).   The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 2% interest rate, and a 7 year grace period. The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 22 year maturity, a 2% interest rate, and a 11 year grace period. Both loans were secured by (i.e. collateralized against) the revenues of the Autonomous Port of Kribi, which were to be deposited by the borrower into an escrow account (known as the ‘Control Account’).  The proceeds of the GCL and the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract between China Harbour Engineering Company Limited and Cameroon's Ministry of Economy, Planning and Regional Development (MINEPAT).   As of December 31, 2020, the GCL had achieved a 21.1% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 64.9 billion) and its amount outstanding was equivalent to CFA 17.3 billion. As of December 31, 2020, the PBC had achieved a 25.6% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 200.9 billion) and its amount outstanding was equivalent to CFA 31.4 billion.   Phase 2 involved the construction of a 1,102m long quay, the expansion of the container terminal from 700m to 1,050m, and the addition of both an ore and oil terminal.   China Harbour Engineering Company Limited was the contractor responsible for implementation. Phase 2 was completed on March 2, 2018.  China Eximbank also supported the Phase 1 of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project (as captured via Project ID#350).  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the first and second phases of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding.

53234,ENERGY,Bank of China provides $123.25 million loan for Phase 2 of Solar Rural Electrification Project (Linked to Project ID#57697),"On September 26, 2012, Huawei and Cameroon’s Ministry of Water Resources and Energy signed a memorandum of understanding regarding a $400 million project to deploy the Huawei PowerCube5000 micro-grid solution to convert solar energy into electric energy. Then, in February 2015, Cameroonian President Paul Biya issued a presidential decree authorizing the Minister of Economy, Planning and Territorial Rehabilitation to sign a $90.1 million financing (supplier credit) agreement with Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. for the PowerCube5000 Micro-Grid Solution Project. The borrowing terms of the supplier credit are unknown. It is also unclear if the supplier credit agreement was ever finalized.  However, it is known that Bank of China and the Government of Cameroon signed a $90.1 million buyer’s credit loan agreement for Phase 1 of the Solar Rural Electrification Project on February 1, 2015, and Bank of China and the Government of Cameroon signed a $123,250,000 loan agreement for Phase 2 of the Solar Rural Electrification Project on September 1, 2017. The Bank of China loan for Phase 1 carried a 13 year maturity, 4 year grace period, and 4.2% interest rate. As of December 31, 2020, the loan for Phase 1 had achieved a 91.4% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 4.2 billion) and its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 31.4 billion.   The Bank of China loan for Phase 2 carried a 12 year maturity, 3 year grace period, and 5% interest rate. As of December 31, 2020, the loan for Phase 2 had achieved a 100% disbursement rate and its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 59.5 billion. Project ID#53117 captures the supplier credit that Huawei offered to the Government of Cameroon in 2015.   Project ID#57697 captures the buyer’s credit loan from Bank of China for Phase 1 of the Solar Rural Electrification Project. Project ID#53234 captures the loan from Bank of China for Phase 2 of the Solar Rural Electrification Project.   The purpose of the Solar Rural Electrification Project was to supply, install and operate photovoltaic infrastructure (known as solar mini-grids or solar micro-grids) in 350 localities (villages and towns) in Cameroon. The project, which was implemented in two phases, sought to cover 58 states within 10 major regions across the country and deliver 70MW of solar energy to 150,000 people across 1,000 sites and 350 localities. Phase 1 targeted 166 localities and Phase 2 targeted 184 localities. It was originally envisaged that villagers would pay less than FCFA 100 for a kilowatt of power once the project was fully operational.   Huawei was the contractor responsible for the implementation of both phases of the project. Phase 1 officially commenced on November 29, 2016. Huawei reportedly installed a number of solar-backed micro-grid systems across the country in 2017, with systems ranging from 30 kW to 300 kW in size, featuring advanced maximum power point tracker (MPPT) technology, high-efficiency inverters, and advanced charging-discharging management. Phase 1 ultimately delivered 11.2MW of solar energy to 166 localities (villages and towns) and it reportedly benefited between 13,984 and 22,240 households (including 3,100 households that secured electricity connections in 2021). These localities received electricity from a solar power plant in the village of Nsem, which was officially commissioned in November 24, 2018. However, the first phase of the project was plagued by accusations of corruption and embezzlement. As of late 2021, Phase 1 was not yet complete. However, the management of all photovoltaic infrastructure that was installed during Phase 1 was handed over to Cameroon’s Rural Electrification Agency in February 2021.   Phase 2 commenced in 2018, and as of December 14, 2018, it had achieved a 31% completion rate. As of late 2021, all Phase 2 construction activities were complete and 9,820 household electricity connections had been established (including 3,946 in 2021), but the Phase 2 campaign to increase the number of households with electricity connections was still underway and efforts to transfer management of all photovoltaic infrastructure installed during Phase 2 to Cameroon’s Rural Electrification Agency were ongoing. In November 2020, the Government of Cameroon announced plans to pursue a third phase of the project, which would seek to reach an additional 200 localities (villages and towns).  There are some indications that the Bank of China loans for the first and second phases of the Solar Rural Electrification Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.

Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding.

57586,ENERGY,China Eximbank provides $141.8 million buyer’s credit loan for Phase 2 of 211 MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project (Linked to Project ID#289),"On February 28, 2017, China Eximbank signed an a buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement with Cameroon's Ministry of Power and Water Resources worth $141,839,830 for Phase 2 of the 211 MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. The borrowing terms of the BCL are as follows: a 15 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 320 basis points. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the BCL to partially finance the cost of a commercial contract between Cameroon’s Ministry of Water and Energy and Sinohydro Corporation. As of December 31, 2020, the loan (BCL) had achieved a 90.9% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 6.9 billion) and the its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 69.1 billion.   The purpose of the project is to evacuate 211MW of electricity from the Memve'ele dam (on River Ntem) to Yaounde. The project scope includes (1) the construction of 294 pylons between Nyabizan and Ebolowa; (2) the installation of a 225kV, 280 km electricity transmission line between Nyabissan (Memve'ele), Ebolowa and Ahala substations; (3) deviation of the existing 225kV Mangombé-Oyomabang single-circuit electricity transmission line and the existing 90kV Edéa-Yaoundé single-circuit electricity transmission line; (4) the construction of two new Ebolowa and Nkol Nkumu 225kV substations; and (5) extension of the existing Ahala substation from 90kV to 225kV. Upon completion, these transmission lines to Ebolowa and substations are expected to connect the dam to Cameroon’s southern network and to Yaoundé. Sinohydro 16th Bureau is the contractor responsible for project implementation. The project construction began in 2011 and the dam was completed since June 2017, but energy evacuation works are being built and it is expected to be announced in August 2020.  As of September 30, 2021, the construction of the Nyabizan-Yaoundé evacuation line had achieved a 92% completion rate (and at least 280 of the 294 pylons were installed). However, the completion of the project (commissioning of the dam) depends on payment of compensation to the people affected by the transmission line’s corridor.  The people located along a 5 km route of this 270 km line are claiming nearly FCFA 3 billion (EUR 5 million) in compensation, and as of December 2021, this issue had not been resolved (after several failed attempts and deadlines). In late June 2021, during a special plenary session of the National Assembly, Cameroon’s Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Essomba provided an update on the status of the project. He explained that “Memve’ele hydroelectric plant is already injecting 90MW of energy into the South Interconnected Network” and “once the 225kV line is completed […] the volume of production injected will rise to 211 MW.” However, according to Sinohydro 16th Bureau, the hydroelectric power plant will not operate at full capacity after the completion of the 280 km electricity transmission line between Nyabizan and Ebolowa because of the flow of the Ntem River.  The company’s experts believe claim that the flow of the Ntem River will not be sufficient to regularly drive the power plant’s four (52.75 MW) turbines.   The solution suggested by Sinohydro 16th Bureau is the construction of a reservoir and the project is reportedly being ‘fine-tuned’ to address this issue. According to the Government of Cameroon, the revenue generated by the Memve’ele hydroelectric power plant and Nyabizan-Yaoundé transmission line since ‘powering up’ from April 2019 to October 2021 amounts to CFAF 45 billion. In addition, the partial completion of the 211MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project enabled the shutdown of the Ahala, Oyom-Abang, Mbalmayo and Ebolowa thermal power stations, which has led to a substantial reduction in the fuel costs that were previously borne by the Government of Cameroon. Phase 1 of the project was also financed by China Eximbank in 2012 and completed in 2016 (as captured via Project ID#289).
