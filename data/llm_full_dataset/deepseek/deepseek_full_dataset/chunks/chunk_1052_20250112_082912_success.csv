Reuters reports that PDVSA paid off a $1.5 billion loan that it received in 2014 in December 2017, but it does not identify the source of the loan. This source may or may not be referring to the CDB loan that was issued in December 2014.  This issue merits further investigation.  2. AidData assumes that the credit facility was fully drawn down by the borrower (based on Reuters reporting). Therefore, Project ID#58504 is not assigned to the umbrella category.  3. Given that the borrower was allowed to repay the loan with the delivery of crude oil and related products at market prices, AidData assumes for the time being that the loan is collateralized with oil export revenue. However, this issue requires further investigation. 4. The China-Latin America Finance Database, which is co-produced by the Inter-American Dialogue and Boston University’s Global Development Policy Center, does not capture this $1.5 billion loan from China Development Bank.","# Sector
