Facing an acute balance of payment crisis, the Government of Seychelles put in place a comprehensive debt restructuring program to reduce sovereign debt as a percentage of GDP to 50% by 2020. Part of this program involved an agreement in April 2009 with the Paris Club to restructure $160 million in bilateral debt. Paris Club creditors agreed to a nominal debt stock cancellation of 45%, with the remaining amounts rescheduled over 18 years, including a 5-year grace period. The restructuring agreement with the Paris Club also called upon the Government of Seychelles to restructure its outstanding obligations to other bilateral creditors and private creditors (who accounted for the majority of external debt).
