It deferred principal and interest payments for 12 months –- providing $416.8 million of cash flow relief –- on a $2 billion oil-backed loan (facility) that CDB issued to Ecuador's Ministry of Finance on April 29, 2016. The $2 billion loan consists of two tranches: a $1.5 billion tranche known as Tranche A (captured via Project ID#58839) and an RMB 3,255,000,000 (approximately $500 million) tranche known as Tranche B (captured via Project ID#58842). Under Tranches A and B, the Government of Ecuador was originally scheduled to pay $166.8 million through the end of 2020 (in two installments) and $250 million from January 2021 to July 2021 (in three installments). However, under the rescheduling agreement, the Government of Ecuador agreed to pay the $416.8 million in 11 quarterly installments (of $37.9 million each) from the last quarter of 2021 (on October 29, 2021) until the second quarter of 2024 (on April 29, 2023). In effect, the borrower was given one additional year of grace on Tranche A and Tranche B.   According to Ecuador's Ministry of Economy and Finance, the interest rates on Tranche A and Tranche B remained unchanged under the August 5, 2020 rescheduling agreement. According to Ecuador's Ministry of Finance, the August 5, 2020 agreement also rescheduled oil deliveries from PetroEcuador to UNIPEC Asia Co. Ltd. and PetroChina International. These oil deliveries support the CDB loan in that the proceeds from the sale of oil serve as a source of debt service and collateral. The updated delivery schedule is unknown. However, it is known that the parties agreed to postpone the shipment and sale of 108 million barrels of oil to Chinese buyers, thereby giving Petroecuador the flexibility to sell its oil to other buyers. The August 5, 2020 reschedulings of Tranche A and Tranche B are captured via Project ID#91347 and Project ID#96374, respectively.   Then, on September 19, 2022, CDB and the Government of Ecuador signed another agreement to reschedule $1.395 billion of outstanding debt under Tranches A and B of the $2 billion oil-backed loan that was issued on April 29, 2016 and under Tranches A and B of a $900 million oil-backed loan (with a $675 million tranche known as Tranche A and a RMB 1.53 billion tranche known as Tranche B) that was issued on December 20, 2018 (captured via Project ID#59014 and #59015). Under the terms of the September 19, 2022 rescheduling agreement, the parties agreed to 3-year maturity extensions and interest rate reductions for Tranches A and B of the $2 billion loan and Tranches A and B of the $900 million loan. The parties agreed to reduce the interest rate that applies to Tranche A of the $2 billion loan from 7.25% to 6.3%, reduce the interest rate that applies to Tranche B of the $2 billion loan from 6.8717% to 5.9%, reduce the interest rate that applies to Tranche A of the $900 million loan from 6.6% to 6.3%, and reduce the interest rate that applies to Tranche B of the $900 million loan from 6.2% to 5.9%. The parties also agreed to extend the final maturity dates of Tranches A and B under the $2 billion loan from April 29, 2024 to April 29, 2027, and extend the final maturity dates of Tranches A and B under the $900 million loan from December 12, 2024 to December 12, 2027.

The Government of Ecuador and China Eximbank also rescheduled multiple loans on September 19, 2022, and the rescheduling agreements with China Eximbank and CDB jointly produced cash flow savings worth $1.4 billion. The September 2022 deal reduced repayments to CDB by $745 million over a 3-year period (2022-2024) and reduced repayments to China Eximbank by $680 million over a 4-year period (2022-2025). Another feature of the deal is that it postponed the shipment and sale oil to CNPC, thereby giving Petroecuador the flexibility to sell more of its oil to other buyers at market prices.","1. The press release from Ecuador's Ministry of Finance from August 8, 2020 regarding this debt rescheduling reports that the interest rate will be the same as the interest rate on the original loan, 7.16%. However, the two tranches of the loan being rescheduled have 7.25% and 6.8717% fixed per-year interest rates. AidData confirms this with a copy of the Facility Agreement, which can be accessed in its entirety via https://www.dropbox.com/s/7n4vmwghjknxz0o/linea-de-credito-fas-IV-CDB.pdf?dl=0. The midpoint between the interest rates for the two tranches is 7.06085%, indicating the Ministry of Finance did not get the interest rate they reported in this press release via this mechanism. This issue warrants further investigation.2. The loan being rescheduled is sometimes referred to as Credit Line IV (línea IV de crédito), insofar as it is the fourth in a set of separate loan agreements signed between 2010 and 2016. These agreements between the Government of Ecuador and China Development Bank total $7 billion and are related to a multi-party contractual structure that involves crude oil delivery contracts entered into with PetroChina and Unipec.3. The original repayment schedule for the CDB loan can be found on pages 72 and 73 of the Facility Agreement.4. The pause in repayments can be seen in the July 2021 statistical bulletin from the Ecuador Ministry of Finance. Despite a repayment originally due on July 29, 2021, the loan balance remains the same from the beginning to end of the month.5. The April 2016 loan has two tranches. Tranche A is worth $1.5 billion and Tranche B is worth RMB 3,255,000,000 (approximately $500 million). Under the August 5, 2020 debt rescheduling agreement, Tranche A and Tranche B repayments were postponed.","# Sector

91357,HEALTH,Ecuador Ministry of Public Health draws from CDB credit line to purchase medical equipment worth USD 20.9 million from Sinopharm (Linked to Project ID#92930 and #91328),"On April 10, 2020, the Ministry of Public Health of Ecuador and China Sinopharm International signed a Framework Agreement, in which both parties agreed the Ministry of Health could purchase up to USD 40 million in medical supplies from Sinopharm, and that these purchases would be funded via an unspecified line of credit from Chinese Development Bank (CDB).  Then, on May 4, 2020, the Ministry of Health and Sinopharm signed two separate procurement contracts. The first was for the Acquisition of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for the COVID-19 Sanitary Emergency (Contract No. 00053-2020), and was worth USD 7,585,000 (captured via Project ID#92930). The second was for the Acquisition of Equipment for the COVID-19 Sanitary Emergency, and was worth USD 20,954,285 (captured via Project ID#91357).  The materials were purchased by the Ministry of Public Health with the aim of strengthening hospital capacity to treat COVID-19. Materials were to be distributed to all hospitals in Ecuador, prioritizing the Sierra region. In addition to the materials themselves, the contracts provided for the transportation and delivery of the goods to the cities of Guayaquil and Quito. China Sinopharm also agreed to provide on-site technical assistance for all products delivered to Ecuador. This technical assistance component is captured via Project ID#91328.  The USD 7.585 million contract included the purchase of 500,000 medical protection respirators (PFE>95%) for USD 1.825 million (USD 3.65 per unit); 2,500,000 surgical face masks for USD 1.725 million (USD 0.69 per unit); 100,000 medical protective coveralls for USD 2.948 million (USD 29.48 per unit); 500,000 pairs of latex surgical gloves for USD 575,000 (USD 1.15 per pair); 100,000 medical goggles for USD 486,000 (USD 4.86 per unit); and 100,000 sample swabs for USD 26,000 (USD 0.26 per unit).  The USD 20.9 million contract included portable ventilators worth USD 1.430 million total; two varieties of ventilators with integrated turbines worth USD 1.325 million and USD 282,225 respectively in total; advanced vital sign monitors worth USD 2.544 million total; defibrillators with basic monitors worth USD 312,700 total; two varieties of portable ultrasound machines worth USD 2,179,360 and USD 4.664 million respectively in total; and two varieties of portable x ray machines worth USD 4.785 million and USD 3.432 million respectively in total.  The delivery of the materials purchased via both contracts took place in three batches. On June 24, 2020, the first batch arrived via airplane at Quito's Mariscal Sucre International Airport, containing 71 tons of medical supplies and equipment. This batch reportedly included x-rays, monitors, respirators, and defibrillators. It is unknown how much personal protective equipment also arrived on this flight.  On June 30, 2020, the second batch arrived at Quito's Mariscal Sucre International Airport. This flight contained 31 tons of supplies including 685 sets of ventilators, monitors, and other medical equipment, as well as 3.8 million pieces of personal protective equipment. A handover ceremony was held following the arrival of this batch of materials, attended by representatives from China Sinopharm International Corporation, the Vice Minister of Governance and Health Surveillance of Ecuador, the Minister of Finance of Ecuador, and the Chinese Ambassador to Ecuador.   Per reports from Sinopharm, the two chartered flights arrived 9 days prior to the delivery date in the contract, and the process of gathering the purchased materials took 14 days.  The third batch was sent to Ecuador via cargo ship, and was expected to arrive in Guayaquil on July 25, 2020. Reports only indicate that this batch contained 20 mobile x-ray units.  The acquisition contracts signed on May 4, 2020, were the subject of controversy in Ecuador. This prompted the Ministry of Health to release a statement on May 17, 2020, which, among other defenses of the decision, stated that the CDB credit line used to make the purchases carried specific conditions for use. One of these conditions was contracting with a Chinese company.  On September 30, 2020, Ecuador's Council for Citizen Participation and Social Control began the process of opening citizen oversight proceedings regarding the USD 20.9 million contract. A call for citizen participants ran from February 22 to March 12, 2021. As of February 2023, no updates on these proceedings were available.","1. In press releases regarding the arrival of the second batch of materials, Ecuador's Ministry of Public Health reported the purchase involved a total investment of USD $26,686,000. However, the combined value of the two contracts signed May 4, 2020, is USD $28,539,285 according to a document published by Ecuador's Official Public Procurement System. Other sources verify the value of the contracts individually, including official Government of Ecuador sources for the 20.9 million USD contract and images of official source excerpts published by investigative journalists. The 20.9 million and 7.5 million USD numbers have therefore been reported as the contract values. It is unknown if the USD $26,686,000 represents just the value of the materials on the second flight (31 tons of supplies), the materials on the first two flights combined (31 + 71 tons of supplies), is simply an inconsistency, or something else. This issue warrants further investigation.2. The specific China Development Bank credit line that financed these purchases is unknown. Investigative journalists from Periodismo Investigación published a letter from Carlos Julio Jaramillo Vintimilla of Ecuador Development Bank (BDE) to CDB representatives dated March 21, 2020 (Oficio Nro. BDE-BDE-2020-0136-OF). This letter requested the use of the B Tranche of a credit line signed with CDB on October 20, 2017 for 'areas of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 virus; allowing us to acquired [sic] and distribute several medical supplies and equipment in an urgent manner according to our clearly defined territorial needs'. This credit line is captured via Project ID#91971. However, these is no evidence presented that the funds specifically from the October 2017 credit line Tranche B were (1) released as requested and (2) applied to this project. This claim is also not made by investigative journalists at Periodismo Investigación. Further, according to Project ID#91971, only USD $1.63 million had been actually disbursed through this credit line by the end of 2020 (although $71.08 million had been approved/formally committed). Full versions of the May 4, 2020 contracts may include reference to the specific CDB credit line used for the purchases, but even this is not guaranteed. These full contracts are, further, not currently available. This issue warrants further investigation. 3. Other recent CDB credit lines to Ecuador that may have financed this project are captured via Project IDs: #59015, #59014, #62782, #58842, and #58839. This is a non-exhaustive list of possible funding sources, and this issue warrants further investigation.4.  A transaction amount has not been included on this project in order to avoid double counting because it is very likely the CDB credit line used to finance this purchase is already captured in AidData's database, either via Project ID#91971 or one of the other records capturing CDB credit lines to Ecuador. 5. While a full version of neither the April 10, 2020 Framework Agreement nor the two May 4, 2020 Sales Contracts are available, investigative journalists published parts of the documents here: https://twitter.com/VillaFernando_/status/1262098461803118593 and here: https://periodismodeinvestigacion.com/2020/05/20/china-enfermedad-y-mal-remedio/. Further, a summary document from the Ministry of Health Ecuador, published on the Official Public Procurement System of Ecuador website, contains details regarding the May 4, 2020 contracts. This document can be downloaded from here: https://www.compraspublicas.gob.ec/ProcesoContratacion/compras/PC/bajarArchivo.cpe?Archivo=A2BY73my_TdsvGWGbOOUEP7hygbtfIHPIuETtMA5yxI,5. The date on which the CDB credit line funds were officially committed or approved to fund these purchase contracts is unknown. Thus, the date the contracts were signed (May 4, 2020) has been used as a proxy for the commitment date.7. Intent for this project has been set to Mixed insofar as the CDB credit line that financed it carried the provision that proceeds be used to contract exclusively with Chinese companies. This indicates a combined commercial - development intent.","# Sector

Patricio Pazmiño, the Vice Minister of the Interior, attended the ceremony. TW Logistic Group helped facilitate the handover of the donation.","1. TW Logistics may have, instead of facilitating the donation, been one of the donors. However, AidData assumes it is an implementing organization due to the lack of information about the company (that is, it cannot be verified to be a member of the Chinese Enterprises Chamber of Commerce) and the phrasing of the sign in which TW Logistics is mentioned (the company contributed to the handover of the donation of materials from...the Chamber of Commerce/'contribuye con la entrega de donación de materiales de...la Cámara de Comercio'). Further, if it is a member of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Ecuador, it cannot be confirmed to be a majority state-owned company, and therefore does not merit a project.2. The supplies described as CRBC's portion of the donation in the project description may be the contents of the overall donation. If this were the case, known materials and their value would be subject to AidData's equal contribution, and CCCC, CRBC, and the Chamber of Commerce would each have an estimated contribution of 1/3 of 90,000 USD. This possibility arises from the fact that many sources about this donation report as if CRBC is the only donor, when it is known - based on photographs of the handover ceremony - that CCCC contributed as well. However, the wording alone of the Chinese Embassy's Tweet and the article from Ecuador's National Police, while somewhat ambiguous, seem to indicate better that CRBC alone contributed the 90,000 USD in supplies.3. A project has not been created for the Chinese Enterprise Chamber of Commerce in Ecuador's contribution. For the time being, AidData does not track donations from these kinds of organizations, insofar as it is unknown which companies in particular contributed, as well as whether or not those companies are majority state-owned.","# Sector

On June 30, 2020, the second batch arrived at Quito's Mariscal Sucre International Airport. This flight contained 31 tons of supplies including 685 sets of ventilators, monitors, and other medical equipment, as well as 3.8 million pieces of personal protective equipment. A handover ceremony was held following the arrival of this batch of materials, attended by representatives from China Sinopharm International Corporation, the Vice Minister of Governance and Health Surveillance of Ecuador, the Minister of Finance of Ecuador, and the Chinese Ambassador to Ecuador.  Per reports from Sinopharm, the two chartered flights arrived 9 days prior to the delivery date in the contract, and the process of gathering the purchased materials took 14 days.  The third batch was sent to Ecuador via cargo ship, and was expected to arrive in Guayaquil on July 25, 2020. Reports only indicate that this batch contained 20 mobile x-ray units.  The acquisition contracts signed on May 4, 2020, were the subject of controversy in Ecuador. This prompted the Ministry of Health to release a statement on May 17, 2020, which, among other defenses of the decision, stated that the CDB credit line used to make the purchases carried specific conditions for use. One of these conditions was contracting with a Chinese company.  On September 30, 2020, Ecuador's Council for Citizen Participation and Social Control began the process of opening citizen oversight proceedings regarding the USD 20.9 million contract. A call for citizen participants ran from February 22 to March 12, 2021. As of February 2023, no updates on these proceedings were available.","1. In press releases regarding the arrival of the second batch of materials, Ecuador's Ministry of Public Health reported the purchase involved a total investment of USD $26,686,000. However, the combined value of the two contracts signed May 4, 2020, is USD $28,539,285 according to a document published by Ecuador's Official Public Procurement System. Other sources verify the value of the contracts individually, including official Government of Ecuador sources for the 20.9 million USD contract and images of official source excerpts published by investigative journalists. The 20.9 million and 7.5 million USD numbers have therefore been reported as the contract values. It is unknown if the USD $26,686,000 represents just the value of the materials on the second flight (31 tons of supplies), the materials on the first two flights combined (31 + 71 tons of supplies), is simply an inconsistency, or something else. This issue warrants further investigation.2. The specific China Development Bank credit line that financed these purchases is unknown. Investigative journalists from Periodismo Investigación published a letter from Carlos Julio Jaramillo Vintimilla of Ecuador Development Bank (BDE) to CDB representatives dated March 21, 2020 (Oficio Nro. BDE-BDE-2020-0136-OF). This letter requested the use of the B Tranche of a credit line signed with CDB on October 20, 2017 for 'areas of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 virus; allowing us to acquired [sic] and distribute several medical supplies and equipment in an urgent manner according to our clearly defined territorial needs'. This credit line is captured via Project ID#91971.However, these is no evidence presented that the funds specifically from the October 2017 credit line Tranche B were (1) released as requested and (2) applied to this project. This claim is also not made by investigative journalists at Periodismo Investigación. Further, according to Project ID#91971, only USD $1.63 million had been actually disbursed through this credit line by the end of 2020 (although $71.08 million had been approved/formally committed). Full versions of the May 4, 2020 contracts may include reference to the specific CDB credit line used for the purchases, but even this is not guaranteed. These full contracts are, further, not currently available. This issue warrants further investigation.3. Other recent CDB credit lines to Ecuador that may have financed this project are captured via Project IDs: #59015, #59014, #62782, #58842, and #58839. This is a non-exhaustive list of possible funding sources, and this issue warrants further investigation.4. A transaction amount has not been included on this project in order to avoid double counting because it is very likely the CDB credit line used to finance this purchase is already captured in AidData's database, either via Project ID#91971 or one of the other records capturing CDB credit lines to Ecuador.5. While a full version of neither the April 10, 2020 Framework Agreement nor the two May 4, 2020 Sales Contracts are available, investigative journalists published parts of the documents here: https://twitter.com/VillaFernando_/status/1262098461803118593 and here: https://periodismodeinvestigacion.com/2020/05/20/china-enfermedad-y-mal-remedio/. Further, a summary document from the Ministry of Health Ecuador, published on the Official Public Procurement System of Ecuador website, contains details regarding the May 4, 2020 contracts. This document can be downloaded from here: https://www.compraspublicas.gob.ec/ProcesoContratacion/compras/PC/bajarArchivo.cpe?Archivo=A2BY73my_TdsvGWGbOOUEP7hygbtfIHPIuETtMA5yxI,6. The date on which the CDB credit line funds were officially committed or approved to fund these purchase contracts is unknown. Thus, the date the contracts were signed (May 4, 2020) has been used as a proxy for the commitment date.7. Intent for this project has been set to Mixed insofar as the CDB credit line that financed it carried the provision that proceeds be used to contract exclusively with Chinese companies. This indicates a combined commercial - development intent.","# Sector

# Description
On April 10, 2020, the Ministry of Public Health of Ecuador and China Sinopharm International signed a Framework Agreement, in which both parties agreed the Ministry of Health could purchase up to USD 40 million in medical supplies from Sinopharm, and that these purchases would be funded via an unspecified line of credit from Chinese Development Bank (CDB).  Then, on May 4, 2020, the Ministry of Health and Sinopharm signed two separate procurement contracts. The first was for the Acquisition of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for the COVID-19 Sanitary Emergency (Contract No. 00053-2020), and was worth USD 7,585,000 (captured via Project ID#92930). The second was for the Acquisition of Equipment for the COVID-19 Sanitary Emergency, and was worth USD 20,954,285 (captured via Project ID#91357).  The materials were purchased by the Ministry of Public Health with the aim of strengthening hospital capacity to treat COVID-19. Materials were to be distributed to all hospitals in Ecuador, prioritizing the Sierra region. In addition to the materials themselves, the contracts provided for the transportation and delivery of the goods to the cities of Guayaquil and Quito. China Sinopharm also agreed to provide on-site technical assistance for all products delivered to Ecuador. This technical assistance component is captured via Project ID#91328.  The USD 7.585 million contract included the purchase of 500,000 medical protection respirators (PFE>95%) for USD 1.825 million (USD 3.65 per unit); 2,500,000 surgical face masks for USD 1.725 million (USD 0.69 per unit); 100,000 medical protective coveralls for USD 2.948 million (USD 29.48 per unit); 500,000 pairs of latex surgical gloves for USD 575,000 (USD 1.15 per pair); 100,000 medical goggles for USD 486,000 (USD 4.86 per unit); and 100,000 sample swabs for USD 26,000 (USD 0.26 per unit).  The USD 20.9 million contract included portable ventilators worth USD 1.430 million total; two varieties of ventilators with integrated turbines worth USD 1.325 million and USD 282,225 respectively in total; advanced vital sign monitors worth USD 2.544 million total; defibrillators with basic monitors worth USD 312,700 total; two varieties of portable ultrasound machines worth USD 2,179,360 and USD 4.664 million respectively in total; and two varieties of portable x ray machines worth USD 4.785 million and USD 3.432 million respectively in total.
