Then, on February 15, 2008, Chinese Ambassador Shi Longzhuang and Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the International Convention Center and Government Building Complex Construction Project. On September 7, 2008, the Chinese Minister of Commerce Chen Deming and the Deputy Prime Minister of Samoa, Honorable Misa Telefon Retzlaff, held talks in Xiamen.  After the talks, Li Jun, Deputy Governor of China Eximbank, and Hinaray Petana, Chief Executive Officer of the Ministry of Finance of Samoa, signed a $52 million concessional loan agreement for the International Convention Center and Government Building Complex Construction Project on behalf of their governments. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 0.75% commitment fee, and a 0.1% management fee. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract with Shanghai Construction Engineering Group (SCG), which as signed on June 13, 2008.  The loan had achieved a 100% disbursement rate as of June 30, 2017.

The purpose of the project was to construct a 6-story, 2500 square foot government office complex (that can house ten government ministries and corporations and offices of four ministers) and an international convention center (located behind the government office complex) with seating capacity for 450 people. The convention center is fully equipped with interpreter rooms, video conference systems and a state of the art PA sound system.
