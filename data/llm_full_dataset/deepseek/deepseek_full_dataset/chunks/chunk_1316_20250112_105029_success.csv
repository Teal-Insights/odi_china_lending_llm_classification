58924,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",China Eximbank provides $235.2 million buyer's credit loan to Ethiopian Shipping Lines (ESL) for the construction of nine shipping vessels,"On September 1, 2010, China Eximbank provided a $235.2 million buyer’s credit loan to Ethiopian Shipping Lines S.C (ESL or 俄比亚船运与物流公司举) for the construction of nine shipping vessels. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the loan was backed by a sovereign guarantee and a Sinosure credit insurance policy. It is also known that the borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 80% of the cost of a $294 million commercial contract between ESL and China Poly Group Corporation (中国保利集团有限公司), which was signed in 2010.    According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $235.2 million (ETB 3,216,027,397) loan achieved a 28% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 3 loan disbursements (worth ETB 938,738,101) between 2011 and 2012: an ETB 172,782.818 disbursement on October 10, 2011, an ETB 117,749.135 disbursement on January 9, 2012, and an ETB 648,206,148 disbursement on October 10, 2012.    Of the nine vessels that the ESL purchased, seven were to be multi-purpose freighters and two to be oil tankers. The vessels, which were produced by Shandong Huanghai Shipbuilding and delivered by China Poly Group Corporation, were ordered by ESL around January 2011 and they were officially handed over to the Ethiopian Shipping and Logistics Service Enterprise (ESLESE) on May 17, 2014. ESLESE initially operated these nine vessels. However, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the nine vessels are now being leased by a company other than ESLESE.","1. The system identification number for this project in the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP) is 87143122101160. 2. The AMP identifies the face value of the loan as ETB 3,216,027,397. 1 Ethiopian Birr (ETB) was equal to 0.06 United States Dollars (USD) in September 2010, which implies that the USD face value of the loan was $192,961,643.82. 3. The Chinese project title is 9艘货船. 4. For the time being, AidData assumes that this loan is backed by a sovereign guarantee because the Government of Ethiopia’s Ministry of Finance indicates in its Public Sector Debt Statistical Bulletin No. 15 that ‘government-guaranteed external debt comprises of loans and suppliers credits contracted by public enterprises, mainly the Ethiopian Electric Power (EEP), Ethiopian Electric Utility (EEU), Ethiopian Sugar Corporation, Ethiopian Railways Corporation, Ethiopian Shipping Lines and guaranteed by MoFED as well as the state owned bank — the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE).’ 5. China Poly Group Corporation is a state owned Chinese business group among 102 central state owned enterprises under the supervision of State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council. 6. ESLSE is a public-sector company that provides logistics shipping services (sea transport, agency services, stevedoring, and shore handling); clearing and freight forwarding by its MTS representation in Djibouti (customs clearance, port clearance, and road freight); and port and terminal services (receiving and delivering cargo, cargo loading and unloading, filling and emptying of containers, etc.). In 2011, Ethiopia decided to merge three organizations -- the former Ethiopian Shipping Lines S.C, Maritime and Transit Services Enterprise, and Dry Port Services Enterprise -- into a new company named the Ethiopian Shipping and Logistics Services Enterprise (ESLESE).7. According to Ethiopia's Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, the Government of Ethiopia signed a $234,766,400 loan agreement with China Eximbank for unspecified purposes on December 30, 2010. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 3.067%, a grace period of 4 years, and maturity of 11 years. AidData currently captures the $234,766,400 loan as a separate, stand-alone record for an unspecified purpose (as captured via Project ID#30555). However, it is possible that this is the same loan that China Eximbank provided to Ethiopian Shipping Lines (ESL) for the construction of nine shipping vessels. This issue warrants further investigation.","# Sector

59050,TRANSPORT AND STORAGE,Chinese Government provides RMB 360 million interest-free loan for Pushkin Square-Gotera Interchange Road Project (Linked to Project ID#100 and ID#91947),"On December 27, 2016, the Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified an RMB 360 million (ETB 623,366,177) interest-free loan agreement with the Chinese Government for the Pushkin Square-Gotera Interchange Road Project (via Proclamation no. 986/2017). The ratification proclamation entered into force on January 12, 2017.   The interest-free loan was issued by the Agency for International Economic Cooperation within China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM). The loan proceeds were drawn from Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreements (ECTAs) that the Chinese Government and the Ethiopian Government had previously signed on July 20, 2010, April 18, 2011, August 15, 2011, January 28, 2012, October 29, 2012, and May 24, 2013.   The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance an RMB 308,526,277.10 commercial contract between Addis Ababa City Roads Authority and China First Highway Engineering Co., Ltd. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the ETB 623,366,177 loan achieved a 132% disbursement rate, with MOFCOM making 4 loan disbursements (worth ETB 825,594,492) between 2020 and 2021: an ETB 194,164,377 disbursement on June 9, 2020, an ETB 565,829,909 disbursement on March 24, 2021, an ETB 12,455,390 disbursement on August 17, 2021, and an ETB 53,144,816 disbursement on October 13, 2021.  However, according to the AMP, MOFCOM ultimately decided to cancel RMB 310 million of the Government of Ethiopia’s loan repayment obligations (due to its debt sustainability problems). This act of debt forgiveness is captured via Project ID#91947.   The project will involve the construction of a 3.8 km road with a width of 30-45 meters that stretches from Pushkin Square to Gotera Interchange in Nifas Silk Laphto District. It has three segments: a 2.3 km road from Pushkin Square to the Gotera Interchange section stretches to 2.3 km and two feeder roads — Mauritius Street and Tanzania Street — that measure 1.5 km in length. The project also includes a two-lane 320 meter tunnel, bus rapid transit (BRT), and two interchanges. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the project will reduce traffic congestion in Addis Ababa and ensure the smooth flow of vehicles coming from Kirkos, Gotera, Gofa, Sar Bet, Mexico and Keria. The Gotera-Pushkin Square interchange is being built to accommodate three planned BRT lines that all intersect there: the B2 (under construction with AFD financing), the B3 (under construction with Korean ExIm financing), and the B6 (under construction with Korean ExIm financing), as well as decently integrated facilities for non-motorized travel.   China First Highway Engineering Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of CCCC, is the contractor responsible for project implementation. A consortium consisting of First Highway Consultant Co., Ltd and Xi'an Fangzhou Engineering Consulting Company Co. Ltd is responsible for project management. Best Consulting Engineers Private Limited Company is responsible for providing project consulting services.    A groundbreaking ceremony for the project took place on October 1, 2019. Liu Yu, Economic and Commercial Counsellor at the Embassy of China, Takele Uma, Mayor of Addis Ababa, Ahmed Shide, Ethiopia’s Minister of Finance, and Tan Jian, Chinese Ambassador to Ethiopia, attended the ceremony. Then, in May 2020, the Deputy Mayor of Addis Ababa conducted a project site visit and announced that the project was expected to reach completion within a year (May 2021). The project ultimately reached completion on August 15, 2022.  This project has faced local scrutiny and criticism due to the fact that it was reportedly the most expensive road project to ever be undertaken (in unit cost terms) in Ethiopia (at ETB 395 million per kilometer of road).   According to an October 2021 report, ‘Chinese engineers do not appear to have played a significant role in the conceptual design of the interchange. The BRT facilities that have been incorporated into the design have largely been designed by the consultants to the [French Development Agency, AFD], with input from ITDP Africa, and the main role of the Chinese firm building the road was to follow the designs made by other consultants. Th[is] trajectory indicates significant improvement on the part of Chinese-financed urban road projects over the course of the decade, with considerable progress still to be made, but this improvement appears to result primarily from the increasing sophistication of the Ethiopian government authorities rather than from any push from the Chinese ECAs or Chinese companies’.","1.  Since loan terms for the interest-free loan are unavailable, AidData has set maturity period to 20 years by default and grace period to 10 years by default per China's Foreign Assistance White Paper (http://www.cidca.gov.cn/2018-08/06/c_129925064_3.htm) which states that the maturity period of interest-free loans is 20 years, with a drawdown period of 5 years, grace period of 5 years, and repayment over 10 years.

According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the ETB 4,053,424,658 loan achieved a 111% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 15 loan disbursements (worth ETB 4,499,623,058) between 2014 and 2019: an ETB 234,280,303 disbursement on October 8, 2013, an ETB 158,812,261 disbursement on January 8, 2014, an ETB 194,174,757 disbursement on April 8, 2014, an ETB 1,200,000,000 disbursement on October 8, 2014, an ETB 404,040,404 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 265,556,593 disbursement on April 8, 2015, an ETB 102,387,246 disbursement on July 8, 2015, an ETB 405,453,493 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 153,171,320 disbursement on January 7, 2016, an ETB 244,603,535 disbursement on April 7, 2016, an ETB 145,293,164 disbursement on July 7, 2016, an ETB 27,576,322 disbursement on October 7, 2016, an ETB 522,418,088 disbursement on January 7, 2017, an ETB 45,062,662 disbursement on April 7, 2017, and an ETB 396,792,911 disbursement on March 27, 2019.   The purpose of the project was to construct the 254MW Genale-Dawa III multipurpose hydropower plant. The plant consists of a concrete faced rock fill dam and an underground powerhouse. Based on the estimated sedimentation level, the project will have a lifetime of more than 1,000 years. The dam site is located in a low seismic hazard area of class I. The dam is 110m high, 456m wide and 450m long. It is made with groutable and non-erodible rock and has a volume of 3.2 million cubic metres (mm3). At the full capacity, the dam can store up to 2,570mm3 of water. It has a catchment area of 10,445km2 and a fill volume of 890,000m3. The dam spillway is an open chute type with an ogee weir crest and three radial spillway gates. The underground powerhouse is installed with three vertical Francis turbine generators with a capacity of 84.7MW each. It is housed within an underground cavern measuring 60m-long, 20m-wide and 41m deep and also includes auxiliary equipment. A 12.4km long, 8.1m diameter headrace tunnel carries water from the dam through a 188m deep steel-lined vertical shaft to a three-pronged manifold. The manifold feeds the water to the turbine inlet valves of the three turbines housed in the powerhouse. A 820m long tailrace tunnel and a 480m long open channel returns the water back to the river. A transformer cavern is located downstream of the powerhouse and includes three step-up transformers. The electricity generated is transferred from the transformers to a 230kV/400kV switchyard located above ground through a 500m long cable tunnel.   The project area is located in Kobadi, some 400 km (air distance) south-east of Addis Ababa and some 200 km (air distance) north of the border with Kenya. The scheme, including the reservoir and power waterways, extends over a river corridor some 55 km long. The approximate centroid of the project area lies at latitude 5º 38' North and longitude 39º 43' East.   CGGC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. However, several other contractors were involved in the project. Stantec, a US-based company, provided design, planning, management and consulting services. Lahmeyer International, a German company, conducted the feasibility study. Tunnelpro, an Italy-based supplier, provided tunnel boring machines.   Project implementation commenced in March 2011 and the project was originally expected to commence on January 1, 2010 and reach completion within 48.5 months (January 15, 2014). However, the project encountered multiple implementation delays. An inauguration ceremony was held to commemorate the project’s completion on February 4, 2020. The project temporarily employed 390 Ethiopian workers.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the 254MW Genale Dawa III Hydroelectric Power Station Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023.","1. This project is also known as the 254MW Genale-Dawa III Hydroelectric Power Station Project, the Geneale-Dawa-Multi Purpose Hydroelectric Project, and the GD-3 Project. The Chinese project title is 埃塞GD-3水电站工程. 2. A September 26, 2010 amendment to the EPC contract between Gezhouba Group Company Limited and Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation indicates that the borrower is responsible for 15% of the EPC contract (Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation), which implies that the lender (China Eximbank) may have been responsible for 85% of the EPC contract value ($383,399,300.85). However, for the time being, AidData relies on the face value of the loan ($295,927,736) that is reported by the Ethiopia Public Sector Debt Statistical Bulletin No.7.  3. The system identification number for this project in the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP) is 87143122101156. 4. 1 Ethiopian Birr (ETB) was equal to 0.060 United States Dollars (USD) in September 2010 which implies that the loan commitment value recorded in the AMP (ETB 4,053,424,658) was equivalent to USD 243,205,479.48. SAIS-CARI identifies the face value of the loan as $270 million, which is roughly equivalent to 60% of the cost of the 2010 commercial (EPC) contract between EEPCo and CGGC. 5. Ethiopia Public Sector Debt Statistical Bulletin No.7. identifies the loan commitment date as October 27, 2010. The AMP identifies the loan commitment date as September 1, 2010. This discrepancy warrants further investigation. 6.  In 2009, the Government of Ethiopia and China Eximbank signed a $400 million general buyer’s credit loan agreement for multiple road and power projects, including the 254MW Genale Dawa III Hydroelectric Power Station Project. It appears that the September 1, 2010 BCL represents a subsidiary loan agreement.
