Ukraine’s Cabinet of Ministers issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan on June 16, 2011. SC ""National Project ""Airexpress"" also purchased buyer’s credit insurance from Sinosure on July 25, 2012 (at an additional cost of $36.39 million).

The second tranche was worth $320,189,643 and it was earmarked for construction activities (phase 2 of the project). The borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to finance two separate EPC contracts with China National Complete Engineering Corporation (CMCEC) that were signed on April 18, 2011.

It also unsuccessfully attempted to reallocate the second loan tranche to the Podil-Voskresensk Bridge Project and the Kiev Subway Extension Project.
