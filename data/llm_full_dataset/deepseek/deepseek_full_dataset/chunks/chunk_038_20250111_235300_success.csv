The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.6% margin, a grace period of 3 years, and a maturity of 13 years. The Government of Ethiopia issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. Sinosure provided buyer’s credit insurance. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance a $682 million commercial (EPC) contract that it had signed in March 2013 with China National Complete Plant Import Export Corporation (COMPLANT) for the construction of the Omo Kuraz 2 sugar factory and Omo Kuraz 3 sugar factory.

According to the AMP, the CDB loan was restructured on an unspecified date to reduce the amount that the borrower would be responsible for repaying by 50% over a 5-year period. This loan rescheduling is captured via Project ID#92357.   The purpose of the project was to construct the Omo Kuraz 2 Sugar Factory in South Omo within South Nations Nationalities and Peoples Regional State (SNNPRS). The precise locational coordinates of the factory are 5.90692, 36.03851. Upon completion, the factory was expected to crush 6,000 to 12,000 tons of sugar cane a day. The factory was also expected to generate 60MW of electricity and send 40MW of electricity to the national power grid (as the sugar factory only requires 20MW).   COMPLANT was the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Construction began in July 2014. Then, on December 3, 2016, a training course was completed for local employees on the operations and maintenance of the sugar factory. Two weeks later, on December 18, 2016, the Prime Minister of Ethiopia conducted an on-site project inspection. As of the end of the fiscal year 2016/17, the project had achieved a 94.5% completion rate but it was running behind schedule. The sugar factory began trial production activities on March 27, 2017. It went into full production on December 31, 2017. However, in October 2019, Ethiopia's Auditor-General Gemechu Dubiso announced that he was investigating the possibility that funds earmarked by ESC for ten state-owned sugar factories (potentially including the Omo Kuraz 2 Sugar Factory) were stolen or misappropriated. Then, in July 2021, the Government of Ethiopia announced that it would privatize the Omo Kuraz 2 sugar factory due to debt sustainability problems and the inability of the ESC to fund the operations of the faltering sugar factory and several others.","1.

The all-in interest rate (2.961%) was estimated by adding a 2.6% margin to average 6-Month LIBOR in October 2013 (0.361%). 3. In 2012, China Development Bank issued a $500 million loan (export buyer’s credit) to the Ethiopian Sugar Corporation (ESC) for the construction of the Omo Kuraz 2-3 Project (i.e. the construction of the Omo Kuraz 2 sugar factory and the construction of the Omo Kuraz 3 sugar factory). $210 million of this loan was initially earmarked for the construction the Omo Kuraz 2 facility. 4.
