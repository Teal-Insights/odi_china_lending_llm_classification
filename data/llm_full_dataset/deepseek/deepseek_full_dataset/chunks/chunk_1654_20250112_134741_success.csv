AidData has estimated the all-in interest rate by adding 3% to average 6-month LIBOR rate in January 2005 (2.891%).2. On December 22, 2004, Rosneft purchased for nominal consideration a 100% interest in Baikalfinancegroup LLC (“Baikalfinancegroup”), which had won an auction for the sale of 76.79% of the shares (100% of the common shares) of Yuganskneftegaz at a price of RUB 260.782 billion ($9.398 billion at the CBR exchange rate in effect as at the settlement date). The auction was conducted on December 19, 2004 by the Russian bailiff service to enforce tax liens against Yukos, which had previously controlled Yuganskneftegaz. Following Rosneft’s acquisition of Baikalfinancegroup, Rosneft issued loans to Baikalfinancegroup to enable it to repay the principal of and interest on the debt it had incurred to finance its deposit for the auction, and to purchase and pay for the shares of Yuganskneftegaz it had won in the auction. Baikalfinancegroup purchased and paid for these shares on December 31, 2004. The sources of the funds that Rosneft loaned to Baikalfinancegroup and also used to meet Yuganskneftegaz’’ immediate working capital requirements included: (1) borrowings characterized as long-term loans in the aggregate amount of USD 6,465 million (including $6 billion from China Eximbank and China Development Bank and $465 million from Sberbank); (2) short-term borrowings in the aggregate amount of $1.442 billion; and (3) funds, in the aggregate amount of approximately $1.746 billion, accumulated from the sale of Rosneft’s interests in the Prirazlomnoye and Shtokmanovskoye projects, including $1,344 billion from the sale of Rosneft’s 50% interest in CJSC Sevmorneftegaz. The borrowings characterized as long-term loans included $6 billion obtained from Vnesheconombank, initially through the issue of promissory notes by Rosneft and its subsidiaries in December 2004.
