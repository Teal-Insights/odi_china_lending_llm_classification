89441,BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES,CBR makes RMB 1.14 billion drawdown under currency swap agreement with PBOC in 2017,"On October 13, 2014, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) and the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) signed an RMB 150 billion (RUB 1.325 trillion) bilateral currency swap agreement to facilitate trade and improve foreign currency liquidity in Russia. On November 22, 2017, the CBR and the PBOC renewed the currency swap agreement (facility) to RMB 150 billion for a term of three years. On November 22, 2020, the CBR and the PBOC renewed the RMB 150 billion (RUB 1.325 trillion) currency swap agreement (facility) for a further term of three years. The CBR made four (gross) drawdowns under these currency swap agreements: an RMB 10,000,000 drawdown in 2015 (captured via Project ID#89439), an RMB 903,000,000 drawdown in 2016 (captured via Project ID#89440), an RMB 1,144,000,000 drawdown in 2017 (captured via Project ID#89441), and an RMB 891 million drawdown in 2018 (captured via Project ID#89442).The interest rates and maturities that applied to these borrowings are unknown. According to the CBR, the total (principal) amount outstanding under the PBOC currency swap facility was RMB 0 in 2014, RMB 10 million in 2015, RMB 903 million in 2016, RMB 1.144 billion in 2017, RMB 891 million in 2018, RMB 0 in 2019, RMB 0 in 2020, and RMB 0 in 2021.","1. A bilateral currency swap (BCS) agreement — also known as a central bank liquidity swap agreement — is an agreement between the central banks of two countries to exchange cash flows in different currencies at predetermined rates over a specified period of time. Central banks participate in these agreements to facilitate bilateral trade settlements using their national currencies (rather than relying upon on a third-party currency such as the U.S. dollar), manage demands from their local banks, and provide liquidity support to financial markets. The party that draws down on the swap line becomes the borrower and the other party becomes lender. During the term of the swap, the party that draws down on the swap line makes either fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amount. If both parties draw down on the swap line, then both parties exchange fixed or floating interest payments on the principal amounts.  The 5-step process of drawing upon a currency swap line with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) can described from the perspective of an importer in a given country (‘Country X’) seeking to settle trade with a Chinese firm in RMB. Step 1: The central bank of Country X and the PBOC activate their currency swap in advance, at which point each party deposits a specific amount of its currency in an account controlled by the other party (i.e. the central bank of Country X deposits local currency in an account controlled by the PBOC, and the PBOC deposits an equivalent amount in RMB in an account controlled by the central bank of Country X). Step 2: A firm in Country X that imports goods from China applies for an RMB-denominated loan from a domestic bank. Step 3: The domestic bank in Country X that receives the loan application then applies to its central bank for an RMB-denominated loan. After a review process, the central bank of Country X notifies the domestic bank applicant that its loan application was approved. The central bank of Country X subsequently requests that the PBOC transfer RMB funds from the central bank of Country X’s swap account within the PBOC to the loan applicant’s account with a corresponding bank in China. Step 4:  The domestic bank in Country X directs the corresponding bank in China to transfer RMB funds into a Chinese exporter’s account, and the corresponding bank in China provides RMB funds to the Chinese exporter. Step 5: The importer in Country X repays the RMB-denominated loan at its maturity date. The domestic bank notifies the central bank of Country X of the repayment, and transfers RMB into the central bank’s account within the PBOC through the corresponding bank in China. For the central bank of Country X, the RMB deposit is an asset that should be recorded on its balance sheet as an official reserve asset denominated in RMB. The contra entry of this asset is the liability in the local currency of Country X that represents China’s claims in the central bank of Country X. This should be also recorded on the balance sheet of the central bank of Country X. At the time of the exchange of currencies, it should be recorded as an increase in assets and an increase in liabilities of the monetary authorities in the balance of payments. The reason why the PBOC uses this mechanism to provide renminbi liquidity to other central bank is to increase the speed, convenience, and volume of transactions between the two countries. More detailed information about currency swaps with the PBOC can be found at https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2021/English/wpiea2021210-print-pdf.ashx and https://thechinaguys.com/the-rise-of-the-renminbi-the-reality-of-bilateral-swap-agreements/ and https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2017/pdf/17-25a.pdf. 2. AidData treats drawdowns under BCS agreements with the PBOC as collateralized loans because, in a BCS arrangement, the currency of the borrower is held as collateral while the lender receives interest on the amount drawn down by the borrower until repayment is made. 3. The CBR is sometimes also referred to as the Bank of Russia. 4. AidData has estimated the annual drawdown amounts by calculating the difference between the overall size of the currency swap agreement and the ‘unused limit’ under the currency swap agreement (facility) in any given year (as identified in CBR Annual Reports). 5. Most central banks publish their end-of-year outstanding PBOC swap debt, but only a few report detailed transaction-level data on drawdowns during the year. Therefore, if no information on drawings is available, AidData assumes that total drawdowns during the reporting period equal the amount outstanding at the end of the reporting period (and vice versa). Since the (de jure) maturities of PBOC swap drawings are 12 months or less, this creates a lower bound estimate for actual drawdowns under the PBOC swap line.  6. PBOC swap debt is frequently rolled over. In central bank reports where one can only observe the year-end outstanding amount, no distinction between rollovers and drawdowns is possible. In these cases, one can derive (new) drawdowns as the difference between the current and last year’s outstanding swap debt stock. This measure essentially captures net lending through the PBOC swap line.","# Sector

67157,ACTION RELATING TO DEBT,ICBC reschedules $42.5 million of loan principal repayments for the Kimkano-Sutarsky Mining Plant (Linked to Project ID#67153),"On March 23, 2010, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and IRC Limited signed a non-binding indicative term sheet in relation to the funding of 85 percent of the Phase 1 of the Kimkano & Sutarsky (K&S) Iron Mine Processing Plant Project. Then, on December 10, 2010, ICBC and Kimkano-Sutarsky Mining and Beneficiation Plant LLC (LLC KS GOK) — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and wholly-owned subsidiary of IRC Limited — signed a $340 million loan facility agreement for Phase 1 of the Kimkano & Sutarsky (K&S) Iron Mine Processing Plant Project. The loan, which is captured via Project ID#67153, carried the following borrowing terms: an 11.5 year maturity, a 4 year grace period, an insurance fee of 4.61% (of the face value of the loan), and an interest rate LIBOR plus a 2.8% margin. However, according to the 2018 Annual Report from Petropavlovsk (the largest shareholder of IRC Limited), the effective interest rate of this loan facility was 6.8% in 2018 and 6.41% in 2017. The loan facility was repayable semi-annually in 16 installments of $21,250,000, beginning in December 2014 and ending in June 2022 (the final maturity date). The loan was backed by a corporate repayment guarantee from Petropavlovsk PLC — the largest shareholder of IRC Limited — and a Sinosure credit insurance policy. It was also secured by (i.e. collateralized against) a minimum cash deposit in an ICBC-controlled escrow (security deposit) account. The borrower had deposited $6 million in the escrow (security deposit) account as of December 31, 2011, $6 million as of December 31, 2013, and $27,250,000 as of December 31, 2014. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a $400 million (HK$3.11 billion) engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract that it signed with China National Electric Engineering Corporation on December 6, 2010. On December 14, 2011, the LLC KS GOK made the first drawdown from the loan facility amounting to $6.9 million. As of December 31, 2014, IRC Limited had drawn down approximately $287,976,000 from the loan facility with another $52,024,000 left undrawn. On February 15, 2015, ICBC granted a conditional extension to the availability period of this undrawn amount by six months to June 8, 2015 and all relevant condition precedents were satisfied as of February 27, 2015. On December 14, 2011, the borrower made its first loan drawdown amounting to $6,958,000. During the first six months of 2012, the borrower made further drawdowns amounting to $75,519,000. Then, between December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013, the borrower made further drawdowns amounting to $187,811,000. Additional drawdowns amounting to $93,207,000 were made by the borrower in 2014. The first installment of $21,250,000 was repaid in December 2014. As of December 31, 2014, the loan’s (principal) amount outstanding was $266,726,000. There are signs that the ICBC loan underperformed vis-a-vis the lender’s original expectations. On February 27, 2017, ICBC agreed to restructure two repayment installments of the $340 million loan facility. These two rescheduled repayments of $21,250,000 were worth $42.5 million in total, and they were originally due for payment on June 20, 2017 and December 20, 2017. They were rescheduled evenly into five subsequent semi-annual repayment installments in June 20, 2018, December 20, 2018, June 20, 2019, December 20, 2019 and June 20, 2020. As a result, each of the repayment installments increased by $8.5 million to an amount equal to $29.75 million. The February 27, 2017 restructuring agreement is captured via Project ID#67157. Then, in June 2018, the loan’s corporate guarantor (Petropavlovsk PLC) announced that it would provide $29.75 million to IRC Limited to enable its wholly-owned subsidiary (LLC KS GOK) to meet a June 2018 repayment to ICBC. At the time, Petropavlovsk PLC also said that it was in ‘advanced’ talks with a major Russian bank to refinance the entire $340 million project loan. IRC Limited said n June 2018 that it LLC KS GOK was unable to meet payments to ICBC and that ‘if a missed repayment of the ICBC facility occurs, this would result in a default under the facility and would create broader problems for Petropavlovsk.’ Then, on December 18, 2018, IRC Limited entered into a facility agreement with Gazprombank (a Russian bank) worth $240 million in total. The loan facility had a maturity of March 2026 and consisted of two tranches. The principal under the first tranche amounted to $160 million with interest being charged at LIBOR plus a 5.7% margin per annum it was repayable in equal quarterly payments during the term of the Gazprombank Facility (with the final payment scheduled for December 2026). The principal under the second tranche amounted to $80 million with interest being charged at LIBOR plus a 7.7% margin per annum and it was repayable in full at the end of the loan term (December 2026). In March 2019, IRC Limited drew down $228.9 million in total from the Gazprombank Facility to fully repay the amounts outstanding under the ICBC facility (worth approximately $169 million) and the loans provided by Petropavlosk Plc (worth approximately $57 million). The remaining loan proceeds were to finance the K&S Iron Mine Processing Plant Project’s working capital needs of approximately $3 million. The K&S Mine, 100% owned by IRC Limited, is located in the Jewish Autonomous Region (EAO) of the Russian Far East. It is the second full-scale mining and processing operation that IRC Limited has developed. K&S enjoys a geographical advantage.
