The Grenada Low Income Housing Project included the construction of 2,000 low income housing units. The project was intended to address the lack of housing in Grenada after the destruction the island's housing sector experienced during Hurricane Ivan in 2004.  The Chinese Government provided several grants to the Government of Grenada for the first phase. In total, it provided $11,193,000 USD. In 2014, it provided $193,000 USD, as captured by this project.

(BCEG) was the contractor responsible for project implementation, while China International Engineering Design & Consult Co., Ltd. (CIEDC) was the contractor responsible for project design and the Xinjiang Institute of Building was the contractor responsible for project supervision.

Gay, 28 units at Frequente, and 158 units at Soubise. The total cost of the project -- which included financing from the Government of Grenada -- was $35 million XCD.
