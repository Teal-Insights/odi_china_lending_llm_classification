65829,COMMUNICATIONS,Chinese Government provides RMB 79 million grant for Phase 3 of Egyptian Remote Education Project (Linked to Project ID#543 and ID#500),"In 2002, China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) provided a $4 million grant to the Government of Egypt for Phase 1 of the Egyptian Remote Education Project (captured in Project ID#543). Then, on December 6, 2004, Egypt's Minister of State for International Cooperation, Fayza Abul Nagaa, and China's Minister of Commerce, Bo Xilai, signed an RMB 30,000,000 (approximately $4.5 million) grant agreement for Phase 2 of the Egyptian Remote Education Project (captured in Project ID#500).  Then, on October 27, 2018, the Chinese Government and the Government of Egypt signed an exchange of letters, committing RMB 79 million ($11.5 million) of grant funding for Phase 3 of the Egyptian Remote Education Project (captured in Project ID#65829). Egyptian Presidential Order No. (2019) ratified the exchange of letters into Egyptian law on June 24, 2019. The grant proceeds for Phase 3 were drawn from an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) that the two governments signed on December 23, 2014.  The purpose of the Egyptian Remote Education Project was to establish a distance learning network for Egypt's Ministry of Education. The network was designed to support basic educational courses, lectures, and teacher training activities. The project was implemented in three phases.   Phase 1 involved the establishment of 33 distance learning terminals in 27 Egyptian governorates. It also sought to connect these terminals to a training center in ‘Mubarak Education City’ in the city of ‘6th of October’ (Arabic: السادس من أكتوبر‎) within Giza Governorate. Each terminal was equipped with video, audio, and remote white board devices. Phase 2 involved an expansion of the network from 33 terminals to 143 terminals in 27 Egyptian governorates. The purpose of Phase 3 is to expand, upgrade, and  transform the measures and technologies already put in place during Phase 1 and 2. It involves an expansion of the network from 143 terminals to 200 terminals (through the installation of audio-visual technologies in 57 additional Egyptian schools). Its ultimate aim is to address a lack of teachers in some schools by connecting students and teachers through audio-visual technologies. Phase 1 project design work began in late 2001. MOFCOM then issued a Phase 1 implementation contract to ZTE Corporation in August 2002.    Phase 1 was officially completed and handed over to the local authorities on March 18, 2003.

67039,"INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",Bank of China provides EUR 2 billion loan for Power of Siberia Gas Pipeline Project,"In March 2016, Bank of China and Gazprom — a Russian state-owned energy corporation — signed a 2 billion euro loan facility agreement for the Power of Siberia Gas Pipeline Project. The loan carried the following terms: a 5-year maturity and an annual interest rate of EURIBOR (-0.134% in March 2016) plus a 3.5% margin.   The project involved the construction of a 3,000 kilometer gas pipeline that traverse the Irkutsk and Amur Regions and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The pipeline route passes through swampy, mountainous, seismically active, permafrost and rocky areas with extreme environmental conditions. The absolute lowest air temperatures along the Power of Siberia route range from –41 degrees Celsius in the Amur Region to –62 degrees Celsius in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The project was implemented in three phases (or sections): the first phase (section) of pipeline construction ran some 2,200 kilometers from the Chayandinskoye field (Yakutia) to Blagoveshchensk (Chinese border); the second phase (section) of pipeline construction ran some 800 kilometers from Kovyktinskoye field (Irkutsk Region) to the Chayandinskoye field; and the the third phase involved an expansion of gas transmission capacities between the Chayandinskoye field and Blagoveshchensk.   China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. In May 2014, Gazprom and CNPC signed a Sales and Purchase Agreement for gas to be supplied via the eastern route (Power of Siberia gas pipeline). The 30-year agreement provides for Russian gas deliveries to China in the amount of 38 billion cubic meters per year. Then, on September 1, 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin and then member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli attended a groundbreaking ceremony for phase 1 (the eastern line) of the Power of Siberia Gas Pipeline Project in Yakutskiy. On June 29, 2015, the construction of the natural gas pipeline in China officially started. In December 2015, Gazprom signed an agreement with CNPC to design and construct the cross-border section of the pipeline, including the submerged crossing under the Amur River. In May 2017, a temporary two-way checkpoint was opened on the Russian-Chinese border to provide unfettered access to the border area for construction equipment and personnel.As of mid-February 2018, Gazprom had completed the construction of 1,521 kilometers of the pipeline. On December 2, 2019, the pipeline was put into operation and the first-ever pipeline supplies of Russian gas to China were launched.","1.

66961,BUSINESS AND OTHER SERVICES,China Eximbank provides $170 million preferential buyer’s credit for Great Stone Industrial Park Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#66959 and #96419),"On January 17, 2013, China Development Bank signed a financing agreement with a China-Belarus joint venture and project company called CJSC “Industrial Park Development Company” (中白工业园区开发股份有限 or China-Belarus Industrial Park Development Company or CBIPDC or Компания по развитию индустриального парка) for the Great Stone Industrial Park Construction Project. The face value of the loan that CDB subsequently approved is $110 million.   Then, on May 10, 2015, China Eximbank and the Government of Belarus signed a $170 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK № РВС (2015) 9 (351)] for the Great Stone Industrial Park Construction Project.  The PBC originally carried a maturity of 15 years and a grace period of 6 years. Its interest rate is unknown.   Joint Stock Company ""Savings Bank"" Belarusbank (JSC JSSB Belarusbank) is the agent bank responsible for servicing the PBC. The proceeds of the CDB loan (captured via Project ID#66959) and the China Eximbank PBC (captured via Project ID#66961) were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract with China CAMC Engineering Co., Ltd. (CAMCE).  The purpose of the project was to construct the infrastructure of the Great Stone Industrial Park (also known as the China-Belarus Industrial Park or Індустрыяльны парк «Вялікі камень» or Индустриальный парк «Великий камень»), which is located in the Smolevichi district between the Petrovichi reservoir and Minsk National Airport (25 km to the east of the capital city of Minsk). It involved the construction of 13 km of two-way, six lane roads inside the park; the installation of water supply, drainage, power supply, gas supply, communications systems; the construction of office buildings, warehouses, and factories; and the construction of a 110 kV transformer substation, six 10 kV distributions, 90 km power supply lines, one water supply plant, one rainwater treatment plant, one water intake station, and one secondary lift pump station. The park was designed to attract global high-tech enterprises with a focus on electronics, biomedicine, and engineering.     CAMCE — a subsidiary of Sinomach — was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by CJSC “Industrial Park Development Company”.  The construction of the park, which was modeled on the China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park, began on June 19, 2014. Then, on May 12, 2015, Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan inspected the project site in the company of H.E. Belarusian President Lukashenko. Construction, which was originally scheduled for completion in 2018, was completed on or around October 16, 2017.   CJSC “Industrial Park Development Company” was founded on August 27, 2012 and it is jointly owned by Sinomach (32%), CAMCE (13.71%), China Merchants Group (20%), Harbin Investment Group (2.29%), and the Government of Belarus (32%). Its creation followed the signing of an intergovernmental agreement on the China-Belarus Industrial Park on September 18, 2011 and the subsequent ratification of the agreement by both countries on January 30, 2012. Then, on June 5, 2012, a special legal, regulatory, customs and tax regime was granted to businesses operating within the China-Belarus Industrial Park, providing favorable terms for resident businesses and investors.  By the end of 2014, only two companies —  affiliates of HUAWEI and ZTE — were operating in the industrial park. However, by May 2017, 13 companies were operating in the park and 10 additional companies — from China, Belarus, Russia, Austria, the USA and Lithuania — began operating in the park by the end of 2017. Then, in May 2017, the first stage of the China‑Belarus Commerce & Logistics Park was commissioned. About $120 million was invested in the construction of this logistics subpark with a total area of 100,000 m2. During the first quarter of 2018, Duisburger Hafen AG (duisport) acquired a 1% stake in CBIPDC, and as part of the transaction, a rail terminal (including a logistics area) was to be built, led by duisport, as well as China Merchants China‑Belarus, the Belarus state‑owned railway and Hupac Intermodal (Swiss), Europe’s leading intermodal (and green logistics) provider. As of August 2018, there were 36 companies were operating in the park (20 from China and 16 from Austria, Belarus, Germany, Israel, Lithuania, Russia, and the USA). By July 2019, there were 44 companies operating in park.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan (PBC) for the Great Stone Industrial Park Construction Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. The lender extended the loan's grace period by an additional year in November 2020 (as captured via Project ID#96419). The Government of Belarus showed signs of financial distress before and after the grace period extension was offered. In 2019, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported that international reserves had fallen 'well below adequacy metrics', covering a mere 2 months of imports. On December 16, 2019, China Development Bank stepped into the breach and issued an RMB 3.5 billion ($500 million) emergency loan to Ministry of Finance of Belarus. It explicitly authorized the borrower to use the proceeds of the loan to repay existing debts and shore up the country's foreign exchange reserves. Then, on July 14, 2022, the Government of Belarus defaulted on its USD-denominated Eurobond payment. As of April 2023, it was attempting to meet its Eurobond payment obligations in local currency, in contravention of bond documentation that does not allow for settlement in alternative currencies. This local currency payment strategy was taken as Western sanctions against the Government of Belarus tightened due to its support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.","1.
